SECRETARY OF TATE NORTHERN IRELAND: POINTS FOR CABINET 
The following list of topics for possible discussion in Cabinet this evening is framed against the background that: 
(i) the PM is unable to hold a separate meeting on Northern Ireland before Cabinet, but would be willing to hold one immediately after Cabinet if you so wished, with Philip Allen and Stewart Crawford. 
(ii) AUS(GS) will be visiting Belfast tomorrow, departing early in the morning, for talks with the GOC and others. 
2. 
The points for possible discussion this evening are: a. 
Interrogation of Detainees We are told that 
the RUC team who have been doing the interrogation have already obtained so much material that they want to break off the questioning while they analyse the information already gleaned. This has been agreed by Stout, and the Army team which has been supporting the RUC has been told to prepare to withdraw. DGI considers that a complete halt would be very bad tactics and that at least some of the RUC team should continue the questioning while others are analysing the material already obtained. There is some urgency about this since, once the teams have been stood down,it will take time to re-activate them. 
Hockaday, who has already raised the point 
with Home Office, suggests that you simply draw attention to it and say that, unless there are any objections from colleagues, you propose to get the GOC and UK Rep to pursue it with the NI Government. 
It is a little doubtful whether this item 
ought to be discussed in full Cabinet but, if you are not keen on a separate meeting, there is probably no real objection to raising it in Cabinet.

confirmed to me orally that 
a. The reinforcement divers in the contingency plan should be despatched to HMS MAIDSTONE as soon as can be arranged. 
b. There is no decision yet as to whether MAIDSTONE should be modified to accommodate the larger figure of internees but Mr. Matthews and Captain Cook or their deputies if they are not available) should hold themselves at immediate readiness to proceed to Northern Ireland to offer expert advice to the authorities there on what should be done and how best it should be done. 
I understand that you have received much the same information from DMO through the operational channel. 
2. The purpose of this note is to confirm that you have already 
set action in hand on a. above with Second Sea lord’s Department and are taking preliminary action on b. possibly 
suggesting that either Captain Cook or Mr. Matthews may prefer to go over now as a precautionary measure even if a decision is ultimately taken by the Army not to modify MAIDSTONE at all. 
I spoke to DPR(N) this morning, warned him what was going 
on, and, as agreed with DS6, advised him that any questions on MAIDSTONE should be referred to the Army PR desk. He had already been alerted to this by CPR.

A/BR/20201/19/MO 3 AS (GS) NORTHERN IRELAND 
1. If the pakage deal does indeed turn out to be internment in exchange for a ban on parades for six months coupled with no new rifle clubs, the following thoughts occur to me. 
2. The package deal itself. 
a. Internment. In Whitehall we do not know enough about the list of 520? possible internees. Whose property is this list once Mr FAULKNER requests the deal and HMG agrees it? Who are the Protestants on this list? Accepting that we know the criteria for selection, who has been considered and discarded and why? Is the list of wanted men to be made public once internment is introuced? If not why not, as information about known and publicied wanted men is bound to be more available than about faceless men? 
b. The ban on parades. What does this really mean? How flexible is this ban? Surely there would be merit in preserving some room for manoeuvre for HMG by agreeing in private to a six month ban (subject to review?) but saying in public that the ban is ’until further notice’. This would have a probably good effect on Catholics. If for six months, is the ban until 10 Jan or 31 Jan 72? (NB the last ban was lifted on 31 Jan 71). 
o. No new rifle clubs. This presumably means that rifle clubs which are already reistered can continue. What about those clubs which have applied for registration but still awaiting it? An alarm. ng increase in such applications was reported some weeks ago. 
hopes that ’no new 
rifle clubs’ means’membership of rifle clubs is frozen’, or ’only those rifle clubs already legally registered on 7 Au 71 may continue’; or better still, ’only those legally registered before the flood of applications whatever selected date that might be - may continue’. In effect this measure means nothing. There are reported to be 102 leally registered clubs, and unless membership is frozen, new applicants 
will mearly join existing 
clubs rather than form new ones. Of the 102 legally registered clubs only about 90 actually exist, because club secretaries automatically renew annual applications but the club may be dormant. The actual distribution of clubs throughout the province by Police Divisions is:

INTERNMENT: NORTHERN IRELAND 1. 
I feel you would wish to be aware that the DIS has NO hard 
intelligence that the parade in Londonderry on the 12th is likely to attract any greater terrorist activity than was foreseen last week or indeed at any time in the past before such a parado. 
stepping up trainig in the South this week; 2. In support of the above I can report:- 
a. there is NO sign of any unusual increase in IRA strength (either faction) in Londonderry up to today; nor have we any knowledge of IRA plans to reinforce their units in that city. 
b. Nor do we have any intelligence suggesting firm plans for protestant activity by any extremist group such as the Ulster Volunteer Force. 
3. As recently as 2 August 1971 the Director of Intelligence 
made a formal assessment reporting that if the parade was banned the Protestants would regard it as a major sell-out to the Republicans: there was consequent talk of serious disorders if this should happen. The Director further reported that Republican are publicly advocating the need for plans to be made for "disruptive activity", should internment be introduced. 
4. In sum, I have NO new intelligence indicators to support the view that the Apprentices Boys March is now more likely than we have previously judged to result in danger to life and limb lot alone that it will be a "blood bath". Such a risk as you well know inevitably exists, but there has been nothing over the last few days suggesting any dramatic change for the worse. 
We do know from one CX report that Bradyites may be we do recognise 
that there is a state of increased sectarian tension; but all this is completely true to form in such circumstances.

I ran through a number of possible methods of improving security in Londonderry on 12 August - further reinforcements, 
calling out UDR (which he will probably do anyway), another Op Linklater just before the march, stiffening up the Yellow Card but these are in his view either non-starters or of little value. The area affected by the march is so small that even if we produced more troops from UK not deploy them.

ANNEX A TO Dated 4 Aug 71. 
THE MAIDSTONE - REQUIRMENTS 1. 141 Bulkhead 3 dock level, does not mako a natural barrier as it is open plan 
on this deck at this point. The natural security boundary is at 131 bulkhead, wh the only access to the remainder of the ship is through two watertight doors. It is proposed that this be the limit of the security area and that these doors be me secure by the yielding of hasps for the fitting of padlocks on the forward aide of the bulkhead. 
2. It will be necessary to provide a wire securing strop with padlock to prevent 
exit from 3 deck to 2 dock through the hatch at 151 station on two deck. 3. 
To give access to the recreation area on the quarterdeck from the security a 
of the ship it will be necessary to surround the hatch at 151 station, 2 dock with a wire cage from deck level to the deckhead. This will prevent exit from 3 deck. to the guard areas on 2 deck. A door will be required in this cage which will be 10 x 7 feet in area. 
4. A six foot high barrier of barbed wire will be required around the perimeter 
of the quarterdeck. This is visualised as the recreation area 5. 
Exit from the secure area is possible through some sixty ship side souttles. 
It is not considered feasible to weld bars over these in the time scale envisaged and it is also considered that a requirement exists for the scuttle to be opened for ventilation. In these circumstances it is necessary to cover these scuttles with a barbed wire screen which will cover the side of the ship around this area. The screen can be secured to the coil pipe at the waterlevel and to the quarterde guard rails at the upper deck level. 
6. Six hot lockers will have to be fitted in the senior rates messes between 13 and 141 bulkheads on 3 deck. 
7. Forty 2’6" square tables will be required for dining halls. These are not. available in the ship. All other domestic requirements can be met. 8. 
The messdeck on 4 deck between 131 and 141 bulkheads is envisaged as an 
accommodation space. At present it and the storerooms underneath on 5 deck are fully utilised for storage spaces. It will be necessary to provide a working party of approximately forty to clear these storerooms and restow the contents elsewhere if the time scale envisaged 
to be met.

4th August 1971 NORTHERN IRELAND This is to confirm our telephone conversation this 
morning. The Defence Secretary is content with the substance 
of the Home Secretary’s proposed message to Mr. Faulkner enclosed with your letter of yesterday, subject to the insertion of the words "in present circumstances" between "not" and "recommending" in the first line of paragraph 3. 
I should perhaps add that while endorsing the GOC’s’view 
that internment should not at present be recommended on military grounds the Ministry of Defence entirely accepts that the final decision must rest with Ministers who will have to take into account both military and political considerations. In the light of the GOC’s advice against the banning of the Apprentice Boys’ procession on 12th August the feeling here is that we should postpone any decision about internment until after the march has taken place and we have been able to evaluate thoroughly the desirability and implications of such a decision.

Northern Ireland 
The Nature of the Problem This note sets out to analyse the nature of the 
problem facing the United Kingdom Government, the factors that affect the range of possible solutions. 
First, what 
is the problem of Northern Ireland? Different people would give different answers even to this preliminary question, but one may venture the proposition that the problem consists in finding a means whereby all the people of Northern Ireland can enjoy as full and free a life in the Province as they cod anywhere else. 
But this 
objective can never be fully achieved; any solution is bound to be second best. 
Innate divisions The division between the two communities is innate 
and must be expected to last for a very long time to come. It is often said that the religious difference is nominal and that Protestants and Roman Catholics are merely convenient labels by which to describe a difference in national loyalties. 
That is to some extent true, but the 
truly religious nature of the division is not to be overlooked. 
The difference is aggravated because the 
dominant sects lie at extremes of Christian doctrine: Catholicism and Calvinism and the formal practice of religion is very strong/ 
The relative isolation of 
Ireland keeps alive religious tensions that have died elsewhere. 
In Northern Ireland the communities are intermingled 
in a way which, generally speaking and subject to what is said below, admits of no further geographical partitioning. The Unionist Protestants build a fortress through fear of being engulfed in Catholic Ireland. 
The Roman Catholic 
nationalists regard themselves as subjects of an alien colonial rule and live in fear that the Protestants will destroy them. 
This innate difference in national loyalty 
transcends all other political forces; and its foundation is fear.

1. THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A STATEMENT ISSUED ON 13 AUGUST BY MR. O’MALLEY (MINISTER FOR JUSTICE) IN REPLY TO MR FAULKNER’S ACCUSATIONS THAT THE IRISH GOVERNMENT TOLERATES THE ACTIVITIES OF THE I RA. BEGINS. MR. FAULKNER CANNOT EXCUSE THE SHORTCOMMINGS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION BY ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT HERE. THE GOVERNMENT HAVE TAKEN EFFECTIVE STEPS TO STAMP OUT THE ACTIVITIES OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANISATIONS ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER. GOVERNMENT POLICY IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THE FIREARMS ACT, 1971, WHICH INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY THE PENALTIES FOR THE UNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF MILITARY TYPE FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION. IN THE COURSE OF THE DEBATE ON THIS MEASURE 1 EXPRESSED THE DETERMINATION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PUT DOWN THE UNAUTHORISED USE OF FIREARMS AND ESPECIALLY THE USE OF MILITARY TYPE WEAPONS. THE ACT PUTS BEYOND DOUBT THAT THE VERY SERIOUS OFFENCE OF BEING IN POSSESSION OF FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION WITH THE INTENTION OF ENDANGERING LIFE OR OF CAUSING SERIOUS INJURY TO PROPERTY IS COMMITTED JUST AS FULLY, WHETHER THE PERSON OR PROPERTY IS OUTSIDE THE STATE OR WITHIN THE JURISDICTION. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES OF ARMS, AMMUNITION AND EXPLOSIVES HAVE BEE IN SIEZED BY THE GARDAl. THE BORDER IS AND HAS BEEN PATROLLED TO PREVENT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE THE PASSAGE OF ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES. SINCE 1969 GARDA PATROLS HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED BY ARMY PATROLS. EARLIER THIS WEEK I DIRECTED THAT EXTRA GARDAI AND CARS BE SENT TO THE BORDER. /I DO NOT

Both Peter Gregson and I looked quickly at the 1967 Study by the Conservative Research Department. 
As you 
will recall when you read it again, this was really commissioned as a justification for the existing constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland. 
It 
does not therefore itself seek to put forward any ideas for dealing with the Irish problem. On the other hand, it is a very thorough historical and comparative study, and more detailed examination may produce some thoughts. Neil Cairncross has been given it to read before noting down his own ideas. I am afraid I am myself extremely pessimistic, which 
leads me, even looking to the longer term, to attach greatest single importance to building up our capacity to maintain law and order in Northern Ireland. 
My 
assessment is this: There is no single measure which can dramatically improve the situation. 
Politically there is no alternative to a gradual process of (i) reducing or removing Catholic grievances; and 
(ii) constantly re-assuring the Protestants. 
This can only be done very slowly and unfortunately it is in itself a recipe for continuing unrest and violence. The more we fail to contain the unrest and the violence, the slower and more difficult will be the political process.

Because of the My own feeling is At the moment there seems 
to be a strong feeling that we should be putting Mr. Lynch in his place and do everything we can to give moral support to the Stormont Government. 
This was the feeling that 
came through at Henry’s lobby on Friday afternoon. Sir Harry Legge-Bourke rang me and also I believe the Home Secretary to urge that we should say something to "back up Mr. Faulkner". I am sure that we shall have to get Mr. Faulkner 
over within the next week or two and also that we shall have to try and get him to accept something on the lines of the Home Secretary’s proposal.

I am afraid Mr Faulkner’s reaction to my proposal was very negative. 
The line he is taking is that he cannot sit down with the Catholics but that he must await their return to Stormont in October. In the meanwhile we should continue to express interest in, and support for his reform policies. 
I do not think this will do. They are not going to return to Stormont 
as a beaten group and we cannot wait until October. I think it must be clear that in these circumstances and with such 
large British forces committed, HMG must take some positive line. We have no disagreement with Mr Faulkner’s ideas on the Constitution which, so far as they go, are sound, and they go a long way. The simple fact is that they will not be accepted coming from him alone. The object of any exercise must be to put over ideas of participation by their minority community in a joint HMG/Faulkner framework. This must mean restoring contact with the minority community and doing it in a UK context. 
It seems to me that we should get Faulkner over here in a few days 
time to discuss the next step. We shall need a few days for preparation. In the meantime I would hope that an announcement that he is coming over for consultations about the next move will help to deal with the volume of criticism that is bound to arise to the effect that we are merely backing up Stormont and making no positive move of our own.

TO IMMEDIATE DUBLIN TELEGRAM NUMBER 166 OF 13 AUGUST INFO UKREP BELFAST. MY TEL NO 163, PARA. 2A. DR. HILLERY ADVANCED THE VIEW AT THE MEETING, FREQUENTLY REPORTED BY IRISH PAPERS, THAT THE ARMY EITHER TOLERATE OR DO NOT ACTIVELY SEEK O’JT SNIPERS FROM THE PROTESTANT SIDE. NEITHER ALLEGATION IS TRUE. GOC NORTHERN IRELAND HAS INVESTIGATED REPORTS OF PROTESTANT SNIPERS AND HAS NO FIRM EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE OPERATING. PROTESTANT ACTIVITY OCCURRED IN ONE AREA ON 9 AUGUST: IN THE CRUMLIN-ARDOYNE AREA ON 10 AUGUST: AND IN THE ARDOYNE SHOPS AREA ON 11 AUGUST, BUT ONLY ON SECOND OCCASION DID SHOOTING OCCUR, AND HERE BOTH PROTESTANTS AND ROMAN CATHOLICS WERE SHOOTING. THE ECONOMIST’S VERDICT (THAT PROTESTANT ARMED MOBS ARE A FABRICATION OF FEVERED OR FANCIFUL MINDS IN DUBLIN PRESS) SEEMS JUSTIFIED. ALL THE INFORMATION WE HAVE SUGGESTS THAT AMONG THE PROTESTANTS THERE ARE MANY WITH VIOLENT TONGUES BUT FEW WITH THE INCLINATION TO ORGANISE AND FIGHT AS THE IRA HAVE DONE. MOST OF THE RECENT STORIES EMANATING FROM ROMAN CATHOLIC SOURCES IN BELFAST DISPLAY AN INVENTIVENESS BASED NO DOUBT ON A MIXTURE OF FEAR AND HATRED, BUT IF RESPONSIBLE IRISH AUTHORITIES CAN PROVIDE GENUINE INTELLIGENCE 
- I.E. NAMES AND DETAILS - WE SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM. 
2. DR. HILLERY SAID THAT THE IDENTITY OF PROTESTANT SNIPERS WHO WERE ACTUALLY SHOOTING WAS WELL KNOWN. PLEASE SEE HIM AND ASK HIM TO SUPPLY DETAILS. IF HE TURNS THE REQUEST ASIDE ON THE GROUND THAT HIS INFORMATION IS BASED ON WHAT OTHERS TELL HIM, YOU SHOULD ASK HIM TO GET THE DETAILS FROM THEM. HE CAN BE ASSURED THAT ANY HARD INTELLIGENCE WILL BE VIGOROUSLY FOLLOWED UP.

Northern Ireland Reform Programme You might like to look again at the list of reforms, 
which the Home Secretary handed to you this morning. You asked about our own practice in giving chairmanships 
to Opposition Members. As the attached note shows the 
position at Westminster is that Opposition Members have the chairmanships of 3 Committees and 7 sub-Committees. By comparison Government Members have the chairmanships of 10 Committees (Expenditure, Services, Nationalised Industries, Privileges, Procedure, Civil List, Corporation Tax, Race Relations and Immigration, Science and Technology and Scottish Affairs) as well as 10 sub-Committees; (this excludes the various procedural committees like Selection, Standing Orders, Consolidation, etc.). 
So 
Mr. Faulkner’s suggestion that the Opposition should chair 2 out of the 4 Committees at Stormont was a generous one.

MY 2 IPT S : STATEMENT BY TAOISEACH. 1. 
THE TAOISEACH’S STATEMENT (MY TELNO 317) FINALLY EMERGED 
AFTER A CABINET MEETING THAT HAD LASTED VIRTUALLY ALL DAY. IT SHOULD BE STUDIED TOGETHER WITH HIS SUBSEQUENT ANSWER TO QUESTIONS FROM JOURNALISTS(MY TELNO 318). 
THE FOLLOWING ARE MY IMMEDIATE 
COMMENTS. 2.(I) 
THE CONTENT, STYLE, AND MANNER OF DELIVERY OF THE STATEMENT 
ALL SUGGEST THAT IT WAS THE PRODUCT OF A CABINET FORCED TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF ALL THE STRANDS OF OPINION INSIDE FIANNA FAIL. IT THEREFORE HAS A LARGE DOMESTIC POLITICAL ELEMENT. 
CONTAINS NOTHING THAT MR LYNCH HAS NOT ALREADY SAID IN PRIVATE ITS REAL SIGNIFICANCE IS THAT HE HAS NOW SAID IT IN PUBLIC. 
(11) MR LYNCH HAS REJECTED ALL SUPPORT OF THE IRA, GUNMEN, GUNRUNNERS, ARMED INTERVENSIONISTS, UN INTERVENTIONISTS AND HARD LINE POLICIES ADVOCATED BY VARIOUS MEMBERS OF FIANNA FAIL. 
(II) HAVING OPTED EXPLICITLY FOR POLITICAL MEANS OF PROTECT- 
ING THE MINORITIES IN THE NORTH, HE WAS FORCED TO TAKE A HARD POLITICAL LINE. 
(IV) THE IDEAL OF REUNIFICATION IS RELEGATED TO THE BACK- 
GROUND. PEACE AND JUSTICE IN THE NORTH ARE BOTH ESSENTIAL NOW AND A NECESSARY PRECONDITION OF ULTIMATE UNIFICATION. 
(V) THE HARD POLITICAL LINE IS TO DEMAND THE END OF THE STORMONT 
REGIME, AND ITS REPLACEMENT BY AN ADMINISTRATION SHARED EQUALLY BETWEEN UNIONIST AND NON-UNIONIST (HE DID NOT SAY PROTESTANT). 
BUT THE STATEMENT

HOME SECRETARY’S MEETING WITH MR. FITT AND MR. HUME the Home Office. 
On Wednesday 11th August the Home Secretary saw Mr. Fitt and Mr. Hume at Mr. Angel was also present. 
Mr. Hume began by formally asking that all internees should be released. 
If this could not be done he asked for assurances about the conditions in which they were to be kept and complained that Members of Parliament had been denied access to them. 
According to his information most of those arrested were 
people publicly identified with the Republican movement over a long time rather than those active in violence. Mr. Fitt asked that where it was established that innocent people had 
died as a result of the recent violence, their families should be compensated. He said that Catholics were incensed at the army’s methods of searching which involved wrecking any premises they searched. 
he described as a British army handbook quoting an alleged Sinn Fein oath to ’wade knee deep in Protestant blood’. Mr. Hume then said that the main purpose of their visit was to put He and his colleagues deplored the violence on the They had tried to lead their communities

away from violence, even to the point of being stoned by their own supporters. The Provisional IRA was born in 1969 as a reaction to the Protestant attack on the Falls Road. 
As the situation had developed the opportunities for 
moderation had diminished and even their cautious welcome for Mr. Faulkner’s initiative on Parliamentary committees had led their constituents to accuse them of selling out. 
They could not now go back to Stormont. He referred to a document which Indeed they 
would be useless and represent no-one if they did. The difficulty was that the Catholic population did not have confidence When this confidence was lacking repression on If confidence was to be restored,

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS ISSUED ABOUT 9 PM THIS EVENING ON BEHALF OF THE TAOISEACH. 
QUOTE. 
DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS EVERY EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT MERELY TO PREVENT THE DETERIORATION OF THE SITUATION IN THE NORTH BUT TO OBTAIN THE IMPLEMENTATION THERE OF SUCH POLICIES AS WOULD PROVIDE AND PROTECT THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE NON UNIONISTS IN THE POPULATION 
. WE HAVE 
REPEATEDLY EXHORTED THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES TO COMPLETE THIS TASK WITH THE UTMOST SPEED AND IN FULL MEASURE. WE HAVE ASKED THE NORTHERN MINORITY TO BE PATIENT AND TO ACCEPT THATIT WAS THE INTENTION OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO HONOUR THE DOWNING STREET DECLARATION OF 19TH AUGUST 1969. WE HAVE ALSO ASKED THEM TO REJECT THE USE OF VIOLENCE BECAUSE NOT ONLY WOULD VIOLENCE PRECLUDE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS BUT IT WOULD PERPETUATE THE DIVISIONS AMONG THE IRISH PEOPLE. 
WE HAVE ACTED WITH RESPONSIBILITY AND RESTRAINT THROUGHOUT ALL THE DIFFICULTIES OF THEPAST TWO YEARS. WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED IN THE NORTH IN THE PAST FEW DAYS NOW COMPELS US TO STATE OUT POSITION WITH COMPLETE CLARITY. 
THE VIOLENT REACTION TO THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL IN THE NORTH, WHICH IS SEEN TO BE A DELIBERATE DECISION BY THE STORMONT ADMINISTRATION TO ATTEMPT THE OUTRIGHT REPRESSION OF THE MINORITY, IS NOT SURPRISING. BUT MY GOVERNMENT MUST MAKE DECISIONS IN THE LIGHT OF THE REALITIES THAT EXIST: PARTICULARLY SO WHEN EMOTIONS RUN HIGH. THESE REALITIES INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THE MAIN VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE PEOPLE IN AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY VICTIMISED BY THE STORMONT SYSTEM. IT IS ALREADY THE CASE THAT INNOCENT WOMEN, CHILDREN AND MEN 
OF PEACE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES SINCE MONDAY. IT IS NOT THE WISH OF THE GOVERNMENT TO BE IN ANY WAY A CAUSE OF AN ESCALATION OF AN ALREADY GRAVE SITUATION OR TO SEE ANY ADDITION TO THE TOLL OF DEATH, UNJURY AND DESTRUCTION. THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT 
, THEREFORE, 
CONDONE ANY ACTIONS WHICH WILL LEAD TO SUCH AN ESCALATION AND CANNOT AND WILL NOT SUPPORT ANY ARMED ACTIVITY WHICH WILL INEVITABLY CAUSE FURTHER SUFFERING AND DEATH. 
WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH ELECTED LEADERS OF THE NORTHERN MINORITY IN THE PAST FEW DAYS. WE ARE UNITED WITH THEM IN OUR DETERMINATION TO ENSURE THAT THE MISGOVERNMENT TO WHICH THE NORTH HAS BEEN SUBJECTED FOR SO LONG SHALL END. THE BEST METHOD OF ACHIEVING THIS OBJECTIVE IS THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS. WE HAVE NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THE SUBJECTION OF THE MINORITY IN THE NORTH TO UNJUST LAW, BIASED ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE WILL COME TO A CONCLUSION THROUGH DETERMINED POLITICAL ACTION. 
WE HOPE THE BRITISH PEOPLE WILL COME TO REALISE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF NORTHERN IRELAND IS NOW AND HAS BEEN SINCE IT WAS CREATED DIRECTED AT THE SUPPRESSION OF THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE POPULATION. WE KNOW THAT THE BRITISH PUBLIC, IF FULLY AWARE OF THE FACTS, WOULD TURN AWAY IN HORROR FROM WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO SUPPORT, FINANCIAALLY AND OTHERWISE, ALL THESE YEARS IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
THE CASE CAN BE SIMPLY STATED. THERE EXISTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND A GOVERNMENT WHOSE MAIN CONCERN APPEARS TO BE TO MEET THE WISHES AND DEMANDS OF THE MOST EXTREME ELEMENTS WITHIN THE UNIONIST COMMUNITY. THAT GOVERNMENT IS HEADED BY ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE DOWNING STREET DECLARATION WHICHGUARANTEED EQUALITY OF TREATMENT FOR EVERYONE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IRRESPECTIVE OF POLITICAL VIEWS OR RELIGION. DURING THE TWO YEARS WHICH HAVE ELAPSED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT DECLARATION HAS BEEN DELAYED AND DISTORTED. 
WHATEVER WERE THE INTENTIONS EMBODIED IN THE DECLARATION IT NOW HAS NO CREDIBILITY FOR THE NON-UNIONIST POPULATION AS THEY CAN SEE THE EXTENT OF THE INFLUENCE AND EVEN CONTROL EXERCISED ON THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT BY UNIONIST EXTREMISTS. 
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE ARE SATISFIED THAT, AS AN IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE OF POLITICAL ACTION, THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE REPLACED BY AN ADMINISTRATION IN WHICH POWER AND DECISION-MAKING WILL BE EQUALLY SHARED BETWEEN UNIONIST AND NON-UNIONIST. 
THE STORMONT REGIME, WHICH HAS CONSISTENTLY REPRESSED THE NONUNIONIST POPULATION AND BEARS RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECURRING VIOLENCE IN THE NORTHERN COMMUNITY, MUST BE BROUGHT TO AN END. WE CALL ON ALL IRISH PEOPLE, NORTH AND SOUTH, WHO ARE OPPOSED BOTH TO REPRESSION AND VIOLENCE TO JOIN TOGETHER IN POLITICAL ACTION AIMED AT THIS OBJECTIVE. 
THIS IS A SURER ROAD TO PEACE WITH JUSTICE THAN SELF-DESTRUCTIVE VIOLENCE.

TEXT OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR LYNCH AND THE PRIME MINISTER AT 4.11 PM ON THURSDAY l0 AUGUST 1971 
Greetings exchanged. 
MR. LYNCH The first thing is, I take it that Maudling has 
PRIME MINISTER Yes he has, he reported to me last evening. 
MR. LYNCH The main specific suggestion made there 
any reaction to it. PRIME MINISTER The suggestion about the Commission? 
MR. LYNCH Yes. 
PRIME MINISTER Well, obviously we have considered it. The Home 
Secretary I think explained to Dr. Hillery yesterday that he couldn’t consider anything that meant constitutional change as such. But that we would give further thought to any way in which we can help as far as bringing the minority into all these activities is concerned. 
MR. LYNCH Yes I see, yes, but 
... In the meantime Mr. Maudling 
said that he did not want to give any indications that this had been discussed. I am being hounded as you can well imagine here. I have absolutely refrained from meeting anybody in order not to do anything that might endanger the present situation. But I may yet float an idea of some suggestion of a constitutional change or some structural alteration without indicating at all that it was put up to Mr. Maudling. I feel that I have to be free at least to float that idea myself in the absence of an agreement from you. I did not think there would be, having heard or having received Mr. Maudling’s views yesterday. So you will understand that if this happens that I am not going to pin it on you, Mr. Maudling or your Government that some structural alteration might be necessary in order to involve the minority in a political way. 
- I wonder if it was considered - and if it was whether there was 
reported to you on the talks he had with Paddy Hillery yesterday.

Government. 
Dr. Hillery said that he had been sent by his Cabinet to see the British He thought the current policies would lead to war in Ireland, not 
only the North. He said that the IRA had been re-created as a reaction to the 
British Government’s policies of preserving the dominance of the Orange Order. He claimed that the Orange Order still ran the Northern Ireland Government and referred to Mr. Faulkner as having gone to a secret meeting of the Orange Lodge for instructions before visiting London. 
He said that following these 
policies would destroy relations between the United Kingdom and the Republic and claimed that the urgency of the situation was not appreciated by the United Kingdom Government. The Home Secretary said that the policy of the United Kingdom Government 
was to support the lawfully and democratically elected Government in Northern Ireland.

Internment had been introduced because the Government was faced with It was in the common interest of both 
countries to combat the activities of gunmen and it was hoped that the Government of the Republic would be able to help achieve that objective.

THE HOME SECRETARY ACCOMPANIED BY MINISTER OF STATE AT THE 
FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE RECEIVED DR. HILLERY THIS MORNING AND DISCUSSED THE SITUATION. A FULL RECORD WILL FOLLOW BUT THE FOLLOWING WERE THE MAIN POINTS. 
2. (A) DR. HILLERY SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN SENT BY HIS GOVERNMENT 
TO EXPLAIN THEIR VIEWS. THEY SAW THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT AS A DELIBERATE CHOICE OF THE USE OF FORCE RATHER THAN POLITICAL MEANS, TO CONTROL THE SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND. THIS WOULD PRODUCE NO SOLUTION, WOULD BUILD UP THE IRA, AND WOULD HAVE VERY SERIOUS RESULTS THROUGH EXACERBATING SECTARIAN STRIFE, ENDANGERING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC AND THE U.K. AND, HE HINTED, PUTTING THE FUTURE OF MR. LYNCH’S GOVERNMENT AT RISK. THE HOME SECRETARY EXPLAINED THE BACKGROUND TO THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT AS MADE NECESSARY BY THE RECENT INCREASE IN VIOLENCE AT A TIME WHEN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT HAD BEEN MOVING FORWARD: HE EMPHASISED THAT THE MEASURE WAS NON-DISCRIMINATORY AND AIMED ONLY AT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR VIOLENCE, AND THAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO RESTORE A MORE PEACEFUL SITUATION IN WHICH REFORMS COULD CONTINUE. DR. HILLERY REPLIED THAT OUR ACTION WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD IN THIS WAY. EVEN HE HIMSELF SAW IT AS A WEAPON TO CONSOLIDATE THE RULE OF THE UNIONISTS (WHICH IN DISCUSSION HE FREQUENTLY EQUATED WITH THE ORANGE ORDER), AND ASSERTED THAT THOSE INTERNED WERE SIMPLY THE TALKERS IN THE MINORITY AND NOT THE GUNMEN: NO ACTION WAS BEING TAKEN AGAINST THE UNIONIST SNIPERS WHOSE IDENTITY WAS KNOWN AND WHO WERE AT LARGE AND ACTIVE. 
HE THOUGHT THAT HMG SHOULD DO MORE TO EXPLAIN THEIR POLICY AND SEE THAT IT WAS BETTER UNDERSTOOD.

The Press - particularly Leader Writers - have on the 
whole accepted the inevitability of the use of special powers in Northern Ireland and their attitude has been constructive. As the disturbances have continued since Monday morning, there has been a slight decline of confidence 
- largely from the 
mistaken assumption at the out set that the use of internment would remove all terrorists and intimidation. 
position has been clear enough. It was accepted at the 
beginning that you had no alternative but to embark on Saturday and that all decisions had been taken before your departure. As the disturbances continue, however, there has been a growing feeling that you should be in London, culminating in a major Daily Mail "Comment" today "Urgent: A Helicopter for Mr. Heath", which demands a tripartite television broadcast by yourself, Lynch and Faulkner following a meeting in London. 
The theme is "H.M.G. has firmly and rightly supported Mr. Faulkner ... but he cannot restore confidence on 
his own". You have in any case decided to return to London at once 
and the Press has been told this. This will hold the 
situation well enough, but you may be accosted by the Press in Plymouth - Who will not be politically sophisticated and who should therefore be approached with care. 
Above all, we 
have not attempted to destroy the impression that you have been kept in touch throughout with situation reports. I suggest therefore the following line:-

10th August 1971 You asked me on the telephone if we could let you 
have a note for the Prime Minister on the latest situation in Northern Ireland. I enclose a copy of the situation report prepared by the Army Department of the Ministry of Defence for the 24 hours ending at 8 o’clock this morning. With reference to the comments in paragraph 15 I should perhaps add that the Defence Secretary this morning authorised the dispatch of a further battalion (1 RRF) which will move to Northern Ireland during the next two days. This is in addition to the 2 Queens which has already arrived in Northern Ireland and 45 Commando which is now on the way: it will bring the total garrison to 17 units. The shortage of baton rounds is being investigated. 
The latest information from Belfast is that the 
situation in Northern Ireland this morning is quiet. If, as I understand, the Prime Minister is due to arrive at Plymouth tomorrow morning you may wish to consider whether it would be helpful if a later summary were telegraphed to him there through Service channels. 
I am copying this letter and enclosure to Graham 
Angel in case he has anything to add from the Home Office point of view.

1. FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF MESSAGE ISSUED AT 1800 HOURS TODAY ON BEHALF OF MR LYNCH. QUOTE THE GOVERNMENT TODAY REVIEWED THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE NORTH AND ASSESSED THE PROBABLE COURSE Or FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF OBVIOUSLY ONE-SIDED INTERNMENT IN THE NORTH IS A LAST DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO SUSTAIN THE STORMONT REGIME. THIS DECISION IS ALREADY SEEN TO HAVE BEEN FUTILE AND, EVEN WORSE, IT HAS BEEN A TRAGIC MISTAKE. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE NOW MUST BE TO BRING TO AN END THE APPALLING CARNAGE AND VIOLENCE IN THE NORTH WHICH IS THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE VISIT TO LONDON OF THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THIS IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE BOTH TO THE PEOPLE OF THE 26 COUNTIES AND THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH. UNQUOTE.

TO FLASH F C 0 TELEGRAM NUMBER 3 5 OF 9 AUGUST, INFO IMMEDIATE TO UKREP BELFAST, 
INTERNMENT FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF STATEMENT ISSUED ON BEHALF OF THE TAOISEACH 
THIS MORNING, 9 AUGUST. BEGINS THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL IN THE NORTH THIS MORNING IS DEPLORABLE EVIDENCE OF THE POLITICAL POVERTY OF THE POLICIES WHICH HAVE BEEN PURSUED THERE FOR SOME TIME AND WHICH I CONDEMNED PUBLICLY LAST WEEK. EVEN IF IT SUCCEEDS IN DAMPING DOWN THE CURRENT WAVE OF VIOLENCE 
IT DOES NOTHING TO FORWARD THE NECESSARY LONG TERM SOLUTIONS, THE SYMPATHIES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE 
IRISH PEOPLE NORTH ANS SOUTH GO TO THE NATIONALIST MINORITY IN THE NORTH WHO ARE AGAIN VICTIMISED BY AN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN A REGIME WHICH HAS LONG SINCE SHOWN ITSELF INCAPABLE OF JUST GOVERNMENT AND CONTEMPTUOUS OF THE NORMS OF THE BRITISH DEMOCRACY TO WHICH THEY PRETEND ALLEGIANCE. HARDSHIP WILL BE SUFFERED BY MANY FAMILIES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INTERNMENT AND I HAVE INSTRUCTED ARMY AUTHORITIES TO MAKE ACCOMMODATION AVAILABLE AT ARMY CAMPS TO ANY DEPENDANTS OF INTERNEES WHO SEEK SUCH ACCOMMODATION. IN THE PRESENT SITUATION IN THE NORTH IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT 
FURTHER PARADES BE NOW BANNED THERE AND THAT THE LAW BE ADMINISTERED IMPARTIALLY AND THAT A CONFERENCE OF ALL THE INTERESTED PARTIES TAKE PLACE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A NEW FORM OF ADMINISTRATION FOR

9 AUGUST 
1. MR FAULKNER, THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND, ANNOUNCED THIS MORNING, 9 AUGUST, THAT AFTER WEIGHING ALL THE RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING THE VIEWS OF THE SECURITY AUTHORITIES, AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, THE NORTHERN IRELAND COVERNENT HAD DECIDED TO ACTIVATE ITS POWERS OF INTERNMENT. THE SECURITY FORCES ARE ACCORDINGLY DETAINING PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERRORISM, AT THE SAME TIME A BAN ON ALL MARCHES AND PARADES WAS ANNOUNCED: THIS BAN, WHICH IS INITIALLY FOR-SIX MONTHS, COVERS A MAJOR PROTESTANT EVENT WHICH HAD BEEN DUE THIS WEEK, THE APPRENTICE BOYS’ MARCH IN LONDONDERRY. 
2. THIS DECISION HAS BEEN MADE IN THE LIGHT OF IRA ACTIVITY WHICH HAS INCREASED BOTH IN VOLUME AND IN THE VICIOUSNESS OF THE ATTACKS ON THE SECURITY FORCES AND SOCIETY IN NORTHERN IRELAND. IN ADDITION TO THOSE KILLED BY GUNMEN, EXPLOSIVES HAVE BEEN USED AGAINST POLICE STATIONS, AND ALSO BARS, AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES WHERE CASUALTIES AMONGST ORDINARY CITIZENS WERE INEVITABLE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED INCREASE IN THE WEIGHT AND QUANTITY OF EXPLOSIVES BEING USED, AND A CROWING NUMBER OF ATTACKS ON COMMERCIAL PREMISES IN BELFAST. THESE HAVE INCLUDED FOR THE FIRST TIME WELL-PLANNED OPERATIONS BY GANGS OF UP TO A DOZEN MEN, WHICH SHOWS THE GROWING CONFIDENCE -WITH WHICH THE IRA IS NOW OPERATING. ALL THE EVIDENCE INDICATES A DELIBERATE IRA POLICY TO DISTURB SOCIETY IN THE NORTH, DESTROY ECONOMIC LIFE AND DISCREDIT THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT, 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
3. ALL IMMEDIATE ADDRESSEES SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE FOREGOING IS AS APPROPRIATE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO WHICH THEY ARE ACCREDITED, AND THE REASONS BEHIND THE DECISION APPRECIATED. OTHER POSTS HAVE DISCRETION TO DO LIKEWISE. ALL SHOULD IN ADDITION ENSURE THAT.PRESS AND TV ARE FULLY BRIEFED.

TO IMMEDIATE F.C 0 TELEGRAM NUMBER 311 OF 10 AUGUST, INFO IMMEDIATE TO UKREP BELFAST. 1. MY TELS NOS 307 AND 308 REFELECT THE CENTRAL PUBLIC REACTIONS IN THE REPUBLIC TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE INTERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT. IRISH MINISTERS RECALLED FROM THEIR HOLIDAYS HAVE BEER MEETING THIS MORNING, AFTER WHAT, ONE HOPES, WILL PROVE TO HAVE BEEN THE WORST. NIGHT IN THE NORTH. THIS TELEGRAM IS MY ATTEMPT TO PICK OUT THE SALIENT POINTS IN A STILL VERY FLUID SITUATION AND FORECAST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE LIKELY TO HAPPEN. 2. MR LYNCH’ ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE IS VERY LIMITED. IF THE DAILY WERE RECALLED AND THERE WERE A DIVISION ON HIS POLICY TOWARDS THE NORTH AS HITHERTO FORMULATED, THE HARDL-LINERS IN FIANNA FAIL WOULD PROBABLY DEFECT AND HE WOULD BE DEFEATED. IF BY THE END OF OCTOBER INTERNMENT IS STILL IN FORCE WITH NO VISIBLE CHANGE IN THE LOT OF THE CATHOLICS, HE WILL BE HARD PUT TO IT TO SURVIVE. 3. HE HAS NOT BUDGED AN INCH FROM HIS PREVIOUSLY STATED VIEWS ON THE USE OF FORCE AND THE NECESSITY FOR PEACEFUL CHANGE IN THE NORTH. BUT THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT, AGAINST HIS ADVICE AND WITH THE APPARENT SHORT-TERM CONSEQUENCE OF UNITING ALL THE IRISH CATHOLICS NORTH AND SOUTH AGAINST US, FORCES HIM INTO A VERY TIGHT CORNER. IN THIS SITUATION IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT IN PUBLIC HE HAS NOT EXCLUDED THE POSSIBILITY OF INTERNMENT BECOMING NECESSARY IN THE SOUTH. 4. PRIVATELY, HE WOULD PROBABLY BE GLAD TO BE PROVED WRONG AND, WITH THE I R A LEADERS OUT OF THE WAY, SEE THE CATHOLIC MINORITY SETTLING DOWN TO A PEACEFUL LIFE IN THE NORTHERN COMMUNITY. 5. UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER NOBODY THAT I HAVE MET CAN SEE ANY REASON WHY THEY SHOULD, OR WHY THEY SHOULD PUT ANY FAITH IN MR FAULKNER’S WORD TO HIS ’’ CATHOLIC FELLOW COUNTRYMEN’’ IN HIS STATEMENT ON INTERNMENT. AND THE FACT OF INTERNMENT, TAKEN BY ITSELF, DOES NOTHING TO REMOVE THEIR SCEPTICISM. THE ATTITUDE OF THOUGHTFUL AND WELL DISPOSED IRISHMEN IS THAT INTERNMENT IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE ACT DESIGNED TO HELP EXECUTE A POLICY: AND THAT POLICY IS

1. BY THE TIME I SAW THE TAOISEACH STORMONT HAD ALREADY ANNOUNCED INTERNMENT, AND HE HAD ALREADY HALF DRAFTED A STATEMENT CALLING FOR 
A BAN ON PARADES. I TOOK HIM THROUGH THE PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE, FOR WHICH HE WAS GRATEFUL, AND I AM SURE HE WILL DO WHAT HE CAN WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLITICALLY POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE TEMPERATURE DOWN. 2. HE IS PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE, AND STILL MORE THE TEXT, SHOULD BE KEPT SECRET. YOUR TELEGRAM NO 155 MIGHT BE TAKEN TO SUGGEST THAT ITS HIGH SECURITY GRADING ONLY APPLIED UNTIL 11.15 A..M. BUT SINCE THE REFERENCE TO OUR NON- EXISTENT MEETING LAST WEEK WOULD CLEARLY BE DISASTROUS, I TOOK IT ON MY SELF TO GRADE THE MESSAGE SECRET AND PERSONAL. 3. HE WAS NATURALLY A LITTLE UPSET BY PARAGRAPH 7 AND HE FOUND ITS LAST SENTENCE A BIT ILLOGICAL. HE IS OF COURSE PLEASED BY PARAS 2 AND 3 OF THE MESSAGE, AND ATTACHES PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO PARA 8. 4. PLEASE SEE M.I.F.T.

IS GOING TO BE HEAVILY PRESSED TO SAY WHETHER HE WAS CONSULTED BEFORE THE DECISION WAS TAKEN, AND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY NO. (MY TELNO 290). 
(11) TIMING. HE WILL BE PRESSED TO SAY WHETHER HE KNEW IN ADVANCE AND IF SO 
WHEN. IT SEEMS IMPORTANT THAT ALL CONCERNED SHOULD STICK TO AN AGREED LINE. 
I SUGGEST THAT THIS SHOULD BE QUOTE YES, HM 
AMBASSADOR CONVEYED A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER ON THE MORNING OF 9 AUGUST INFORMING HIM OF THE DECISION UNQUOTE. 
(11) I AM NOT CLEAR WHY THE DEADLINE IS 9.30 AM RATHER THAN SAY 10.00 AM. 
IN THEORY EARLIER TIME COULD JUST MAKE IT POSSIBLE 
FOR MR LYNCH TO MAKE A LAST-MINUTE APPEAL FOR RECONSIDERATION. BALANCING THIS CONSIDERATION AGAINST COURTESY I WOULD BE SLIGHTLY IN FAVOUR OF THE LATER TIME, ALTHOUGH IT IS MOST LIKELY TO BE DECIDED BY THE GEOGRAPHY AND MECHANICS OF WHERE HE SEES ME.

6th August, 1971 I enclose two copies of a record of yesterday’s evening’s discussion 
with Mr. Faulkner. I am sending copies to Graham Angel and Philip Allen; to Johnny Graham and Stewart Crawford; and to Robert Andrew and the CGS. 
I should perhaps take this opportunity to put it on record that the 
Prime Minister told me after the meeting that, in the earlier private discussion which he and his colleagues had had with Mr. Faulkner, they had made it clear to the latter that, if internment failed, there could be no question of then moving on to e. g. reviving the B Specials or anything of that sort. The next step, and the only remaining step, would be direct rule.

this afternoon. 
The Home Secretary has been talking to Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner seems now to be firmly 
of the opinion that internment is desirable. He asked 
to come to see the Home Secretary to discuss this tomorrow, and the Home Secretary has now agreed that he should do so. 
The time provisionally fixed is 4 p.m. 
not intended that the visit should be announced in advance. 
It is No effort will be made to conceal it, and 
when questions are asked it will be said that this is a regular meeting to discuss the situation, such as takes place between the Home Secretary and Mr. Faulkner from time to time. 
There is an awkward problem of timing 
because of the debate on Northern Ireland to which the Lord President is to reply which is likely to begin at about 12.30 p.m. and will go on either until it collapses or until 5 p.m. 
The Lord President had thought that it might collapse at about 3 p.m. It would 
be difficult for the Lord President not to refer to the meeting in his speech. 
It is clearly desirable that 
you should have a talk with the Home Secretary, Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and Defence Secretary about the handling of Mr. Faulkner, and also that the Lord President should be there so that he has the necessary background knowledge for the debate. therefore arranged a meeting at 10.30 a.m. 
This will 
of course not leave you much time as you will need to start your Questions briefing at 11 a.m. or soon after. 
We have

MESSAGE TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND FROM THE HOME SECRETARY 
I said I would set out the position as clearly as I can. The decision whether to proceed to internment is yours to make under the 
Constitution but it is our mutual understanding, particularly in view of the involvement of UK forces, that such a decision would be agreed beforehand with us. You had yourself often said, and I have supported this view, that you would be guided by the recommendations of the security authorities. 
As I understand it the GOC is not in present circumstances recommending 
internment on military grounds. This of course is the basis on which he would advise Ministers of either Government who would be responsible for the decision. It would be for them to take into account the political considerations which are numerous and complex. 
I understand that pressure for internment is considerable and I agree that 
it may well become necessary. I have stated in public that we would raise no objection to internment if we were satisfied on the advice of the security authorities and after consultation with you on the wider aspects that this would help in the campaign against the IRA. I have further stressed that no prior announcement would be possible or desirable. This remains our position. 
We must look at the immediate situation against the background of the 
Apprentice Boys march on 12 August. If internment were introduced before then it would in our view be essential to proceed simultaneously with the indefinite banning of all political processions. I understand it is the GOC’s view on military grounds that he would not advise the banning of the procession. If the procession is to proceed it seems to me to be wiser to postpone any decision about internment until after it has taken place when we can review the situation again on the existing principles and wholly without prejudice to a decision either way. As so much attention has been paid to this march on 12 August its outcome one way or another will be of considerale significance for any decision about the future conduct of the campaign against the terrorists. 
This is the position as I see it. I should be most grateful for your comments. 
As I said, I would be very happy to see you if you would care to come and discuss it here but I rather share your view that the publicity attending such a visit would inevitably create a very difficult situation. 
4 August 1971

Before Ministers finally disperse we ought to be clear where we stand, 
particularly if the Home Secretary is to meet Mr. Faulkner later in the week. You will also need:(a) To obtain from the Cabinet delegated authority for yourself, the Home Secretary, the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence to take whatever action may be required by developments during the next few weeks. (But, if we move to direct rule, the Cabinet - ? and Parliament will presumably have to be summoned). (b) To inform the Cabinet that the Home Secretary will take charge of the Government, except in a very grave emergency, next week. (c) To decide how and when (b) should be made publicly known. 
In so far as internment will be a critical issue at the Home Secretary’s meeting with Mr. Faulkner, we need to weigh a number of factors - the 
2. 
reaction of the Irish Republic; the practical and political impact of internment in Northern Ireland (including the implications for the march on 12th August); and ways and means. Reaction of the Irish Republic 3. 
You will have seen Dublin telegrams Nos. 291 and 292, which make it 
clear that Mr. Lynch cannot afford to co-operate by introducing internment in the South and thinks it unlikely that a situation would arise when he would need it for his own purposes. He asks earnestly that there should be very serious reflection before the step is taken. 
In telegram No. 291 it is said that 
Mr. Lynch said he might be pressed to express his objections to internment. How far might these be pressed? Would he, for example, have to go to the length of raising the matter in the United Nations in order to preserve his own position ? 4. 
some advance warning. Note that the Dail is expected to rise on 6th August. 5. 
And, if we intern, we must be ready to move to direct rule at short 
notice thereafter. The necessary plans and arrangements for this purpose should therefore be completed. 
If the decision to intern is taken, it would seem right to give Mr. Lynch

The Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary had a 
discussion with the Prime Minister in his room at the House of Commons at 5.45 p.m. on Monday, 2 August about the possibility of introducing internment in Northern Ireland. The Home Secretary said that earlier in the day 
Mr. Faulkner had given the impression that, if he were to visit London later in the week, he might express the view that it was now desirable to introduce internment. He had implied that General Tuzo might now favour this. Later information had however suggested that Mr. Faulkner had not intended to imply this. The Defence Secretary 
confirmed, after consultation with the Chief of the that 
General Staff, that General Tuzo still felt/the introduction of internment would have, on balance, a harmful effect on the security situation in Northern Ireland. The Home Secretary said that he thought that a ban on the 
Derry March on 12 August would not be politically acceptable unless it was part of a package which also included internment. He had therefore concluded that a ban on the March should not be pursued further. In these circumstances he doubted whether there would be advantage in asking Mr. Faulkner to come to London for talks later in the week. 
The Prime Minister said that there will be an oppor- 
tunity to report the issues briefly to the Cabinet the following day. The Cabinet might be willing to leave the decision on internment and the ban to be settled by

TO IMMEDIATE HOME OFFICE TELNO 47 OF 31 AUGUST MY TELEGRAM NO. 46: PROPOSED STATEMENT ON TALKS (THOSE FOUR WORDS ARE UNDERLINED) 
1. THIS IS TO CONFIRM MY TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH WOODFIELD. SIR HAROLD BLACK HAS INFORMED ME THAT MR FAULKNER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE CLEARANCE TODAY. IN CONTRAST TO THE LINE MR FAULKNER TOOK WITH ME, WHEN HE PRESENTED THE DRAFT TO HIS COLLEAGUES HE TOLD THEM THAT HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER HAPPY THAT IT SUFFICIENTLY DEFINED THE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED TALKS (BLACK TOLD ME THAT THIS APPLIED PARTICULARLY TO THE QUESTION WHETHER DISCUSSION OF A COALITION GOVERNMENT WAS SATISFACTORILY EXCLUDED) AND MEMBERS OF THE CABINET DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED TIME TO CONSIDER THE DRAFT. 
WHEN I ASKED 
BLACK WHETHER I COULD EXPECT A REPLY TOMORROW, HE SAID IT HAD BEEN THE CABINET’S INTENTION TO CONTINUE THEIR DISCUSSION AT THEIR NEXT MEETING ON THURSDAY. AFTER CONSULTING WOODFIELD I TOLD BLACK THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE IN TOUCH WITH THE HOME SECRETARY THIS EVENING AND THAT UNTIL I RECEIVED FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS I COULD NOT EXPRESS A VIEW ON THE NEED FOR AN EARLY REPLY FROM MR FAULKNER. 2. IN MY TELNO 46 I EXPRESSED THE VIEW, WHICH IS OF COURSE A LOCAL ONE, THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR H M G TO MAKE A STATEMENT SOON. 
TO 
THIS I WOULD ADD THAT THE LONGER WE GIVE THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT TO DISCUSS THE DRAFT, THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO PICK HOLES IN IT. 
MR FAULKNER WILL, AS ALWAYS, BE SWUNG BY THE CURRENT 
AND WE SHALL THEN HAVE THE TASK OF TRYING TO GET HIM BACK ON COURSE AFTER CABINET DISCUSSION HERE HAS LED HIM TO SHOW SYMPATHY FOR POINTS RAISED BY HIS COLLEAGUES. IT IS FOR CONSIDERATION THEREFORE WHETHER HE NEEDS SOME MINISTERIAL STIFFENING OVER THE TELEPHONE. SMITH

PETER GREGSON We agreed to wait until after the meeting with 
Mr. Faulkner before sending a letter to Mr. Lynch on the lines attached to your minute of 17 August. I agree with you that such a letter is not now 
timely; but it is important to have the points in hand ready for my meeting with Mr. Lynch. I agree with points (i) and (iii) of your minute 
which have been embodied in the draft letter to Mr. Lynch. As far as (ii) is concerned, I still regard this as important. 
It seems to me that whoever drafted the 
memorandum attached comparing Northern Ireland with Eire fell over backwards in order to produce points favourable to Eire and hostile to Northern Ireland. 
For example: 
(a) In your memo the special position of the Roman Catholic church guaranteed by article 44(2) of the Constitution is not only abhorrent to Protestants in Northern Ireland but also frightens many of those who might otherwise have been more tolerant towards Eire. 
Moreover, it is religious discrimination 
in education in the South, just as in the North, which perpetuates the differentiation between the communities. 
(b) You state it a virtue that Members of Parliament are elected by proportional representation in Eire without at the same time stating that Mr. Lynch himself tried to abolish this but was defeated on a referendum. 
Nevertheless he now claims 
the right to institute proportional representation in Northern Ireland.

HE WAS OBVIOUSLY SHEEPISH AND DEFENSIVE ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE ARMY AND POLICE IN FACE OF A HOSTILE CROWD, AID TALKED ABOUT THE TENSI0N AND HOSTILITY IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA. THERE WAS NO POINT IN ARGUING IN HASTE AS WE BOTH NEEDED TO DISCUSS ANOTHER URGENT MATTER BEFORE HIS CABINET MEETING. 4.

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS ISSUED AT ABOUT 11.30 A.M. THIS hORNING BY THE GOVERNMENT INFORMATION BUREAU ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TAOISEACH. 
" DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS, THE BRITISH ARMY MADE SOME 30 INCURSIONS IN TO THE 26-COUNTIES. THESE WERE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES AT THE TIMES OF OCCURRENCE AND ASSURANCES WERE RECEIEVED THAT THEY WERE ACCIDENTAL AND THAT STRINGENT INSTRUCTIONS HAD BEEN RE-ISSUED TO THE BRITISH TROOPS TO AVOID SUCH INFRINGEMENTS. 
AT ABOUT 1.30 P.M. ON SUNDAY, 29TH AUGUST, A FURTHER INFRINGEMENT OCCURRED WHEN A BRITISH PATROL CONSITING OF TWO FERRET ARMOURED SCOUT-CARS PENETRATED ABOUT ONE MILE INTO THE 26-COUNTIES. ON, THEIR RETURN TOWARDS THE BORDER THEY WERE HALTED BY A MOTOR-VAN PARKED ACROSS THE ROAD. A CROWD GATHERED AND IMPEDED THEIR FURTHER PROGRESS. ONE SCOUT-CAR WAS SET ON FIRE AND THE CREW OF THAT CAR JOINED THE FIRST CAR WHICH WAS ALLOWED TO RETURN ACROSS THE BORDER APPARENTLY WITH ONE OR MORE PUNCTURED TYRES. 
ALL THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF A PARTY OF GARDA SIOCHANA AND AN ARMY PATROL. THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE GARDA SIOCHANA WHO TOOK CHARGE OF THE OPERATION WAS NOTIFIED AT 2.10 P.M. OF THE INCIDENT AND HE IMMEDIATELY HAD THE O/C. OF THE ARMY POST AT DUNDALK NOTIFIED. THE GARDA PARTY ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT 2.45 P.M SHORTLY AFTER THE GARDAI ARRIVED THEY HEARD GUNFIRE FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE BORDER. THE FIRING CONTINUED FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. SOON AFTERWARDS THE ARMY PATROL ARRIVED. FOLLOWING A LULL IN THE FIRING A HELICOPTER APPEARED AND FIRING RESUMED AND CONTINUED INTERMITTENTLY.FOR ABOUT 25 MINUTES. NEITHER ARMY NOR GARDA SIOCHANA PERSONNEL SAW AT ANY TIME ANY FIRING FROM THE 26-COUNTIES INTO THE 6-COUNTIES. 
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARMY PERSONNEL 
ALLOWED SUCH FIRING TO TAKE PLACE WITHOUT INTERVENTION BY THEM ARE ENTIRELY WITHOUT FOUNDATION.

31 August 1971 The Minister of State for Defence called on 
the Prime Minister at Chequers this afternoon to discuss the border incident at Crossmaglen and how we should react to the statement issued earlier in the day by the Government of the Irish Republic. The Prime Minister had before him the report on this incident from H.Q. Northern Ireland submitted under cover of Lord Balniel’s minute of 31 August. 
It was agreed:- 
(i) that the Ministry of Defence should issue as soon as possible their account of the incident, which could be based closely on the report from H.Q. Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister suggested that before this statement was issued it might be as well to check that the Commanding Officer of 14/20 H still took the view that the shots which killed a member of the Ferret crew came from south of the border; 
(ii) that the Foreign and Comonwealth Office should instruct our Ambassador in Dublin to inform the Government of the Irish Republic that the information available to us on the border incident differed substantially from their statement. 
The 
Ambassador should give the Irish Government an account of the facts as known to us; and

AND WOUNDED ANOTHER WERE FIRED FROM THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE BORDER 
LYNCH DENIES ALLEGATIONS IRISH PREMIER MR JACK LYNCH, CONTINUING HIS STATEMENT ON 
SUNDAY’S BORDER INCIDENT, SAID: ’NEITHER THE ARMY NOR GARDA SIOCAHANA PERSONNEL SAW AT ANY TIME ANY FIRING FROM THE 26 COUNTIES AND ALLEGATIONS THAT ARMY PERSONNEL ALLOWED SUCH FIRING TO TAKE PLACE WITHOUT INTERVENTION BY THEM ARE ENTIRELY WITHOUT FOUNDATION.’ 
MR LYNCH SAID ARMED CIVILIANS SEEN ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF 
BORDER WERE CHALLENGED BY SOUTHERN IRISH TROOPS BUT DISAPPEARED. PRESUMABLY RE-CROSSING BORDER TO NORTH.

PRIME MINISTER You will remember that Mr. Lynch wished to discuss a meeting with his colleagues. 
We have 
now heard that the Irish Ambassador wishes to call on Sir T. Brimelow tomorrow morning at 10.00 a.m. to discuss the agenda for such a meeting. 
Mr. Lynch 
apparently desires to be certain that there will be a useful outcome to the meeting before going firm on a date. 
Hence the desire to discuss the agenda. 
It would seem at this stage, and Peter Gregson agrees, that the thing to do at the meeting is for Brimelow simply to hear what the Ambassador has to say and undertake to report it back. The Home Secretary telephoned to let you know 
that he was back in the country and would be happy to see you to discuss Ireland should you wish to do so.

CONFIDENTIAL THE PROVISIONAL IRA IN DUBLIN HAVE PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BOMB OUTRAGE IN BELFAST ON WEDNESDAY LAST. LAST WEEK THERE WAS PUBLICITY SHOWING PROVISIONALS PUBLICLY FUND RAISING IN DUBLIN FOR VIOLENT ACTION IN THE NORTH. THE IRISH ARE THEREFORE VERY VULNERABLE ON THIS POINT. 
NIGHT I SUGGEST THAT THE IRISH AMBASSADOR SHOULD BE SENT 
FOR AND CONFRONTED WITH THESE FACTS? I DO NOT RECOMMEND PROPOSING TO H I M THAT THE IRISH GOVERNMENT SHOULD INTRODUCE INTERNMENT ON THE STRENGTH OF THIS EVIDENCE. 
INSTEAD WOULD YOU 
CONSIDER POINTING OUT TO HIM THAT UNLESS THE IRISH GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE PROVISIONALSN, (AND WHETHER BY INTERNMENT, NEW LEGISLATION, OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS IS THEIR AFFAIR) THEIR CREDIBILITY AND STANDING IN RELATION TO THE AFFAIRS OF THE NORTH ARE GREATLY IMPAIRED. 
THE IMPACT WOULD BE GREATER IF IT CAME FROM LONDON, AND 
IT WOULD INCREASE THE CHANCE OF CLEARING IT OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE THE PRIME MINISTERS MEET.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. FAULKNER AND 
PRIME MINISTER AT 10.00 a.m. ON SATURDAY, 28 AUGUST 1971 Exchanged greetings. 
PRIME MINISTERS PERSONAL MESSAGE 
MR. FAULKNER SERIAL Well, after our talk last night I had our Special 
Branch get the Attorney General’s Department in and we had another long discussion. I am afraid the end result does not take us any further. PRIME MINISTER I see. 
MR. FAULKNER They are satisfied that they have got nothing 
on which they could issue a warrant. If he landed here they would certainly lift him under the special powers but I gather that there is no hope of being able to use these outside Northern Ireland. PRIME MINISTER No, none at all. 
MR. FAULKNER No, it is unfortunate, but I am afraid that’s it. PRIME MINISTER In that case we shall have to send him back, and we 
had better get our people to co-ordinate the line they are taking with the press. MR. FAULKNER Yes, indeed. 
PRIME MINISTER It’s infuriating isn’t it. 
MR. FAULKNER Isn’t it infuriating.

MR. FAULKNER I have indeed, yes. 
PRIME MINISTER There are/two aspects of it. Politically I think really the 
nobody on either side will understand if be is just sent back. MR. FAULKNER I certainly agree with that. 
PRIME MINISTER Especially in view of this last week’s events. 
The real thing is how legally to deal with it. MR. FAULKNER Yes. 
PRIME MINISTER As far as I understand the situation, you have got a 
separate jurisdiction and so you would have to ask us for him with a warrant which we could then get executed. The problem which I find so difficult to understand is apparently to have grounds on which to issue one. It seems that to me with all the information we have had about what these people have been up to and he has been the Leader of it, it is very difficult to understand the Lawyer’s position but on the other hand it is quite true that one cannot do it on a flimsy reason.

27th August 1971 In your letter of 24th August to Nicholas Barrington you 
asked about possible retaliatory action against the Irish Republic in the field of immigration. As you asked for an early interim reply, this explanation of the possibility may be helpful. 
The problem is, in essence, one of how to prevent citizens 
of the Irish Republic entering the United Kingdom for employment. At present entry is on a substantial scale, and no control is exercised on travel within the Common Travel Area which is made up of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. This has been so, on a reciprocal basis, since 1962. But it is purely an administrative arrangement and Irish citizens are, in law, as much subject to the Commonwealth Immigrants Acts as are Commonwealth citizens. One indication of this is that Irish citizens may be recommended for deportation on conviction by a court, and they are in practice deported in substantial numbers. 
It follows that there is no reason in law why we should not 
apply the Commonwealth immigration control to Irish citizens at once. This would mean that they would be examined on entry by immigration officers and refused admission if the immigration officer was satisfied that they were coming to seek employment without an employment voucher. Bona fide visitors and students would have to be admitted unless medically unfit or having a criminal record or unless admission would in a particular case be contrary to the interests of national security. We would, however, need a substantial number of additional immigration officers to introduce this control. We have not calculated the number with any precision, but probably about 60 extra officers would be needed. This would be to cover the English, Scottish and Welsh ports having traffic with the Republic of Ireland. 
But a control instituted in this way would be far from 
water-tight. The Irish could cross the land border into Northern Ireland and then come to Great Britain. Control, even if it were practicable, over the land border could not be introduced simply by administrative action. It would require the making of an Order in Council under section 3(4) of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, and section 3(5) provides that a draft of any such Order in Council must first be laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House. But the making of

27 August, 1971 In your letter of 26 August you asked for an interim 
reply on the Prime Minister’s request that a study be put in hand on the range of actions open to us should we wish to retaliate against the Irish Government. 
The answers set out below reflect our tentative 
conclusions, some of which are based on first reactions and remain to be verified; some others reflect first drafts of papers and therefore have greater standing. 
Immigration I understand that the Home Office have replied to you 
on this direct, though I have not yet seen their letter. Our 
preliminary view was that, whatever might be done in the immediate future, the introduction of a common labour market when both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland join the Common Market would inevitably mean a return to something corresponding roughly to the present situation. 
Anglo-Irish Trade Much the same seems true here. 
Trade Area Agreement gives the Republic security of access duty free for virtually all its exports to the UK. 
The Anglo-Irish Free We are 
progressing towards comparable treatment for our exports by the progressive dismantlement of Irish duties. 
The Treaty contains 
no provision for termination, but if we simply announced we would not implement it (we are not yet sure whether we could do this without risking action in the International Court of Justice) we could hurt certain Irish exports - at a first estimate, 10 per cent of what she sends to us - and we could probably hurt Irish farmers through their sale of store cattle. 
However, 
amending legislation would have to be through by 31 December this year; without this the measure would have no subsequent significance even during the transition period after both countries joined the EEC on 1 January 1973, because the base rate

27 August 1971 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 20-26 AUGUST 1971 
Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL SITUATION 1. 
It has been a week when the possibilities of reconciliation 
between the leaders of the Northern Ireland communities seem to have become yet more remote. The parliamentary opposition rejected Mr. Faulkner’s proposal for a meeting and again turned to Mr. Lynch for support at a meeting in Dublin. More extreme Republican groups, led by the Brady IRA, continue to pursue separate plans for a nine-county 
parliament in opposition to the Social Democratic and our Party’s proposals. Roman Catholic 
owned premises in various towns in Northern Ireland have been shut down as a protest against Government policies and the Roman Catholic community seem now to be responding to the call to withhold rent. There continues to be little street activity but the incidence of explosions has been at least as high as before internment was introduced. 
2. In London the Government refused an official request from the 
Opposition to recall Parliament, although it was made clear that the possibility was being kept in mind. Mr. Wilson’s statement on 26th August about government policy in Northern Ireland seemed to call into question the continuance of a bi-partisan approach at Westminster. Mr. Heath met a delegation on 5th August led by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, which Opposition councillors had declined to join. 
SECURITY SITUATION 3. 
There have been about 20 reported explosions in Northern 
Ireland during the past week, of which all but three took place in Belfast. The most serious occurred on 25th August when about 201bs. of explosives detonated in occupied offices of the Electricity Board in South Belfast. One man was killed and 30 other people were taken to hospital, 16 of whom were detained. The incident led to widespread condemnation for its perpetrators, including messages from the Prime Minister, Mr. Faulkner and Cardinal Conway. It came at the end of a week of bomb explosions in Belfast which injured three people at a car showrooms on 20th August and two prison officers and two prisoners on 22nd August when a bomb exploded in the gateway of Belfast’s Crumlin Road Jail. Other targets included a Government office, a water board office, a college, a bar, a petrol station and a number of commercial premises. Elsewhere in Northern Ireland a telephone exchange was -1-

London S.W.1 27 August, 1971 
With your letter of 26 August you enclosed a telegram 
instructing HM Ambassador in Dublin to press Mr. Lynch to bring forward the date of their meeting. 
Mr. Lynch is out of Dublin, and his Private Secretary 
does not know his exact whereabouts. Sir John Peck might be able to establish communication by telephone, but this is at best doubtful and moreover hardly the way to conduct the sort of discussion that the Prime Minister’s message will involve. The Ambassador is reluctant to pursue Mr. Lynch by car, since he cannot move inconspicuously (he always has a Police escort) and the Press would very probably notice. Moreover the Ambassador considers it likely that Mr. Lynch would not give a firm reply until he had had an opportunity to discuss the idea with colleagues in Dublin, probably on Monday 
- which is not a Bank Holiday in Ireland. The Ambassador could of course act through the 
Department of Foreign Affairs, but again he feels this is a discussion he should handle himself, and not through a Duty Officer. 
He therefore proposes to act as soon as he can next 
week, when Mr. Lynch returns to Dublin. In our view this is right; there is always the possibility that Mr. Lynch may demur on the timing, and there is enough fevered speculation as it is in Ireland without causing more by a spectacular cross-country dash over the weekend. But I would be grateful for confirmation that this is acceptable.

Following your messages I have asked for an urgent 
study to be put in hand of the scope for retaliatory action against the Irish Republic covering, inter alia, trade and immigration. 
Meanwhile, I can confirm that the problem about 
immigration is mainly a practical one. It has always been felt that it would be both impractical and undesirable to maintain a close control over the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. It has also been thought undesirable to require U.K. citizens in Northern Ireland to obtain U.K. passports in order to travel to Britain. It thus follows that it is not possible to distinguish between citizens of Northern Ireland and the citizens of the Republic when they arrive at Heysham, Liverpool, etc. Once here however, Irish citizens are liable to deportation under the usual rules and if they then return and are found to have done so, they can be put in prison before being sent back yet again.

20th August 1971 I attach a draft statement for transmission 
to Mr. Faulkner which we think the Prime Minister will want to have submitted to him for approval before it is sent. 
special attention. 
There are two points to which I should draw First, the statement envisages 
talks with all sections of the Northern Ireland community. 
These would include Unionist backbenchers 
and dissident Unionists like Mr. Paisley and Mr. Craig, though they need not necessarily be brought in at the beginning. 
One of the primary objects is to get the 
Opposition in Stormont to return, but a formula which expressly excluded Unionist backbenchers and Craig and Paisley is likely to lead to agitation for their inclusion and as far as the Government supporters are concerned at any rate Mr. Faulkner would be bound to support them. 
talks might be held. 
Second, the statement is silent on where the This would depend partly on 
Mr. Faulkner’s wishes, and also partly perhaps on the extent to which there looks likely to be a favourable response to the initiative.

20th August, 1971 Barrington sent me a copy of his letter to you of 17th August about a 
comparison between the Northern Ireland reform programme and the position in analogous areas of law and administration in the Republic. 
In the draft passage which it is suggested might be considered for 
inclusion in a letter to Mr. Lynch the reference to the reform programme as being necessary simply to curb the ambitions of extreme Protestants is something of an over-simplification. 
"Mr. Faulkner’s courage in pressing through with reforms merits far greater recognition than it has been given. 
We would suggest that these words should 
be omitted and that in one or two other places the text should be simplified a little so that it would read as follows:- 
There is an unfortunate 
tendency in much of the comment from the Republic to assert that nothing has been done. 
He and his predecessor have in fact put through measures 
which neither you in Dublin nor we in Westminster have enacted, and although it can be argued that conditions were different in Northern Ireland, this does not detract from the achievement. 
It serves no useful purpose 
to elevate in public comment the Protestant extremists to an all-powerful role. 
They have not held this role while reforms were being enacted; 
they do not hold it now; and, as the Home Secretary’s statement of 10th August 1970 made plain, they will not be allowed to hold it in the future. 
who might otherwise have the courage to stand out for progress through policies of reform." 
In the table of comparisons the argument that there is no need for an 
Ombudsman in the Republic because there is extensive and effective intervention by elected representatives on behalf of their constituents might seem to imply that Great Britain M.Ps are not so diligent and therefore it was necessary to appoint a Parliamentary Commissioner. 
I am sending copies of this letter to Barrington, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Adnrew, Ministry of Defence and Cairncross, Cabinet Office. 
To suggest otherwise is merely to foster despair amongst those J. G. PILLING P. L. Gregson Esq.

If this was to be done however, the individuals concerned would have to be carefully chosen people who could distinguish between the sort of rough handling which was inevitable in a situation of this kind and deliberate and wanton brutality.

Draft Statement Political Progress can only be impeded so long as violence and 
intimidation continue; and the purpose of internment, and of the Army’s measures which are directed impartially at violence from whatever quarter, is to restore to Northern Ireland the necessary degree of stability for further political advance. The Border is not at issue. Nor is the constitutional position of 
Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. Mr.Faulkner has already given details of the major reform programme 
which is in course of being carried through. This programme, to which both the Northern Ireland Government and the United Kingdom Government are committed, together with increased opportunities for participation by representatives of the minority on the lines suggested in Mr.Faulkner’s recent initiative, have pointed the way forward. Once peace and order are restored, the Home Secretary, on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, has it in mind to arrange a meeting with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and representatives of both sides of the Northern Ireland Parliament; the purpose of these joint discussions will be to see whether it is possible, within this democratic framework, to devise further ways and means of giving representatives of the minority, as well as of the majority community in Northern Ireland, an active and permanent role in the processes of government and administration in the Province. In this way, further progress should be possible in creating a society in Northern Ireland acceptable to members of all communities.

MY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING TELEGRAM: FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF RE-DRAFT: 1. 
Political progress can only be impeded so long as 
violence and intimidation continue: and the purpose of internment, and of the army’s measures which are directed impartially at violence from whatever quarter, is to restore to Northern Ireland the necessary degree of stability for further political advance. 2. 
The border is not at issue. Nor is the constitutional 
position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. 3. 
Mr. Faulkner has already given details of the major reform 
programme which is in course of being carried through. This programme, to which both the Northern Ireland Government and the United Kingdom Government are committed, together with increased opportunities for participation by representatives of the minority on the lines suggested in Mr. Faulkner’s recent initiative, has pointed the way forward. The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary have today held a wide-ranging discussion with Mr. Faulkner, with particular emphasis on the implications of his speech of 22 June, and of the ref programme, for the greater participation of representatives of the minority in the processes of government and administration in the province. They are satisfied that conditions exist for real progress to be made. The debate which is to take place in the Northern Ireland parliament when it resumes after the recess will be of great importance to Northern Ireland and to the UK Parliament. It may well lead to proposals that will require legislation in Westminster amending the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It is therefore essential, in view of Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, that members from all sections of opinion

PRIME MINISTER At the weekend you were thinking of sending a letter 
to Mr. Lynch which would:- 
(i) remind him in detail of the substantial progress made in reform in Northern Ireland; 
(ii) underline this by making comparisons with the position in analogous areas of law and administration in the Irish Republic; 
(iii) tell Mr. Lynch that by his failure to recognise the progress and give credit for it to the Stormont Government he is merely strengthening the hand of the extremists and making it much more difficult to achieve the reconciliation towards which we are all 
supposed to be working. 
because of the need to do the point by point comparison with the Irish Republic which is now attached at Annex A. However now that the comparison has been made the view of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office is that not much can be made of this point. They argue as follows. Mr. Lynch is open to criticism for withholding credit due to Stormont for the measures of reform in recent years, but it is difficult to pin on the Republic the sort of charges which made the Reform Programme in Northern Ireland so necessary. Where the Republic does not follow Stormont in having legislation forbidding an abuse it is because, as in the U.K. , 
The draft has taken slightly longer than was expected that abuse is not 
practised. The "special position" of the Roman Catholic Church (guaranteed by Article 44(2) of the Constitution) 
is, to many both British and Irish a stultifying and anachronistic influence, but except in certain fields of education, there is no religious discrimination in any area of public life. Although the Protestant minority is only 5%, the first President of the Republic was a Protestant, and so is the present Minister of Health (and Deputy Prime Minister), Mr. Erskine Childers. All three political parties embrace all religious sects, and Members of Parliament are elected by Proportional Representation. It follows that using a tu quoque argument with Mr. lynch cannot be sustained and would not help.

Thank you for your letter of 13th August asking for a 
draft of a letter for the Prime Minister to send to Mr. Lynch. A draft is enclosed. There is no reference in the draft to the situation in 
the Republic. I understand that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have now prepared the comparative statement they were asked for on Northern Ireland and the Republic, and that this will reach you shortly; but that they will be advising that the material in it does not provide the basis for making useful comparisons in the letter to Mr. Lynch.

NORTHERN IRELAND 
After the meeting of the Cabinet on 16 August the Prime Minister, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Defence Secretary discussed certain specific matters. 
1. The Secretary of State for Defence said that in Londonderry a number 
of street barricades had been erected, not it was thought as part of the IRA operations, but mainly by discontented and hooligan elements in the Bogside. To take comprehensive direct action for the removal of the barricades would entail the use of a force of 3 to 4 battalions, and the advice he had received was that an operation of that kind would have unacceptable repercussions. The General Officer Commanding had a fresh plan that on Wednesday night 18 August the Army should mount an operation which involved drawing the hooligan element in the Bogside on to the streets; they would then be encircled by the Army, and as many of the hooligans as possible apprehended. It would then be possible gradually to demolish the barricades. The operation was approved. 
2. The Secretary of State for Defence reported that there had been some 
recent instances of television interviews with Army officers which had created the wrong impression. He proposed not to restrict the giving of interviews by officers on the ground, but required strict adherence to the instructions that had previously been issued to the effect that when dealing with questions officers should confine themselves to the incident about which they were being interviewed, and not allow themselves to be drawn into general comment. The Public Relations Officer on the staff of the United Kingdom Representative should take a hand in the mounting of any interviews by senior officers of the G.O.C.’s Headquarters.

17 August, 19 71 In your letter of 13 August you referred to the

MR. C. ROBERTS 
Thank you for the copy of your note for record with Mr. Wilson. When I mentioned this to the Chief Whip he thought that 
there would be great resentment among Members of both Parties - even hostility - if the House were recalled to discuss Northern Ireland when in fact any debate at Westminster could not influence events. Of course, if there were any sudden or dramatic change everyone would accept that it would be right to consider the situation again.

16 August 1971 
Dear Harold, Thank you for the message which you sent me 
this morning suggesting that Parliament might be recalled to debate Northern Ireland in a fortnight’s time. 
The recall of Parliament is of course something which we have had under careful consideration. 
I 
agree that in the present state of feeling immediate recall is not desirable. 
Nor is it easy to tell 
how the situation will develop over the next fortnight; and I have, as you know, arranged to have talks with Brian Faulkner later this week. 
But I can assure 
you that we will continue to keep the possibility of recalling Parliament closely in mind in the light of these and other developments. Yours sincerely, Edward Heath 
The Rt. Hon. Harold Wilson, O.B.E., F.R.S., M.P.

NOTE FOR RECORD Recall of Parliament to debate Northern Ireland 
Mr. Harold Wilson telephoned this morning about 
the recall of Parliament to debate Northern Ireland. He said that the Shadow Cabinet had concluded last week that it would not be right to recall Parliament immediately, but that they would review the situation again over the weekend. 
and Mr. Houghton, and hoped to have a word later in the day with Mr. Mellish. 
the present situation in Northern Ireland, it would not be right to defer Parliamentary debate until 18 October. Mr. Wilson said that he therefore wished to 
suggest - without at this stage making a formal "hard" 
request - that Parliament should be recalled in a fortnight’s time. 
The delay of a fortnight would 
give time for tempers to cool, while an early announcement that Parliament would be recalled would give those M.Ps. who were particularly worried about the situation something to look forward to. 
The 
delay would also enable many M.Ps. who were at present away to complete their holidays; and Mr. Callaghan was expecting to be away for a few days next week. Mr. Wilson suggested that there should be a 
two-day debate on Northern Ireland, either on 31 August and 1 September or on 1 and 2 September. 
The 
Opposition Front Bench had no plans to divide the House. 
Mr. Wilson did not at this stage propose Their view was that, in He had spoken to Mr. Callaghan

Extract from THE WORLD AT ONE Philip Whitfield/ord-Chalfont 
TRANSMISSION: 30th August 1971 CHALFOnT: 
As a result of the policy of detention and 
presumably internment will follow, the IRA, the groups, units, in the Belfast area have been badly broken up, and many of them have had to go into the Republic of Ireland where of course they are given complete freedom by the authorities down there, to operate, to train, and to move about arms and gelignite, and therefore one is very likely to have an increasing number of incidents along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. We had an incident last night at Clogher on the Tyrone/Monaghan border, and we had one at Koleen, near Newry, and of course we had this dastardly murder by IRA groups based in the Republic of Ireland near Corfmaglen. 
WHITFIELD: Yes, well given the nature of the border with 
minor roads criss-crossing backwards and forwards over it, surely it was inevitable that the army would inadvertently stray into the Republic, as they did at Corfmaglen? 
CHALFONT: Yes. Unfortunately this will happen with the 
army, I suspect, from time to time, because unlike the previous occasion of 1956/60 when the Ulster Special Constabulary were responsible for security along the order, there were 
who used every lane 
and every road and every river, and they knew exactly when they wore in Northern Ireland and when they weren’t. 
WHITFIELD: The physical nature of the border makes it 
very difficult to patrol. I mean surely from Derry to Newry it’s wild moorland, and then you’ve got situations like in the village of .. whore the border itself runs through a man’s bedroom. How on earth can those be controlled? 
CHALFONT: Well, I’m not suggesting they patrol men’s 
bedrooms, but what I am saying is that if we had the manpower, and there were men with local knowledge, w could once again show that this border could be patrolled much more effectively than at present. 
WHITFIELD: You would presumably blow up unapproved roads, 
would you, as you did in the fifties? CHALFONT 
Yes, you have two alternatives. You can put 
spikes into the road, but they’re reasonably ineffective because they can be pulled out. The alternative is to blow up river bridges and culverts, and this was done in 1956 and proved quite effective at that time. There are about 150 roads which cross the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and if the Southern Irish authorities fail to take any initiative to clamp down on the IRA activities in the South of Ireland, then I would have thought it must be necessary for we in Northern Ireland

EXTRACT FROM "THE WORLD AT ONE" Bob Williams/Lord Chalfont on the Irish Border Incident. 
TRANSMISSION: 30th August, 1971. 
CHALFONT: operation. 
- No, I don’t think this is really a feasible military The sealing of the border would mean the deployment of large 
numbers of troops. There are something like 120 unapproved roads crossing the frontier and 300 miles of border which can be crossed, even where there are no roads. My own calculation is that it would need something like the equivalent of another ten battalions of infantry to make the operation successful. You see what we’re faced withhere is a border problem similar in scale to the border problem between East and Wst Germany in Europe, and in order to effectively to seal that border we’ve seen what the Russians have had to do, machine gun posts, mines, barbed wire - this is the kind of thing that we’re talking about when we talk of sealing the border, I don’t think. quite honestly it makes military sense. 
WILLIAMS: But Mr. Taylor obviously think it makes political 
sense certainly, but he’s drawn attention to the fact that at the moment there’s not enough personnel to do this. He suggests a third force be recruited, how do you react to that? 
CHALFONT: Well I’m not quite sure what he had in mind by a 
"third force", I imagine that he has in the back of his mind something like the resuscitation of the B Specials. Whatever he has in mind, I think the idea of a third force is a very dangerous one. We have the British Army which, as he pointed out quite rightly is used in what I believe are now called urban guerilla operations, that is to say internal security in the towns, and then we have the UDR. Now the point that he didn’t make about the UDR is that it already has an authorised strength of 6,000 which would make quite a useful border patrol force, but there are only 4,000 recruits in it at the moment, so all we need first of all is to recruit that force up to strength and then I think there’ll be no need to start talking about a third force which would be military and politically very dangerous. 
WILLIAMS: Well in view of the intimidation going on against 
people joining..some people joining the UDR, and given the situation on the borders, surely something must be done to stop these kind of incidents, to stop the IRA coming across. 
CHALFONT: 
One of the things I think that ought to be done, and I know that the military have this in mind, is that there ought to be some way of signifying roughly where the border is. 
Yes, I think something ought to be done. You can paint trees, fences, you can make.. 
you can give a general idea along the whole length of the border as to where roughly the border is, you then make it quite clear to your own troops that they mustn’t cross that line, and you make it quite clear to any terrorists on the other side that if they do so it will be at their own risk. 
WILLIAMS: Eire Government is being irresponsible over the border issue at the moment? Do you accept what John Taylor implies that the

PRIME MINISTER This is the Home Office advice on the suggestion you 
made at Chequers: The suggestion which the Prime Minister raised at the 
meeting at Chequers yesterday that there might be a quick inquiry into allegations of brutality in Northern Ireland undertaken by a lawyer and a doctor has been further pursued with the GOC and Mr. Faulkner. 
The GOC would warmly welcome an inquiry of this kind; 
Mr. Faulkner also thinks it could be useful and agrees that the RUC should be included. 
The proposed terms of reference are:"To investigate the evidence relevant to the allegations 
made by, or on behalf of, those arrested under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 on 9 August about their treatment while in the custody of the Security Forces prior to either their subsequent release, the serving of a detention order or the preferring of a criminal charge." The Ministry of Defence would like it to be said that 
this inquiry was being undertaken at the request of the GOC ANd the formula which might be used could be: "The GOC Northern Ireland, in his capacity as Director of Operations (this brings in the RUC), with the full concurrence of the Northern Ireland Government, has requested, etc." A statement giving the terms of reference will give rise 
to immediate pressure for the names, but it seems better, particularly in the light of press reporting in the course of today, to get a holding statement out as soon as possible, perhaps in time for the Sunday press rather than wait until persons have been found willing and suitable to serve. Presumably the statement should be issued by the Minister 
of Defence. Lord Balniel agrees at all points. Do you agree the action proposed?

20th August 1971 Mr 
Old Hall, Brampton, Becles, Suffolk. 
ier, M.P,, 
Dear Mr. Prior, I have continued to do what I can to emphasize to Mr. Lynch 
the goodwill of Mr. Heath and his colleagues. If I may, however, there are one or two points which I feel I should make. 
Mr. Lynch is very much a man of peace and has, as you know, 
kept to this policy under, at times, very difficult conditions. There would appear to be some feeling in Britain that it might have been possible for him to introduce internment in the South. It is not, I think, fully realised, just how strong a shift in public opinion is taking place in the South. Far from taking steps against Northern republicans he is instead in a situation where any aid or assistance to them would be widely welcomed in the South. There is a very definite tide flowing, the strength of which it would be easy to underestimate. This tide is in favour of aid to the Nationalists in the North. 
At one time it would have been fair to say that the over- 
whelming weight of opinion in the South was against any form of serious support for the Nationalists or Republicans in the North. Among the older section of the population this may still, to some extent, be the case, but not among the general populace. 
Such currents of opinion, once under way, are very difficult 
to reverse. I cannot help feeling that the very real dangers of a Protestant backlash in the North have been allowed to obscure the far greater danger of a Catholic or Nationalist reaction both North and South. There is, in my opinion, a very real danger that affairs in Ulster will gradually slide, against the wishes of

THIS HAD ITS ADVANTAGES AS MCCANN BECAME STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF THE EARLIER MEETING AND VERY MUCH HAS THE TAOISEACH’S EAR. HE CLEARLY DID NOT WANT ME AROUND WHILE HE TELEPHONEDN BUT CALLED ME SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WITH THE REPLY. MCCANN’S REACTIONS BEFORE CALLING MR LYNCH ARE SIGNIFICANT. 
HE WAS PREDICTABLY STARTLED AT THE CONCLUDING WORDS OF

PRESUMBLY IT MEANT WHAT 
IT SAID. MRLYNCH WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS BEING PRESSED TO PURSUE LINES THAT WOULD BE NEITHER WISE NOR HELPFUL, WHICH WAS AN ADDED ARGUMENT FOR AN EARLY MEETING. 
MCCANN WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT IT SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR 
THAT THE INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE THE MEETING CAME FROM OUR SIDE. HE REALISED THAT OUR VARIOUS MESSAGES WERE EXPLICIT ON THIS POINT, BUT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR MR LYNCH IF IT WERE PRESENTED PUBLICLY AS A MOVE BY HIM FORCED UPON HIM BY POLITICAL PRESSURES AT HOME. PARAS 2 AND 3 OF YOUR TEL NO 180 SEEM TO LEAVE NO ROOM FOR DOUBT BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WHEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS MADE IT SHOULD BE ON THESE LINESM 
BUT MACCANN’S MAIN POINT WAS TO UNDERLINE THE RISK THAT MR LYNCH WAS RUNNING IN COMING TO THIS MEETING, AND THAT RETURNED VISIBLY EMPTY HANDED HE WAS FINISHED. HE REPEATED 
IF HE THAT 
HE WAS NOT COMING TO TALK ABOUT REUNIFICATION BUT ABOUT ’POSITIVE MEASURES TO RESTORE PEACE AND JUSTICE IN THE NORTH’.
