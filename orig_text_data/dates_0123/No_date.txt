NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION - TEMPORARY DEPLOYMENTS FROM BFG 
Reference: A. TLM 080855Z Oct 71/COS 07. 1. 
The planned relief programme for Northern Ireland includes 
the temporary redeployment of 1WG from BAOR on a 4 month emergency tour starting on 21 Jun 72. Although this represents an addition of one major unit deployed from BAOR to Northern Ireland, in fact there will be no change to the total number of major units temporarily deployed from BAOR, due to the return to BAOR of 1 R IRISH from UNFICYP 1 to 10 May 72 (Reference A). 2. 
under existing contingency plans. This does not apply to 1 R IRISH whilst in Cyprus. Therefore on present planning the situation in BAOR after the move of 1 WG is an improvement over the present position. 3. 
Because of the serious overstretch of RAF Regiment squadrons 
based in the UK, it has been found necessary to temporarily redeploy No 1 Squadron, RAF Regiment at RAF Laarbruch to Northern Ireland for 
3 months starting on 20 May 1972. Its present role is to provide The speedy return of 1 WG to BAOR in a time of tension is covered

FROM: APS/S of S TO: 
No 10 (Lord Bridges) In your letter to Bill Mumford of 20 September you 
mentioned that the Prime Minister, in approving the proposal not to replace two Army units which are due to leave Northern Ireland in October and November, had added the comment that the reduction should be so planned that the withdrawal of troops from Catholic and Protestant areas should be balanced. I confirm at this will be the case. 
Both these first stage 
reductions will be made in Belfast, but there is of course no question of leaving any area completely uncovered: as is always necessary when a reduction takes place, unit boundaries and deployments will be adjusted and this will be done in such a way that the coverage of Catholic and Protestant areas will be in approximately the same proportions as at present. 2. 
It has been decided, in consultation with the Secretary 
of State for Northern Ireland, that the units affected by the decision should be informed [ tomorrow ] [this] afternoon. 3. 
I am sending copies of this letter to [ the Private 
Secretaries to the other members of GEN 79] and to Brian Webster.

DEFENSIVE BRIEF FORCE LEVEL REDUCTIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
Background 1. 
Instructions have been issued to the following units that 
they will not be required to carry out their forthcoming planned tour of 4 months in Northern Ireland. 
From UKLF From BAOR 
2. 3. 
7 Para RHA due to move there at the end of October 32 Engr Regt due to move at the end of November 
As the result of these changes the force level of major units 
in the infantry role will be reduced from 18 to 16 by the end of November. 
There will be no formal announcement in the press about these 
changes and any speculation will be countered with the normal PR line that we do not comment on force levels or deployment. 
However, the 
receipt of the information by the families in these units will soon become public knowledge. 
4. This defensive brief has been prepared against questions but the 
information will not be volunteered. The line to be taken Q.1. 
A.1. current situations. 
Are Army force levels in NI being reduced? Yes. 
It has always been HMG policy to adjust force levels to The last significant redeployment was 
March 1973, since when the general level of violence has declined, especially in Belfast, and the pattern of troubles has changed. This allows us to reduce the number of Army units we provide to support the RUC in maintaining law and order. Normal rotation of units over the next six weeks makes this an appropriate and timely opportunity to implement redeployments (provided no change in the situation meanwhile). 
Q.2. A.2. 
Where? When? And how much? 
a. The Belfast area particularly with only minor effects elsewhere as a consequence. 
b. Between mid October and early December. 
c. By 2 units, leaving 16 units out of the present 18 in the infantry role. (by 1000 men leaving 15,500 out of the present 16,500.]

This defensive brief has been prepared against questions but the information will not be volunteered. 
5) 
The line to be taken Q1. Why has this reduction in the number of units been agreed? A1. It has always been HMG policy to adjust the force level to meet the needs of the current situation. It is considered that 16 units in the infantry role will be sufficient to support the RUC in maintaining law and order. 
Q2. Will the units which are due for relief by 7 Para RHA and 32 Engr Regt complete their current tour of 4 months or can they be relieved earlier? 
A2. No. The units now serving in Northern Ireland on emergency tours will complete their 4 months. This will allow time for redeployment to cover the gaps created by the reduction in the force level during October and November.

INTER-PARTY TALKS ON THE HOUSE OF LORDS REFORM 1967-68 
The basis for the inter-Party consultations on reform of the House of 
Lords was set out in the then Prime Minister’s letters of 30th October 1967 to Mr. Heath and Mr. Thorpe. 
"On one point - the composition of the negotiating team you will wish to know our proposals now: following the precedent of the 1948 Conference, we propose that the Ministerial team should be five in number (Lord Chancellor, Lord President, Home Secretary, Leader of the House of Lords, and Minister without Portfolio (Lord Shackleton)), and that the Conservative team should be four in number and the Liberal team two. 
In addition to the five 
Ministerial negotiators I propose to attend next week’s opening meeting myself; and if you decide not to lead your team of four you also may care to attend the opening Session on the same basis". 
All the Parties’ negotiators were Privy Councillors - with the sole 
exception of Lord Byers. At the first meeting of the Inter-Party Conference on 8th November 1967, 
the then Prime Minister proposed that:- 
"...following the precedent of the 1910 and 1948 Conferences, the inter-Party discussions should be entirely confidential; that proposals might be put forward in the discussions without prejudice to subsequent proposals which they might subsequently, either jointly or severally, wish to put forward; and that any papers which were circulated would be strictly confined to the Party representatives attending the discussions". 
Mr. Heath and Mr. Thorpe agreed with this approach, but both reserved their freedom to consult their Party colleagues in confidence. 
They included the following passage:Apart from press 
guidance about this first meeting, it was agreed that no publicity would be given to subsequent meetings, nor any indication of the subjects discussed.

No one can doubt the intensity and sincerity 
of the efforts made by the British Government since direct rule to achieve a reconciliation of the communities of Northern Ireland. Equally, no one can doubt, after the declared 
ferocity of the IRA’s renewed attacks on the civil population, that they will stop at nothing in their efforts to terrorise the Government and the population. In these circumstances H.M.G. has no option but 
to take the most severe measures against the IRA, and particularly those in it directing these atrocities.

STATEMENT BY THE RT HON DR G B NEWE 
I have accepted the Prime Minister’s invitation to come into the Government as Minister of State at the Department of the Prime Minister. 
I am not a member of any political Party nor do I envisage any such involvement in the future. 
Much better known is the fact that, for most of my life, I have been, and am, a Community Social Worker, and as such, I have given service to all the people of Northern Ireland, whatever their religious or political views. 
I would like to think that my service in the Cabinet may be seen as a continuation of that community service - by the existing constitutional rules. 
although it is limited to six months 
Naturally, I am conscious of the symbolism of an action by which, for the first time, a member of the half-million strong Catholic community comes into a Northern Irish Government. 
All who know me need no assurance that it is not 
a step I have taken lightly, or without satisfying myself that it is intended to be very much more than a token or symbol. 
I recognise that I have no mandate from anybody, and certainly will not claim to speak for the Catholic community. 
Most certainly, most emphatically, I do not wish, in any way, to put myself in the place of elected Members of Parliament. 
If I have a specific cause or policy to advance it is one which I have sought to work for all my life. It is a cause which most of my fellow-citizens, as well as my fellow members of the Government, will support and work for. And that, purely and simply, is the improvement of the quality of life for all in Northern Ireland.

HOME SECRETARY FCS:/71/79 
Northern Ireland 1. 2. I saw Hugh McCann (PUS Ten in Rome. He told me that he must impress on me that unless there was 
soon a change in the situation in Northern Ireland every moderate politician in Southern Ireland would be swept away and their Parliament would become violently hostile to the UK. 
3. he said that he had been Ambassador in London for so long that 
he well understood how much we detested the prospect of direct rule. I asked him what then he would propose short of that. 4. 
He replied that it was really hopeless to try and prop up the 
present Government at Stormont. Could we not put government there into commission for some years and introduce a pattern which would provide for proper representation of the minority throughout the administration and in the government, and supervise it until it got going, particularly internal security. 5. 
- Dublin) at the meeting of the I reminded him that this would mean acting for the minority against 
the wishes of the majority. He admitted that but asked how else the minority could ever feel that they would get a fair deal when they could never through the vote get control. He repeated most earnestly that very soon indeed the situation 
would get out of the control of moderate and reasonable Irishmen. I was impressed by his sincerity. 7. 
I am sending copies of this minute to the Prime Minister and the Defence Secretary. (ALEC DOUGLAS-HOME)

DRAFT STATEMENT BY THE HOME SECRETARY I welcome the publication by the Government of Northern Ireland of 
their consultative document on the future development of the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland. In pursuing the discussions on this subject, which I was invited by 
Mr. Faulkner to chair, I have now heard the views of the T.U.C., the Labour Party, 
Party and others. the New Ulster Movement, the Alliance Party, the Liberal The Northern Ireland Government have now published 
this outline of their views on the subjects for discussion under my chairmanship. I formally ask the S.D.L.P. and the Nationalist Party representatives 
to come now and discuss with me their ideas on the future development of Parliament and Government. 
The statement issued announcing my talks 
described their objective as finding, by agreement, an active permanent and guaranteed place for both communities in the life and public affairs of Northern Ireland. 
The word "guaranteed" implies that H.M. Government 
in the U.K., as a participant in the talks, will carry their proper responsibility for guaranteeing any agreed solution. 
None but a handful of 
fanatics in Northern Ireland can now wish for anything but such an agreed solution. 
can only come by discussion. The alternative to agreement is continuing struggle. Agreement

MEMORANDUM ON THE SITUATION IN IRELAND 
Rights movement in 1969 opened the eyes of the British public to the condition of Ulster during the last 50 years, successive British governments have approached its problems on the following basis:- 
Ever since the eruption into violence of the Civil 
(i) The constitutional position of Ulster as part of the UK is not to be changed 
(ii) The Border (Partition) is not in dispute. 
(iii) Points (i) and (ii) stand until Stormont decides otherwise (i.e. votes for re-unification). 
(iv) A programme of reform must right the wrongs suffered by the Catholic minorities in Ulster. 
(v) Catholic political and public figures must be enabled and encouraged to play a full role in the public life of Ulster. 
(vi) In the face of violence from whatever quarter law and order have to be restored, even at the cost of a massive deployment of the British Army and the introduction of internment without trial. 
(vii) Finally the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic has been brought into consultation on Northern Ireland affairs, first bilaterally with Mr. Heath and then with Mr. Faulkner also participating. 
2. The position of the only other sovereign state involved, namely the Republic of Ireland, upon these issues is, at the time of writing, as follows:- 
(i) and (ii) 
Prime Minister believes that reunification will inevitably come 
Inacceptable in principle; the present about, peacefully and gradually. 
He is beginning to lose support for this "peaceful approach as the Northern situation deteriorates. 
(iii) Universally regarded as a fraud to perpetuate partition.

"Arrest policy after the ceasefire should be as follows: (i) In respect of offences under the criminal law, including specific offences under the Special Powers Act and regulations made thereunder, where the offence is alleged to have been committed after these instructions take effect, the due processes of the law will apply, including those under the Special Powers Act. 
(ii) In respect of offences under the criminal law, including specific offences under the Special Powers Act and regulations made thereunder, where the offence is alleged to have been committed before these instructions take effect, a person wanted for such an offence or unlawfully at large will be arrested if he is recognised and if there is a legal power to arrest him in the circumstances. In regard to matters arising before the ceasefire, persons may, if recognised, be arrested for the purpose of questioning leading to the preferment of charges, but not for purposes leading to internment."

SECURITY FORCES ACTIONS TO A CEASEFIRE Introduction 1. 
The possibility exists that the Provisional IRA say either announce a 
ceasefire or simply allow one to come about. In either event a quick response from the Security Forces may be called for and our possible reactions should be examined, 
2. The aim of this short paper is to suggest the principles to be adopted 
by the Security Forces in the event of a ceasefire. Assumptions 3. 
The following assumptions are made: 
(a) There will be an immediate political requirement to demonstrate a still greater reduction of military activity, particularly in Catholic areas. 
(b) An IRA ceasefire is likely to be obeyed by the membership. There might however be individual acts of violence. 
(c) Hooliganism and possibly otuer sectarian demonstrations may continue In the initial stages at least, but on a reduced scale. 
(d) It will remain the role of the Security Forces to restore and maintain law and order, but more emphasis Pill devolve on the latter (see para. 8). 
After the initial ceasefire, decisions on the following subjects may 
be necessary: (a) Release of remaining internees. (b) Surrender of weapons. (c) The banning of all parades in uniform (IRA and UDA). (d) Reinstatement of civil police action. (e) Withdrawal to barracks". (f) Use of the Special Powers Act.

3. 
In respect of offences under the criminal law, where the offence is alleged to have been committed before these instructions take effect, a person wanted for such an offence or unlawfully at large will be arrested if he is recognised and there is a legal power to arrest him in the circumstances.

THE ROYAL ULSTER CONSTABULARY 
Instruction on the Treatment of Prisoners Code Regulation 
1380 
Prisoners in police custody are to be treated with the most humane consideration which their situation and safety will allow, and no harshness or unnecessary restraint is to be used towards them. On the other hand, as the escape of a prisoner may result in very serious consequences for the persons in charge of him, the utmost vigilance should be exercised to ensure that a prisoner does not escape while in police custody. 
Discipline Regulations 
629 8) 
c) Any member commits an offence against discipline if he is guilty of: 
unlawful or unnecessary exercise of authority, that is to say, if he: 
uses any unnecessary violence or harshness to any prisoner or other person with whom he may be brought into contact in the execution of his duty or knowingly allows such violence or harshness to be used. 
This subject is also dealt with in The Royal Ulster Constabulary Manual of Instruction, which is issued for the guidance of all members of the Force, in somewhat similar terms as follows:- 
Prisoners in police custody are to be treated with the utmost humane consideration which their situation and safety will allow and no harshness or unnecessary restraint is to be used towards them. On the other hand, as the escape of a prisoner may result in very serious consequences for the persons in charge of him, the utmost vigilance should be exercised to ensure that a prisoner does not escape while in police custody. 
A new edition of the Manual is in the process of distribution to the Force at the present time.

D J Trevelyan Esq Northern Ireland Office London 
Thank you for your letter of 9 June about the "wanted" list and the arrest and prosecution of IRA leaders from the South. These were discussed at JSC(0) last week, and no doubt you 
will have seen the minutes; paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 refer. (The particular arrests on 5 June had been discussed the week before, when we drew the Army’s attention to the embarrassment which could be caused by their emphasising the standing of IRA figures whom they arrested.) Both the Army and the RUC took the view that their instructions to personnel should ensure that only the more important terrorists, or those who were likely to be charged, were arrested; they also considered, however, that it was right to maintain a full list of suspects, not as "wanted" people but in case the information should be required at any time or in any particular area. 
The Committee accepted that this was reasonable, and I do not think that we can press the point any further for the time being. As to the arrest of IRA leaders from the Republic, we did pass your message 
of 2 June to the Chief Constable the same day. But at JSC(O) the RUC representatives took the view that there was very little prospect of gathering evidence against these men which would be likely to satisfy the courts, and as you say the use of Regulation 10 and 11 in these cases presents obvious difficulties.

It has been suggested that members of the IRA arrested in Northern 
Ireland might, if no charges could be brought against them there, be handed over to the authorities in the Republic. 
To do this without powers would be unlawful. The obvious powers for making such a transfer exist in the 
arrangements for extradition between the United Kingdom and the Republic. 2. 
These arrangements are that the police in either country may obtain a 
warrant for the arrest of a person wanted for a criminal offence and send it to the police in the other country to execute. has to be brought before a court in that country. 
If the person is arrested he The court decides whether 
the person should be surrendered to the other country, and before doing so has to be satisfied that the offence of which he is suspected is one for which he may be surrendered and is not an offence of a political nature. 
Under United 
Kingdom law a person may be surrendered only if the offence of which he is wanted is indictable or punishable on summary conviction with imprisonment for six months or more. 3. 
Thus, in the circumstances under discussion, if a person arrested in 
Northern Ireland was wanted for an offence in the Republic, it would be up to the authorities there (i.e. the Garda) to consider applying for a warrant and sending it to the RUC for execution. 
The most that could be done if it 
were thought desirable to surrender such an arrested person to the Republic would be to let it be known there that he was in custody and enquire whether any warrant for his return would be forthcoming. 4. 
The question would,of course, be highly political in the Republic, and 
there might well be a desire by the authorities there to avoid any action which smacked of collusion with the United Kingdom against Republican elements. 5. 
There would also be political, and possibly legal considerations, for us. 
If the person had been arrested for anything other than a criminal offence (e.g. under Regulations 10 or 11 of the Special Powers Act), the propriety of his being made subject to a warrant applied for in the Republic might be open

THE AIMS OF THE IRA Background As a military organisation, the IRA is committed to "capturing" 
Northern Ireland from the British and overthrowing the governments in Belfast and Dublin. The stated objectives of its political wing, Sinn Fein, are "to break the connexion with England; to end the British Imperial system in Ireland; to end poverty and insecurity; to abolish the existing Partition institutions of government in Ireland and to replace them by a National Government having complete and effective jurisdiction over the entire territory of the Nation". But these are general aims. By the mid-1960s the IRA-Sinn Fein movement was militarily and financially bankrupt, unable to defeat the security forces in the North and disorganised in the Republic by the actions of the Dublin Government. It recognised that it needed a more specific platform and that it could not continue to operate on an almost exclusively military basis. In trying to transform itself from an organisation which called for popular support in its own battle into one which purported to help the people in what it regarded as their battle against social injustice, the leaders turned increasingly to their own Marxist tradition. Thus a new generation of Marxists and Communists, such as Roy Johnston and Antony Coughlan, associated themselves with a movement in which the pro-Communists Cathal Goulding and Tomas McGiolla were already in leading positions. Even Rory Brady, who broke away in 1970 to form the Provisional Council of the IRA, admitted that he and his supporters had found many of these political aims acceptable. The professed aims of the Official and Provisional wings of the IRA are therefore in many respects still similar, despite their arguments over ways and means. 
By the 1960s, however, the IRA was both a discredited and an 
illegal organisation, and Sinn Fein, although a legal party, was also discredited. The leaders of the movement therefore supported the formation in the South of a number of apparently respectable "front organisations" which hid their IRA-Sinn Fein connexions. 
Chief among 
them were the Dublin Housing Action Committee, the National Waters Restoration League (now also split into pro-Goulding and pro-Brady factions), the Wolfe Tone Society and, in the United Kingdom, Clann na h’Eireann. IRA members were encouraged to co-operate with or belong to any other organisation for their own purposes. For instance, in Northern Ireland after 1968, the successful Civil Rights Association became a prime target for both IRA and Communist infiltration and these now provide the greater part of the leadership. Other IRA-infiltrated organisations in Ulster now include the Catholic Ex-Servicemen’s Association (CESA) and the Association for Legal Justice. 
After the split of 1969-70, the Official IRA continued to pursue these tactics. The breakaway Provisionals developed their own variations.

BACKGROUND NOTE ON THE ASSOCIATION MR LEGAL JUSTICE FORMATION AND AIMS The ALJ was formed in February 1971. The People’s Democracy were active in its creation along with NICRA and both factions of the IRA. Its originAl aims were to secure the release of all "political prisoners", to protect the rights of such prisoners pending their release and to prevent the introduction of internment. Once internment was introduced its abolition became the ALJ’s prime aim in cooperation with all opposition groups in Northern Ireland. The ALJ defines a "political prisoner" as anyone in prison for an offence arising out of political causes in Northern Ireland. OPERATION It is, of course, Republican oriented. Though the name of the organisation is ambiguous, the ALJ is not in any sense a legal body but a propaganda group. The ALJ forms what might be termed an unofficial complaints bureau whereby anyone having a complaint, real or imagined, can-get in touch with willing solicitors who will take down a deposition which has every appearance of a legal document. This is then publicised, rather than being sent as a serious complaint to the RUC or other authority. ALJ also buys advertising space to publicise the allegations, and they have consolidated allegations of certain subjects and put them out in booklet form. 
It is interesting to note that this technique is justified by ALJ on the grounds that no one can expect justice from the courts here, yet cases when the courts have found against members of the security forces for assault or other offences have been reported in the newspapers.

OF HOME AFFAIRS TO DEFER EXECUTION OF A WARRANT FOR THE LEVYING OF A FINE PENDING THE HEARING OF PETITION FROM THE PERSON FIND 
CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL 
POSITION OF THE GOVERNOR AND MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS 
QUESTION RAISED BY MR JUSTICE BROWN AS TO THIS RIGHT OF THE MINISTER 
EXERCISE OF THE PREROGATIVE OF MERCY. 
The position of His Grace the Governor in connection with the exercise of the Prerogative of Mercy or other 
Government RUC 
executive power of His Majesty the King is clearly defined and provided for in Section 8 of the 
of Ireland Act, 1920, read with Paragraph 1 of the First Schedule to the Irish Free State (Consequential 
Provisions) Act, 1922. The latter provision provides for the appointment of 
a Governor in Northern Ireland in whom shall be vested all the powers, duties, rights and privileges previously exerciseable by or vested in the Lord Lieutenant under the Act of 1920. 
Section 8 of the Act of 1920 provided that the 
Lord Lieutenant shall exercise any Prerogative or other executive power of His Majesty, the exercise of which might be delegated to him, and the Section further provided that in the exercise of such delegated powers the Governor should act through and on the advice of a responsible Minister 
The present Governor of Northern Ireland, His Grace 
the Duke of Abercorn, was appointed by His Majesty on the 9th December, 1922, and-under the terms of the Letters Patent of that date constituting the office of Governor of Northern Ireland he was authorised to do and execute as respects Northern Ireland all things which by virtue of the Act of 1920 or by Letters Patent dated 27th April, 1921, or otherwise belonged to the office of Lord Lieutenant at the time of the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922, or which belonged to the said office of-Governor by virtue of the-Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1922, and under the Letters Patent governing the particular appointment. 
In the instructions passed under the Royal sign, 
Manual and Signet and incorporated with the Letters Patent governing the appointment of the Duke of Abercorn specific directions are prescribed in connection with the exercise of the Prerogative of Mercy. These directions will be found inArticle 5 of the Instructions and lay down that the Governor shall not grant a pardon, reprieve or remission of sentence in respect of an offence committed in Northern Ireland without in any capital cases first receiving the advice of the Executive Committee and in other cases the advice of one at least of the Ministers of the Government of Northern Ireland. 
There are other instructions dealing with offences of 
a political nature and of an international character which are not relevant to the present case. 
It will be observed from the above that a reference 
is made in the Letters Patent of the 9th December, 1922 to the previous Letters Patent issued on the 27th April, 1921 in particular connection with the powers of the Lord Lieutenant and it would not be out of place to quote an extract from Article 3 of the latter Letters Patent. This Article reads as follows

INTERROGATION: THE FOLLOW UP TO THE REPORT OF THE COMPTON COMMITTEE Introduction The purpose of this note is to explore the course of action 
which the Government might take following the publication of the report of the Compton Committee. 2. 
The paper is based on the assumptions that the report finds 
that physical ill-treatment, though not brutality or cruelty, was used in the interrogation of eleven internees; that the report does not make a judgement as to whether it was right or wrong for physical ill-treatment to be used in the circumstances; and that the Government accepts the findings of the report as regards the treatment of internees under interrogation. 3. 
It is also assumed that the report incorporates in some form 
or another the substance of the Government Note on Interrogation which was submitted to the Committee, and that the general rules for the conduct of interrogation are thus made public. 
The Government’s response to the report 4. 
Once the Compton Committee’s report is published the 
Government will be expected to say not only whether it accepts its findings but also what changes, if any, are to be made to the rules governing the conduct of interrogation in the light of the report’s findings. The Government can react to the Report in one of two ways. 
Either it can decide that the general rules 
as set out in paragraph 2 of the Government’s Note on Interrogation which was given to the Compton Committee should be changed in tae direction of making them less stringent and therefore more favourable to those under interrogation. Or the Government can decide that the principles governing the conduct of interrogation, which have been built up in the light of experience over many years

1. The general rules governing the custody of detainees and the 
processes of interrogation have been reviewed from time to time by the Government Departments and agencies concerned in the light of experience gained in the various internal security operations in which HMG have been involved since the last war. The techniques of interrogation currently in use have also been employed in many previous internal security situations. The latest instructions on the rules to be followed were issued in 1965, and were revised in 1967 to provide for the daily inspection by a medical officer in the light of the recommendations in the Report on the Aden situation by Mr Roderic Bowen Q.C. issued in November 1966 (Cmd 3165). 2. 
These general rules include the following safeguards: a. 
b. c. Subjects to be seen daily by a Medical Officer. 
The following are prohibited: (i) 
Violence to life and person, in particular, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture. 
(ii) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment. 
d. 
Subjects are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline. 
(These rules follow the broad principles for the treatment of persons under arrest or detention during civil disturbances as laid down in Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative 
to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949 3. The precise application of these general rules in particular 
circumstances is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the part of those immediately responsible for the operations in question. Intelligence is the. key to successful operations

DRAFT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER Sir Edmund Compton has now reported to the Home Secretary. His 
report is being published as a White Paper and is now available in the Vote Office. Sir Edmund’s verdict is that allegations of brutality agaist the 
security forces are not substantiated though he has examined them with meticulous care. 
He does, however, consider that in the case of a small 
number of individuals who were interrogated there was physical ill-treatment, though not serious enough to inflict physical or mental injury. 
Full 
details are given in his report. The techniques of interrogation used have been employed on a number 
of occasions in the past in dealing with terrorist compaigns. occasion was in Aden in 1966. The last On that occasion the then Government asked 
Mr. Bowen to carry out an enquiry, which was published as a White Paper. Subsequently in 1967 revisions were made to the safeguards under which these techniques can be used. These safeguards include provision that there should be no brutal or 
humiliating treatment and that there should be constant medical supervision to guard against mental or physical injury. On this occasion (a) 
the principles and safeguards were fully observed

discuss the question whether what was done in Northern Ireland as recorded in the Compton Report was fully in accordance with these principles. 
3. However, it is possible (as indicated in my separate minute 
of today to PUS, not to all) that Sir Edmund Compton has not in all respects correctly interpreted the evidence presented to him. 
This point will be followed up separately. Meanwhile 
VCGS, in consultation with the Defence Intelligence Staff, is initiating a domestic enquiry into the techniques and methods taught at JSIW, and their application. 
to VCGS that the Commandant of the Intelligence Centre and Inspector of Intelligence should be asked:- 
(a) To examine, and recommend whether any changes are desirable in, the techniques and methods taught at JSIW as adjuncts to the process of interrogation of prisoners or detainees. 
(b) To enquire into the advice that was given to the RUC Special Branch in respect of those methods and techniques, and the circumstances, intensity, and duration of their application; and to recommend whether any changes are desirable in the application of these methods and techniques in internal security operations.

NOTE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE I attach a copy of a letter that Sir Philip Allen has 
received from Sir Edmund Compton, together with a draft of the section of the Compton Report dealing with the complaints made of physical brutality in respect of two of the individuals subjected to interrogation in depth. 2. 
When the Compton Inquiry was set up, a letter dated 
26 August from the Prime Minister’s office to Sir Philip Allen specified that it should be explained to those who carried out the inquiry that the process of interrogation was a security matter, which could not be investigated, although allegations of possible brutality occurring during the process of interrogation could be looked into. Sir Edmund and his colleagues were so briefed by the Home Office; and subsequently received a briefing on the interrogation techniques concerned. 
You had yourself 
received a note on these techniques behind a minute from VCGS dated 9 August 
3. Although Sir Edmund claims that he says nothing of the 
interrogation process itself, or of its results, his draft does in fact describe certain elements of the interrogation process. Hooding and subjection to "white sound" are certainly part of the process, and it can also be argued that standing against a wall a meagre diet are part of the process of breaking men down. Sir Edmund and his colleagues conclude that these in varying degree constitute physical ill-treatment but not brutality.

NOTE BY THE LAW OFFICERS NORTHERN IRELAND - INTERROGATION AND THE JUDGES RULES The Law Officers have been asked to advise the Secretary 
of State (Northrn Ireland) of the correct doctrine on the extent to which questioning under the Judges Rules, and more general interrogation, might be mutually inhibiting (see Gen. 79 minutes, 32nd meeting, p.6 .) 
2. It is axiomatic that it is not unlawful to ask 
a person a question, and this notwithstanding that he is in custody. Interrogation of persons whom the police suspect of the commission of an offence is circumscribed by the Judges Rules, but these rules, though they are to be followed in practice, do not have the force of law. Breaches of the rules can, and serious breaches will, render answers to questions inadmissable as evidence in any subsequent trial. 
3. The provisions of the Special Powers legislation 
dealing with detention do not distinguish between custody for general interrogation purposes and custody of a person against whom charges have been or are likely to be brought. Thus there is clearly scope for argument as to what questions can properly be asked when the purposes of the questioning are mixed, and it is therefore essential to proceed with caution if the admissability of answers to questions taken under the Judges Rules procedure is not to be jeopardised. 
4. Where a person has been questioned in accordance 
with the Judges Rules and it is decided that no charges are to be brought, no particular difficulty arises, and interrogation can continue to take place otherwise than in

ARREST POLICY 
The following should be arrested if the opportunity arises: a) 
b) c) d) e) 
Anyone against whom there is known to be evidence to justify the preferring of criminal charges. 
Anyone against whom there is thought to be evidence which might justify the preferring of criminal charges (subject to further questioning). 
Anyone known to be holding officer rank in the Provisional IRA even though there is no evidence to justify criminal proceedings. 
Anyone caught in the act of committing or having just committed a criminal offence. 
Anyone caught in the company of someone caught in the act of committing or having just committed a criminal offence if there is reason to think he may be able to give information about the offence or important information about the IRA generally. But an arrest under e) by a member of HM Forces acting without the express authority of an RUC officer should only be made if he suspects the person concerned of having committed acts, or being about to commit acts, prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or the maintenance of order. 
2. Anyone arrested will bequestioned first in accordance with 
Judges’ Rules, if there is any possibility of criminal charges being brought. Thereafter he may be questioned at large in accordance with the instructions in the attached Annex to see whether he can provide any valuable information about criminal activities.

INTERROGATION BY THE SECURITY FOR CES IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
INTRODUCTION 1. 
The general principles on which interrogation in internal 
security operations is to be based are set out in the "Directive on Interrogation to the Armed Forces in Internal Security Operations". In operations in Northern Ireland it applies to both the RUC and to the army or other services concerned. 
2. The aim of this instruction, which supplements the Directive, is 
to set out the basic rules, requirements and methods to be followed during interrogation operations in Northern Ireland. It applies to, and covers the responsibilities of, both the RUC and the armed forces. It will be considered always in conjunction with the Directive. GENERAL INSTRUCTIoNS The Object of Interrogation 3. 
Under the present arrest policy most people arrested are being 
questioned with a view to criminal charges being brought; but those against whom charges cannot be brought are being questioned for intelligence purposes according to instructions in the Directive referred to above. This will continue. But those who are questioned for intelligence purposes may, at the discretion of the RUC, be taken to a Police Office for interrogation. That interrogation will be carried out just as if it had taken place under existing instructions but the following instructions should also be observed. General Procedures 4. 
As soon as possible, as much information as can be obtained about 
the subject should be made available to the interrogator. It will be essential to have information which positively identifies the subject, together with the reason for the circumstances of the arrest. 5. .The circumstances of the arrest or capture of a subject for interrogation have considerable bearing on the success or otherwise of his subsequent interrogation.

DRAFT ANSWER After carefully considering the issues 
Involved I have come to the conclusion that, for the reasons which I indicated in reply to the rt. hon. Gentleman on 2nd March it would not be practicable or advisable to publish these instructions. NOTES FOR SUPPLEMENTARIES 1 Mr. Lyon’s supplementary question of 
2nd March and the Prime Minister’s reply are attached. 
2. Mr, Lyon is a member of the Younger 
Committee on Privacy whose report is expected very shortly. He is also a barrister and a member of the British Council of Churches 3. 
The basic Directive on interrogation 
has been intensively reviewed in the light of the Parker Committee’s report; and the revised version will be submitted for Ministerial approval in the very near future. 
It will 
need even more careful consideration in the light of the renewed allegations of brutality by the security forces in Northern Ireland. 4. 
Until the new Directive has been 
endorsed by Ministers the less said in public on this subject the better. Andfeven when the Directive has been approved it will remain true

that it would be foolish to give the enemy advance warning of the techniques of interrogation which he may encounter, however "legitimate" these techniques may be,

JOINT DIRECTIVE ON INTERROGATION IN OPERATIONS BY THE ARMED FORCES 
INTRODUCTION 1. Persons arrested or detained during military operations, but particularly 
during Internal Security operations or in near emergency situations are likely to be valuable sources of intelligence. 
Even though there will normally be 
other ways of gaining information interrogation ay sometimes be the only source of intelligence 
at a time when it is urgently required. 
2. When British forces are operating in aid of the civil power, the conduct of interrogation is a matter for the civil authorities. 
If it should be 
necessary for Service personnel to carry out interrogation in order to obtain intelligence in any military operation, or if, in exceptional circumstances, the civil authority is unable to carry out interrogation, the principles and procedures set out in this directive shall apply. 
Before Service personnel 
are used for interrogation, the approval of UK Ministers is necessary in each specific case. 
3. Successful interrogation depends upon careful planning of the procedures 
for handling subjects for interrogation and of the interrogation itself. Successful interrogation my be a lengthy process. 
Any subject therefore must be properly handled and treated from the moment of his arrest and adequate facilities provided for his interrogation.

JOINT DIRECTIVE ON INTERROGATION IN OPERATIONS BY THE ARMED FORCES INSTRUCTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL OPERATIONS 
Reference ’A’ JIC 
INTRODUCTION 1. 
the conduct of interrogation by Service personnel. 
Reference ’A’ is the overall authority on tho rules and conditions governing It requires, inter alia., 
detailed instructions to be issued seperately for any interrogation operation. 
AIM 2. 
The aim of this paper is to set out the basic rules and requirements on 
which interrogation is to be based and which are to be incorporated and, if necessary, amplified in the detailed instructions issued for each interrogation operation. 
They are to be considered always in conjunction with ref ’A’. This paper and Ref ’A’ are always to be referred to in such detailed instructions. 
DEFINITION 3. 
Interrogation is defined as the systematic extraction of information from 
a willing, or unwilling, subject who has boon specially selected as likely to be able to provide useful information.

THE PARKER REPORT 
Background 1. 
This Report is to be published today and a Statement will be made in the 
House at 1530 hours. A copy of the definitive text of the statement is attached. 2. 
3. All questions on other aspects of the Report should be referred to the 
Home Office. Line to be taken Q.1 
A.l 
Can you give us details of the training in escape, evasion and interrogation which is given to servicemen? 
Troops may undergo practical training in how to avoid capture or to escape from capture and to prevent information passing into the hands of the enemy. This training will include survival techniques in adverse climatic conditions and in different terrains, position finding and cross-country movement. 
Briefing on interrogation techniques may also be given. 
Q.2 A.2 
Q.3 A.3 
Q.4 A.4 
Q.5 A.5 
Q.6 A.6 
Q.7 A.7 
Who trains the servicemen ? 
These form of training are a unit responsibility and are carried out in unit lines 
and service training areas. Is this training common to the forces of other countries? 
The curriculum for training the services for war in most countries includes training in the avoidance of capture by an enemy, and in the prevention of information being passed to an enemy by captured troops. 
Surely there is some specialist training? 
Certain selected categories of servicemen most likely to be at risk of capture are also given practical training. 
What categories of servicemen? 
As I said, those vulnerable to capture and likely to be in possession of important information, eg. certain aircrew and some members of recconnaissance units. 
How are these categories trained? 
Normally the training comes at the end of an escape and evasion exercise which is carried out on available service training areas. 
Can these men opt out at any time? 
Yes, all are volunteers and understand that they may opt out at any stage of the practical part of interrogation training. 
It is not known ho many supplementary questions will be asked but answers 
from Defence Press Officers should be restricted to questions related to that part where the Armed Forces have been involved.

STATEMENT ON THE PARKER REPORT NOTES FOR SUPPLEMENTARIES 
1. Future of interrogation in depth 
The second sentence might better read "It is only the specific techniques examined in the Parker Report and employed as an aid to interrogation which are to be discontinued." 
As we are saying that interrogation in depth will continue where necessary the next question could be what techniques will be used. So far as the Army is concerned the position is: 
"When the Army is operating in aid of the civil power, the conduct of interrogation remains a matter for the civil authorities. If it should become necessary for 
Army personnel to carry out interrogation in order to obtain intelligence in any future military operations, the methods used would be based on the practice of the civil police in the United Kingdom. The methods to be used in training servicemen to resist interrogation by an enemy are under review." 
2. Use of other techniques in other circumstances 
The reference to paragraph 36 of the Majority Report in the last sentence is unnecessary. Although this paragraph does refer to the use of techniques for the purposes of security and safety the recommendation to issue guidelines was largely in the context of using the techniques for interrogation and this is now overtaken by the Government’s decision. Also we would not want to imply that the Army are concerned with these processes in Northern Ireland. The point could be simply made by saying "Appropriate instructions have been given to the Army as regards wall-standing: persons in Army custody will not be hooded These instructions of course only apply to the Army and leave open the question of the RUC. No, doubt the Home Office will advise in this respect. 
5. Role of the Army in respect of interrogation 
For the reasons that I have already explained to Peter Gregson this morning the references to detention and internment should be avoided since the Army are concerned with guarding internment centres and providing support to the Prison Staff in the event of disturbances in the camps, and at Long Kesh military police are controlling entry and exit. It is necessary only to deal with the point at issue and we suggest therefore that the answer in this case should be confined to the final paragraph of the instruction to the GOC which was discussed at the Prime Minister’s meeting this morning.

CASE OF W J MOORE 
Background Note 1. 
1971 by Servicemen and removed to the Regional Holding Centre Ballykinler where he was placed in an empty hut with others who had been arrested. He was guarded in the hut by soldiers. He was transferred to the Maidstone early on 11 August and released on 24 August. At some unspecified time thereafter, he disappeared over the Border into the Republic whence he has not officially returned. On 13 September, a writ was issued on his behalf claiming damages for wrongful arrest and imprisonment and assault, trespass to the person and battery. 
W J Moore was arrested in the early morning of 9 August 2. The preliminary hearing of the case took place on 2 and 17 
November when the question of the discovery of documents was dealt with. Only one Ministry of Defence document, a Brigade Order less some appendices, was withheld on grounds of security, and the Judge accepted the Secretary of State’s certificate without apparent demur on 17 November. The RUC attempted to withhold a number of documents mainly on the grounds of the need to protect the identity of individuals but the Judge refused to accept Mr Faulkner’s certificate and Counsel appealed against this ruling. 
3. On 22 November the main hearing began, and the Plaintiff 
failed to appear. His Counsel argued that the failure was due to fear of further arrest and that this fear was justified by the fact that "military personnel had made a number of visits to his home.’ Although Moore was wanted by the Police for questioning, this was not revealed to the Judge nor were Moore’s false allegations refuted. In fact military personnel had paid one visit only to Moore’s house in the company of the civil police. An undertaking not to arrest Moore was demanded by Counsel as a precondition of appearance, but the Civil Police naturally refused. The case was adjourned until 22 December when, in the absence of an undertaking to Moore, the Judge ruled that his evidence could be taken in absentia by virtue of a sworn affidavit. The case was reopened on 19 January when Counsel for the Crown gave notice of appeal against both the disclosure of RUC documents and the hearing of the case in the plaintiff’s absence. The plaintiff waived the claim for disclosure and the Judge decided to hear the case. 
4. At the end of the six-day hearing he reserved his judgment 
which was delivered on 18 February. The judgment was that the plaintiff had been wrongfully arrested and detained (due to procedural irregularity) and that he had suffered sufficient in the way of assault, even if many of the allegations of serious ill-treatment had not been proved, to justify the award of the total sum of £300 claimed. This can be construed to mean broadly that the Judge considered the treatment established by the Compton Report by itself to constitute assault as justifying the portion of the £300 damages which was not attributable to wrongful arrest and imprisonment.

Following it the draft of a statement to be televised by 
Mr. Faulkner and issued. Begins. 
1. If Northern Ireland is to survive and prosper, two things 
are essential. We must sustain a continuing programme of economic and soial development, and we must find the means to create a more united society here 
- one in which all men of 
good will, however divergent their legitimato political views may participate to the full. These things are, and will continue to be, the aims of our policy. 2. 
Neither will be possible in a climate of terrorism and 
violence. The outrages to which we have been subjected now threaten our economic life and create every day deeper divisions and antagonism within our community. These, indeed, are the clear objects of those who carry them out. 3. 
Every means has been tried to make terrorists amenable to 
the law. Nor have such methods been without success, because a substantial number of the most prominent leaders of the IRA are now serving ordinary prison sentences. But the terrorist campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthless viciousness. 4. 
I have therefore decided, after weighing all the relevant 
considerations, including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with HMG in the UK last Thursday, to exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as Minister of Home Affairs. 
5. Accordingly, a number of men have been detained by the 
security forces at various places in Northern Ireland this morning. I will be making internment orders in respect of such of these men as constitute a serious and continuing threat to public order and safety. This will be done only after a careful scrutiny of information furnished to me by the police in respect of each ouch person, sufficient to convince me that the individual in question is a threat to present peace and maintenance of order. Any such person will then have the right

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE VIEWS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
CONCERNING INTERROGATION A CAN A PERSON BE INTERROGATED UNDER REGULATION 11 
PENDING THE MAKING OF A DETENTION ORDER? NO SPECIFIC POWER TO INTERROGATE IS GIVEN BUT THERE 85 IF HE IS 
NO REASON WHY A.PERSON SHOULD NOT BE INTERROGATED. 
INTERROGATED IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND DISCLOSES INFORMATION RELATING TO OTHER PERSONS ON WHICH THE POLICE CAN USEFULLY ACT OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN PROPERLY DO SO. BUT IF INTERROGATION INN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BRINGS FORTH AN ADMISSION OR CONFESSION BY THE PERSON QUESTIONED IN RELATION TO A CRIME COMMITTED BY HIMSELF SUCH A CONFESSION OR ADMISSION WOULD BE IN BREACH OF THE JUDGES RULES AND, 
IN PARTICULAR, RULE 3 THEREOF WHICH 
PREVENTS THE QUESTIONING OF PERSONS IN CUSTODY IN SO FAR AS THE ADMISSIBILITY IN COURT IS CONCERNED OF SUCH EVIDENCE. THE JUDGES RULES ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH THE ADMISSIBILITY AT A TRIAL WHERE AN ADMISSION OR CONFESSION IS MADE. 
THEY ARE 
NOT CONCERNED WITH SIMPLY WHAT IS SAID BY A PERSON QUESTIONED IN CUSTODY BUT WHICH IS NOT USED AS EVIDENCE AT A TRIAL. 
B 
DOES A DETENTION ORDER ALTER THIS POSITION? IT DOES NOT. 
THE POSITION IS THE SAME AND A PERSON MAY BE INTERROGATED AFTER A DETENTION ORDER IS MADE. 
INFORMATION IN RELATION TO OTHER PERSONS OR EVEN IN RELATION TO HIS OWN ACTIVITIES THIS MAY BE ACTED ON BUT ANY CONFESSION OR ADMISSION HE MAKES IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE CONTRARY TO THE JUDGES RULES AND WILL BE INADMISSIBLE AT HIS TRIAL.

INTERROGATION AFTER INERNMENT BUT WILL BE ASKED TO DO SO. A NON EXPERT VIEW IS THAT THE POSITION IS LIKELY TO BE THE SAME AS DURING THE PHASE OF DETENTION.

internment in the Republic in parallel with action by HMG, should we decide that the security situation in Northern Ireland requires this step. No decision on this point has been made. Our present thinking in regard to timing of n approach is based on the following points: (a) If decision on Apprentice Boys March in Derry on 12 
August does not fully 
meet Mr. Lynch’s views, any approach on internment should be delayed until afterwards, 
(b) Since chances of a favourable response by Mr. Lynch must be small, we want to make the approach in such a way as to minimise the risk of the approach and his response becoming known and jeopardising action in the North. 
(c) Approach should therefore be mad, in first instance, on a hypothetical basis, mentioning no dates and leaving final decision to be made in the future.

Detention and Internment 
The power of internment is contained in Regulation 12 made under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Acts (Northern Ireland) 1922-43, 
The power to 
intern is such criticised and is inconsistent with the European Human Rights Convention; a notice of derogation was lodged in 1957. 
The powers contained 
in Regulation 12 were last used during the IRA campaign against Northern Ireland front 1956-62. 2.

in-point at present. 3. 
Regulation 11 confers powers of deention and in practice further action to intern or to charge under criminal legislation It is not thought that these powers are much 
whether he was contemplating the use of internment powers. 
Before his resignation Major Chichester-Clark was asked from time to time The standard reply 
which he evolved was that his security advisers - the GOC and the Chief Constable- 
did not recommend it at the time, but if they were to recommend it he would not hesitate to act. Since he succeeded as northern Ireland Prime Minister Mr Faulkner has confirmed that this is his view on the introduction of internment. The Northern Ireland Government has a firm commitment to consult H.M.G. before making a final decision. 
of internment lay in the hands of the Northern Ireland Government. 
Mr Heath said in Edinburgh on 27 arch that the power It had 
often been stated by Stormont spokesmen, he said, that such measures as internment can only be taken if the Joint Security Committee advises it, but Mr Heath said his Government had never been asked to sanction such a measure. 4. 
On 4 December 1970 the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice of the Irish 
Republic issued a statement about their readiness to reactivate powers of internment without trial in the Republic because of information about plans for a secret armed conspiracy. 
The statement added that the Republic also had 
lodged a notice of derogation from certain provisions of the European Convention on human Rights. 
But little has been heard from the Republic of any steps to carry out the threat or of the alleged plot behind the move.

DRAFT LETTER TO PRIME MINISTER 
Internment 1. 
When we met at the end of last month to discuss Northern 
Ireland, it was agreed that Reggie Maudling and I should have further discussions with the object of finding funds for the construction of an internment camp at Long Kesh. 
2. It is clear that the Northern Ireland Government are unable 
to contribute to the project, at least at this stage; and the Home Office have no authority to finance such accommodation in Northern Ireland. 
possible, I see little profit in trying to find any other way round the impasse. 
3. I am therefore giving instructions that the necessary 
financial arrangements should be put in hand for the project to be paid for, at least initially, out of Defence Votes. I hope the work can begin bythe end of the month.

NORTHERN IRELAND - 1. INTERNMENT When the Ministerial Committee on Northern Ireland examined the 
joint MOD/Home Office paper on Internment (1) on 17 March, they agreed (2) that a reconnaissance party should review, on the ground, the possible internment sites which had been put forward. 2. 
The party, which included MOD representatives of the Dockyard 
Department, the Director of Quartering, the Royal Engineers, and a Home Office representative from the Prison Department, have now reported. Annex A summarizes their findings. The Findings 3. 
The reconnaissance has confirmed that Long Kesh is the most suitable 
long term site. Accommodation can be provided there which would serve either as an internment camp for up to 450 male and female internees of different persuasions and up to 100 custodians with all necessary facilities. If in the event it were not needed for this primary purpose it would provide emergency accommodation of a reasonable standard for use by a battalion. It could be built in such a way that the external signs of its use as an internment camp 
- for example, guard towers and corrugated iron fencing - could be left for erection only when this 
use was intended; and that the internal facilities required in this event 
an alternative legitimate designation. 4. 
- e.g. reception centre, refractory cell block - could be given For the most rapid completion, quickly assembled material would 
have to be used and military manpower employed for most of the construction. Even so, and assuming a smooth work flow, the complete camp would still take about 6 months to complete from the time that approval was given. However, construction can be phased to ensure that a viable camp to take around 150 internees and their custodians could be complex in about 2½ months.

ANNEX 
SUMMARY OF RECONNAISSANCE PARTY’S FINDINGS A. 
LONG TERM SOLUTION 1. The disused airfield at Long Kesh provides the most suitable 
location, convenient to Belfast but away from populated areas, and with a military presence close by. The best site would be where two old runways intersect, giving a solid base on which to build. Accommodation 2. 
The proposed layout is: a. 
For internees 5 separate compounds, 4 holding 100 each 
and 1 holding 50. This would provide for segregation by types as well as by sexes if required. (It would be intended to build the 50-capacity hut as women’s accommodation). b. 
house up to 100. 3. Cells, recreation rooms and spaces, reception and visitors’ rooms 
and other necessary facilities would need to be built, as part of the camp. An interrogation centre, however, should be housed outside the camp area and could be an existing building suitably modified. 4. 
For Custodians A separate complex of buildings which would All the facilities for the internees and their custodians can be 
designed to double for Service accommodation so that the camp can be used for that purpose. For example, the custodians’ facilities would be based on a design for officers’ and senior NCO’s messes of battalion size, and could be used as such. Layout and Security Arrangements 5. 
The internees’ accommodation should be laid out withn two 
perimeter fences, the inner one of chain-link, the outer faced with corrugated iron. Dannert wire should, in addition, be laid between the two fences and/or guard dogs could patrol it. There should be at least one guard tower at each corner of the outer perimeter fence (which would form a rectangle approximately 1000’ x 550’). These towers

DEBRIEFING LIEUTENANT COLONEL M.B. MCNABB Q2f(A) MEMBER OF THE Q QUARTERING REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INTERNMENT CAMP RECONNAISSANCE PARTY 
Introduction 1. Colonel McNabb returned from his reconnaissance in Northern Ireland 
on 17 March and I debriefed him on the afternoon of 18th. He made the points set out in the following paragraphs. 
2. Maidstone. The reconnaissance team looked over Maidstone, together with 
the Home Office representative,and concluded that it would provide satisfactory short term internment accommodation. They thought that it would not be useful for longer than one month. HQ Northern Ireland were content that they could make adequate security arrangements, but would like a Naval export to be briefed by the Home Office and then to visit and inspect Maidstone to advise on any internal work which may or may not be necessary before it could be used for internment. 
3. Maidstone remains and is confirmed as HQ Northern Ireland’s most suitable 
short term solution. 4. 
for internment, but its situation - 
Ballykinler. The camp at Ballykinler provides suitable accommodation (it is near the sea, access roads 
adjacent to UDR camp, and wooded areas) - 5. is most unsutiable for internment 
use. The Home Office expert was most unhappy at the idea of using the camp, two huts of which have been blown up in recent months. 
Longkesh. The reconnaissance party found a most suitable site adjacent 
to Longkesh 1 Camp where runways and taxi tracks provide good hard standings for the erection of a camp. Unfortunately this site is just within the area reserved to a meteorological station and there could be some difficulty in using this area because of possible interference with the radar instruments. This problem is now being investigated by Colonel McNabb and it is thought it can be overcome. 
6. There are a number of problems which require clear Home Office instructions before the final design of the camp can be completed. These are:- 
a. Status. The present terms of reference state that internees should be treated as convicted criminals. The Home Office official was most unhappy with this definition and believed that there would be humanitarian pressures to provide for creature comforts. Home Office guidance is urgently needed to say:- 
(1) The space to be allowed for each prisoner. (2) The maximum number of prisoners per hut. 
(3) The provision of bed lighting and provision of curtains. 
(4) Whether visits by families are to be allowed, and if so under what conditions i.e. regular visiting hours daily. 
b. Cells. The reconnaissance team believe that at least six 
cells would be necessary and are including these in their plane, and-also that it would be necessary to provide an

INTERNMENT CAMPS POSSIBLE SITES 
Assumptions 1. 
a. b. 450. 
General Points 2. 
of a site: a. 
The following general points are relevant to the selection Time. There may not be much time to make arrangements. 
Accommodation which can be made secure quickly may, at least in the short term, be more acceptable than facilities which have other advantages. On the other hand the more time there is, the easier it will be to carry out adequate planning and complete satisfactory security measures. 
b. Secrecy. Preparations may have to be kept secret both 
for political and operational reasons. Planning for internment is bound to create considerable political and public interest and concern; by keeping plans secret the security forces may have a better chance of gathering the right men in the net (but see para 4 below). 
c. Cover Story. If preparations reach the actual construe 
tion stage and secrecy remains paramount it is clear that some cover story would need to be devised. Some sites will lend themselves better to this than others (but see para 4 below). 
d. Security. An ideal site must be both secure enough to 
prevent escape from inside and also secure and preferably remote enough to reduce the chances of an attack or liberation raid from outside. It should be away from politically sensitive areas both to avoid aggravating public feeling and. reduce the chance of large scale demonstrations; 
e. Size. It has been assumed that up to 450 internees 
would need to be accommodated. Any variation on this figure could affect the selection but particularly if a very much smaller number were to be interned; 
f. Duration. Conditions which might be acceptable for a 
very short term detention might not be acceptable if internment went on for a long period. 
The legal status of internees would be no better than 
that of convicted prisoners (under the Special Powers Act it is conceivable that they might be worse); 
The numbers to be interned could amount to as many as

CASE OF W J MOORE 1. W J Moore was arrested in the early morning of 9 August 
1971 by Servicemen and removed to the Regional Holding Centre Ballykinler where he was placed in an empty hut with others who had been arrested. He was guarded in the hut by soldiers. He was transferred to the Maidstone early on 11 August and released on 24 August. At some unspecified time thereafter, he disappeared over the Border into the Republic whence he has not officially returned. On 13 September, a writ was issued on his behalf claiming damages for wrongful arrest and imprisonment and assault, trespass to the person and battery. 
2. The preliminary hearing of the case took place on 2 and 17 
November when the question of the discovery of documents was dealt with. Only one Ministry of Defence document, a Brigade Order less some appendices, was withheld on grounds of security, and the Judge accepted the Secretary of State’s certificate without apparent demur on 17 November. The RUC attempted to withhold a number of documents mainly on the grounds of the need to protect the identity of individuals but the Judge refused to accept Mr Faulkner’s certificate and Counsel appealed against this ruling. 
3. On 22 November the main hearing began, and the Plaintiff 
failed to appear. His Counsel argued that the failure was due to fear of further arrest and that this fear was justified by the fact that "military personnel had made a number of visits to his home." Although Moore was wanted by the Police for questioning, this was not revealed to the Judge nor were Moore’s false allegations refuted. In fact military personnel had paid one visit only to Moore’s house in the company of the civil police. An undertaking not to arrest Moore was demanded by Counsel as a precondition of appearance, but the Civil Police naturally refused. The case was adjourned until 22 December when, in the absence of an undertaking to Moore, the Judge ruled that his evidence could be taken in absentia by virtue of a sworn affidavit. The case was reopened on 19 January when Counsel for the Crown gave notice of appeal against both the disclosure of RUC documents and the hearing of the case in the plaintiff’s absence. The plaintiff waived the claim for disclosure and the Judge decided to hear the case. 
4. At the end of the six-day hearing he reserved his judgment 
which was delivered on 18 February. The judgment was that the plaintiff had been wrongfully arrested and detained (due to procedural irregularity) and that he had suffered sufficient in the way of assault, even if many of the allegations of serious ill-treatment had not been proved, to justify the award of the total sum of £300 claimed. This can be construed to mean broadly that the Judge considered the treatment established 
by the Compton Report by itself to constitute assault as justifying the portion of the £300 damages which was not attributable to wrongful arrest and imprisonment.

In the light of their consideration of the 
Parker Report, Ministers have decided that hooding, enforced wall-standing, manufactured noise, restriction of diet and deprivation of sleep will not be used again as an aid to interrogation. Wall-standing for a short time may continue 
to be used by the Army when civilians are being searched to make sure that they are not armed. Wall-standing will not be enforced for any other purpose. On no account will persons in Army custody be hooded. The opportunity is taken to confirm that the 
Army will not become involved in the process of routine police questioning and interrogation:; this is solely a matter for the RUC

Ref. A01198 PRIME MINISTER 
Northern Ireland: Report of Lord Parker’s Committee on Interrogation Procedures 
The essence of the difference of opinion between the majority and the 
minority reports is that Lord Parker and Mr. Boyd-Carpenter think that, except in so far as their use is required for purposes of security and safety, the techniques in question should be used only where it is considered vitally necessary to obtain information, and then subject to the safeguards which they outline in paragraphs 36-42 of their report; while Lord Gardiner does not believe that there are any circumstances in which it would be right to employ them, even, apparently, for the security of detainees themselves. 2. 
The principal questions for consideration by Ministers would seem 
to be:(a) Issues of Principle An endorsement of the majority recommendations would include 
acceptance of the proposition that, in any case in which it was proposed to apply the techniques, the Minister concerned should take advice about the legal position and should, if necessary, take steps to ensure protection for those taking part in the operation. 
This presents a dilemma. If the 
recommendation is not accepted, those taking part in the operation would be legally at risk. Lord Gardiner considers that the techniques are illegal anywhere; and Lord Parker and Mr. Boyd-Carpenter, while not expressing a view upon questions which may be tested in the courts of Northern Ireland, consider that some, if not all, of the techniques would constitute criminal assaults under English law and might also give rise to civil proceedings. On the other hand, if the recommendation is accepted, a Minister who sought to ensure legal protection would have to overcome the objections which Lord Gardiner summarises in sub-paragraph (4) on pages 27 and 28 of his minority report. The implication of this dilemma is that Ministers might well feel that they could not for some time (and until some opportunity presented itself for the very difficult legislation involved in reversing legal cover) authorise the use of techniques of this kind in support of interrogation. This does not mean that there would be no more interrogation; the absence of these techniques would, however, underline the importance of the recommendation in paragraph 40 of the majority report, i. e. that a panel of highly skilled interrogators should be kept in being.

MR. HALEY’S CLAIM THAT INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES WERE NOT APPROVED BY MEMBERS OF THE LAST ADMINISTRATION 
The convention is that one Government does not 
examine the papers of its predecessor but the facts speak for themselves. 
The interrogation techniques have been used far 
many years. The broad guide lines which govern the present 
position were drawn up in 1965 - (not 1967). 
In the Aden campaign the interrogation techniques were used by the military - when the rt. hon. Gentleman was Secretary of State for Defence. 
Some 
of the allegations made at the time of Aden were similar to those made recently on Northern Ireland. 
The guide lines were reviewed in 1967 following the Bowen Report.

PRIME MINISTER Nearly all the items in the latest Northern Ireland 
political summary have been well reported in the Press. But it is interesting to note that the Craig-West Party in the Ulster Unionist Council now think they may be able to win a majority in the Council. 
170 of the 980 
members of the Council have supported a Resolution calling for the resignation of the Government. 
The 
Annual Meeting of the Council is due in March. Supporters of Major Chichester-Clark are said to have collected 250 signatures of Council delegates.

Prime Minister’s Personal Minute 
HOME SECRETARY Northern Ireland hen the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland was 
at Chequers he made it clear that he was not wholly satisfied with what his own Special Branch could achieve, and would welcome any help we could give him. 
I hope that you will be able to follow this up urgently, because I think that it is potentially an important element in containing and reducing the IRA threat to law and order in Belfast. Let us take the Commissioner of Police for the 
metropolis at his word and push all the special branch resources he can spare into Northern Ireland at the earliest possible opportunity. I am sending copies of this minute to the 
Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and to the Secretary of State for Defence.

Prime Minister’s Personal Minute 
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE Northern Ireland 
If the view is taken that we now have to deal 
not so much with inter-community dissension and mob rioting as with a shooting confrontation between the British Army and the IRA, I suggest that we have to review the strategy for the deployment of British troops in Northern Ireland. 2. 
At present we have to fight the IRA largely on ground and at times of their choosing. 
Presumably the 
strategic objective should be to transfer the confrontation to ground and times of our choosing. 
If we believed 
that there was a constant come-and-go of IRA terrorists between the North and the South, there might be something to be said for transferring some of the Army’s effort from the cities to the border. 3. 
should be related to an up-to-date assessment of the strategic situation and objectives.

Ref. A09980 General Assessment The Committee should take the opportunity to assess the political 
situation; to review the immediate future as respects public order; and to take stock of progress on some of the points which arose from your meeting with Mr. Faulkner in April. General Political Situation 2. 
The Committee will want to hear from the Home Secretary how he gauges 
the current political temperature at Stormont and how he rates the prospect for Mr. Faulkner’s recent initiatives on the formation of new Parliamentary Committees 
- in terms both of their acceptability to the Opposition and of 
their possible effect on Mr. Faulkner’s own future as Prime Minister. The despatch of 10th June from Mr. Howard Smith, the United Kingdom Representative in Belfast 
- although admittedly written nearly a fortnight 
before Mr. Faulkner’s speech in the Debate on the Address on 22nd June contains several critical references to his recent performance (which are conveniently summarised in the list - in paragraph 13 - of measures on which he might show more vigour and determination); and it observes in paragraph 11 that "It begins to look as if he lacks that authority, combined with a hint of menace, which a leader needs. 
It suggests that he is not the tough man we 
hoped to see". Can the Home Secretary forecast Mr. Faulkner’s chances of survival in the medium term? The JIC recently assessed Mr. Paisley’s speech on 26th June - in which he publicly offered himself as an alternative Government 
- as his most hostile utterance since Mr. Faulkner became 
Prime Minister. Relations with the Republic 3. 
It seems too soon to begin making detailed plans for your discussions 
with Mr. Lynch in the autumn. But Dr. Hillery is to meet the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary on Tuesday afternoon, 6th July; and, although this may be little more than a ritual expression of concern, for domestic consumption, about the forthcoming marches, it provides an opportunity to sound him about Mr. Lynch’s own attitude to the autumn meeting and his hopes for its outcome. 
I have a - wholly irrational - instinct that 
the fact that Eire is joining the United Kingdom (including Ulster) in the uncharted journey of exploration into the EEC might be made the occasion

Ref: A09982 
Control of Northern Ireland Borders (NI(71) 5) 
This report conforms to the Secretary of State’s forecast of 
5th May in that it rejects, for reasons well summarised in paragraph 2, the view that an intensification of Border control would represent the best use of military resources. 2. 
It might be useful for the Committee to consider the recommendations 
in Annex A one by one, bearing in mind the following comments:Recommendation a. The whole-time UDR proposal will have been discussed under Item 1. A "sheltered water capability" means boats(!) with which to patrol sheltered waters such as Carlingford Lough. 
Recommendation c. It will be necessary to ensure that all these ideas are pursued to a time-scale which would enable you to raise them personally with Mr. Lynch in the autumn if discussions at a lower level have not produced the desired result before then. As paragraph 7 of the paper indicates, there are some sensitive matters which Mr. Lynch will wish to keep very much in his own hands, particularly, I imagine, those entailing covert co-operation between Forces on either side of the border. Some time before your meeting with Mr. Lynch in the autumn it will be necessary to review the question of co-operation from the Republic, with a view to seeing if there are points on which pressure should be renewed or any fresh proposals put to Mr. Lynch. 
Recommendation d. Intelligence is a critical factor; and it would be no bad thing to emphasise its importance by requesting an oral report from the Secretary of State or the VCGS (who will attend the meeting, deputising for the CGS) on progress since the Committee’s last meeting when, you will remember, the CGS described the efforts which he had made to improve co-operation at working level between the Northern Ireland Special Branch and the Army.

You should say that we had noted the concern 
the Irish had privately expressed late on Friday, and had sought to provide the facts. This was in the tradition of diplomatic consultations we had built up. The allegation that British troops were suppressing those protesting legitimately against intimidation, that British troops had, or had risked, "excessive reaction" in support of "discriminatory action"

The following is a summary of progress:- 
Community Relations Ministry was established on 29th October 1969. Commission has been appointed and is in operation. 
Field officers 
operate at grass roots level in key areas. Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (Sir Edmund Compton) was 
appointed in December 1969 to investigate complaints against Central Government including personnel matters in the Civil Service. 
His report 
for 1970 shows that of 33 cases fully investigated, only two shoved maladministration and none discrimination. Commissioner for Complaints was appointed in December 1969 to deal with 
grievances arising from maladministration by public bodies other than Government Departments. 
The Commissioner’s third report, published in 
March 1971, recorded that of 285 cases fully investigated during 1970 only 14 showed maladministration and none discrimination. Incitement to Hatred; the Prevention of Incitement to Hatred Act enacted 
in 1970 makes it an offence to incite hatred on religious or on any other grounds. Local Government Reforms stemming from the Macrory Report are the subject of a separate Other reforms are:-

The Northern Ireland Prime Minister stated in Stormont on 17th December 
1970 that his Government intended to introduce reforms closely following the redomendations contained in the Macrory Report which had been published in June and debated in October. 
The 73 existing County, Urban and Rural 
District Councils are to be abolished and 26 new District Councils elected in the autumn of 1972. 
The new District and Ward boundaries are to be 
drawn by a new Commission; each ard will contain the same number of electors - balance being the major cause of the accusations of gerrymandering under the present systems Legislation has been enacted to create the new Comission which is responsible for drawing up the new District and Ward boundaries, guided by the principle that each Wards should contain the same number of electors

for health and personal social services will be vested in the Ministers for Education and for Health and Social Services who will delegate executive responsibility to Area Boards which will each cover a number of Districts and include Councils’ representatives, as well as professional and nominated members. 
The Minister of Development is taking over responsibility for 
housing, and a Housing Executive has now started to take up responsibility for all housing allocations and construction within the Province. 
The 
Minister will later assume direct responsibility for planning, roads and bridges, water conservation, sewerage and protection of the countryside. A new rating system will be introduced to include a district and a regional rate, the latter and possibly also theformer being collected by the Government.

AND THE REFORM PROGRAMME IN NORTHERN IRELAND. THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: 
A COMPARISON BETWEEN CONDITIONS THERE NORTHERN IRELAND 
Housing A new Housing Executive, responsible for all functions of housing including allocation throughout the Province, has been set up. The Roman Catholic minority is represented. The reform is designed to increase the stock of new houses and to eliminate discrimination in its allocation. All local housing authorities have adopted the model point system for housing allocation. 
Local Government Legislation passed in 1969 gave full franchise on the basis of one man one vote in local government elections 
- it had already existed in Parliamentary elections - and vote 
at age 18. This year this franchise has been extended to local government by-elections. 24 new District Councils will be established in 
REPUBLIC OF IRELAND 
As in Britain, public housing is in the hands of local authorities. The main problem is chronic lack of funds, not irregularities in allocation, which in Dublin at least is done by lottery. 
There is a full franchise for those over 21 and no plural voting. However, the Dublin Corporation was suspended in 1969 after a row with the Government, and the city is still run by an appointed Commissioner. Other Councils, (Urban, Rural, City, County),

Following is the draft of a statement to be televised b 
Mr. Faulkner and issued. Begins. 
1. If Northern Ireland is to survive and prosper, two things 
are essential. We must sustain a continuing programme of economic and social development, and we must find the means to create a more united society here 
- one in which all men of good will, hoever divergent their legitimate political views, 
may participate to the full. These things are, and will continue to be, the aims of our policy. 2. 
Neither will be possible in a climate of terrorism and 
violence. The outrages to which we have been subjected now threaten our economic life and create every day deeper divisions and antagonism within our community. These, indeed, are the clear objects of those who carry then out. 3. 
Every means has been tried to make terrorists amenable to 
the law. Nor have much methods been without success, because a substantial number of the most prominent leaders of the IRA are now serving ordinary prison sentences. But the terrorist campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthless viciousness. 4. 
I have therefore decided, after weighing all the relevant 
considerations, including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with HMG in the UK last Thursday, to exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as minister of Home Affairs. 
5. Accordingly, a number of men have been detained by the 
security forces at various places in Northern Ireland this morning. I will be making internment orders in respect of such of these men as constitute a serious and continuing that to public order and safety. This will be done only after a careful scrutiny of information furnished to me by the polic in respect of each such person, sufficient to convince me that the individual in question is a threat to present peace and maintenance of order. Any such person will then have the right

I AM SENDING YOU THIS MESSAGE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND WILL VERY SHORTLY BE ANNOUNCING THAT, IN THE LIGHT OF THE LATEST ASSESSMENT OF THE SECURITY SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND ALL OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO ACTIVATE ITS POWERS OF INTERNMENT. THE SECURITY FORCES ARE ACCORDINGLY ARRESTING AND DETAINING PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMITTING OR ABETTING ACTSOF TERRORISM AND OTHER BREACHES OF THE PEACE DESIGNED TO LEAD TO A BREAKDOWN OF LAW ANDORDER IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
2. ARE BANNED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. 
HE WILL AT THE SAME TIME ANOUNCE THAT ALL MARCHES AND PARADES THE BAN WILL BE IN THE FIRST 
INSTANCE FOR SIX MONTHS, BUT IT WILL BE MADE CLEAR THA THE NEED TO EXTEND AND RENEW THE BAN FOR A FURTHER PERIOD WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE SITUATION TOWARDS THE END OF THE PERIOD. 
3. 4. / HE WILL ALSO ANNOUNCE THAT ALL OUTSTANDING APPLICATONS TO 
START RIFLE CLUBS ARE BEING REFUSED, AND THA NO NEW APLICATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED. 
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS IMPOSIBLE TO GIVE NOTICE OF A 
DECISION TOINTRODUCE INTERNMENT BEFORE THE OPERATION TO GIVE EFFECT TO IT. THE SECURITY FORCES HAVE IN FACT BEEN CARRYING OUT SUCH AN OPEATION THIS MORNING. 
5. 
COME TO THECONCLUSION THAT INTERNMENT WAS NOW THE RIGHT AND INDEED INEVITABLE COURSE. 
THE IRA AND THEIR RECENT DECLARATIONS OF THEIR INTENTION TO CONTINUE AND EVEN ESCALATE THEIR CAMPAIGN HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO RESIST THE PRESSURES ON HIM FOR MORE DRASTI ACTION TO ARREST THE DETERIORATION OF MORALE AND THE UNDERMINING OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STABILITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
IN PURELY 
MILITARY TERMS, SEEKING TO CONTAIN THE SITUATION BY THE MEANS EMPLOYED HITHERTO WOULD HAVE MEANT AT BEST A LONG HAUL : AND FAULKNERS JUDGEMENT WAS THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT FOR THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT IS NOW PROPOSED. 
6. 
DECISION IS HIS, THOUGH HE HAS REACHED IT AFTER CONSULTATION WITH US. 
THAT IS HIS JUDGEMENT OF THE SITUATION, AND OF COURSE THE FOR OUR PART, WE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE COULD BE NO 
QUESTION OF OUR ACCEPTING INTERNMENT, AND INSTRUCTING OUR SOURCES TO HELP TO IMPLEMENT IT, IF IT WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY A COMPLETE BAN ON MARCHES AND PARADES OF ALL KINDS: AND WE HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR PRESENT VIEW THAT THAT BAN WILL NEED TO REMAIN IN FORCE FOR LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS THOUGH THE EXTENTION BEYOND SIX MONTHS REMAINS FORMALLY OPEN FOR DISCUSSION. 
7. WE REALISE THAT THESE DECISIONS CARRY THEIR DANGERS AS WELL 
AS THEIR ADVANTAGES FOR NORTHERN IRELAND: AND I AM WELL AWARE OF THEIR IMPLICATIONS AND DANGERS FOR YOU. CLEARLY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND COULD HAVE BEN INCREASED IF YOU HAD FELT ABLE TO TAKE SIMILAR MEASURES ON YOUR SIDE OF THE BORDER. BUT I JUDGED FROMOUR AMBASSADORS REPORT OF HIS RECENT TALK WITH YOU THAT THERE WAS NO PROSPECT OF THAT, AND IC COULD NOT THEREFORE HOLD OUT THIS POSSIBILITY AS AN INDUCEMENT TO FAULKNER TO HOLD HIS HAND. 
8. WE HAVE HOWEVER MADE CLEAR OUR VIEW THAT THE MEASURES 
TAKEN SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE AS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, EXCEPT AS THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION MAKE INEVITABLE. 
AT THE END OF THE MONTH WILL NOT NOW TAKE PLACE. 
COMMITTEE WILL BE SET UP TO WHICH ANYONE WHO IS INTERNED WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE REPRESENTATIONS. 9. 
THERE WILL BE MANY WHO WILL CALL FOR 
THE MARCHES DUE IN DERRY ON 12 AUGUST AND IN BELFAST AN ADVISORY 
I REGRET NO LESS THAN YOU THAT THESE NEW MEASURES HAVE BEEN 
FOUND NECESSARY. I HOPE THAT, IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT I HAVE SAID, U YOU WILL BE ABLE TO REACT TO THEM WITH UNDERSTANDING, EVEN IF WITH REGRET. 
VIOLENT ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THESE MEASURES: A REMINDER FROM YOU THAT VIOLENCE SERVES NO PURPOSE, AND THAT INTERNMENT IS AIMED AGAINST PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAS WHO ARE AVOWEDLY WORKING FOR A BREAKDOWN OF LAW AND ORDER, WOULD BE INVALUABLE. I ALSO HOPE THAT, HOWEVER YOU MAY FEEL OBLIGED TO REACT IN PUBLIC, YOU WILL IN PRACTICE BE ABLE TO KEEP UP THE PRESSURE OF HARASSMENT ON THE IRA SOUTH OF THE BORDER, WHO WILL OF COURSE BE REINFORCED FROM THE NORTH. 
10. OUR HOPE S THAT THESE MEASURES CAN BE STRICTl Y TEMPORARY, WILL SERVE TO REESTABLISH A SITUATION IN WHICH THE MANY SOCIAL. 
AND OTHER REFORMS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AND ARE STILL TO COME ARE RECOGNISED AT THEIR TRUE VALUE, AND WILL NOT PREJUDICE CONTINUING PROGRESS ON THE TASK OF BUILDING MORE HARMONIOUS INTER-COMMUNITY RELATIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
11. AND ABOVE ALL I HOPE THAT THIS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO AFFECT THE GOOD RELATIONSHIP WHIH YOU AND I HAVE ESTABLISHED, AND THE CLOSE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES ON SO MANY MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE TO US BOTH: AND PARTICULARLY ON ENTRY INTO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. 
12. I AM MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR VISIT IN OCTOBER, WHICH WILL GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE WHOLE RANE OF MATTERS OF INTEREST TO US BOTH. 
WHEN FAULKNER CAME TO LONDON LAST WEEK, HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD THE LATEST SERIES OF ACTS OF TERRORISM BY

5. WHEN FAULKNER CAME TO LONDON LAST WEEK, HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT INTERNMENT WAS NOW THE RIGHT AND INDEED INEVITABLE COURSE. THE LATEST SERIES OF ACTS OF TERRORISM BY THE IRA AND THEIR RECENT DECLARATIONS OF THEIR INTENTION TO CONTINUE AND EVEN ESCALATE THAT CAMPAIGN HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO RESIST THE PRESSURES ONHIM FOR MORE DRASTIC ACTION TO ARREST THE DETERIORATION OF MORALE AND THE UNDERMINING OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STABILITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
IN PURELY MILITARY 
TERMS, SEEKING TO CONTAIN THE SITUATION BY THE MEANS EMPLOYED HITHERTO WOULD HAVE MEANT AT BEST A LONG HAUL. 
WAS THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT FOR THE COMUNITY WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT IS NOW PROPOSED. 
ALSO THE FACT THAT THE INTIMIDATION OF THE POPULATION BY THE TERRORISTS HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY HAMPERING THE PROCESS OF GATHERING INTELIGENCE. 
6. 
UNDER WHI H THESE MEASURES ARE TAKEN ARE POWERS OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT. 
THE DECISION IS OF COURSE FAULKNERS, SINCE THE POWERS BUT IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDS UPON THE 
COOPERATION OF THE UNITS OF THE BRITISH ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND HE HAS DECIDED AS HE ALWAYS SAID HE WOULD AFTER CONSULTATION 
WITH US. FOR OUR PART, WE ARE OF COURSE VERY ONCERNED ABOUT 
THE DEGREE TO WHICH OUR FORCES ARE COMMITED IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND THE IMPLICATION OF THAT FOR OUR MILITARY CAPABILITY 
ELSEWHERE. IF THIS MOVE ENABLES US TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TROOPS COMMITTED TO NORTHERN IRELAND EARLIER THAN WE COULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE, THAT WILL BE A WELCOME CONSEQUENCE OF IT. BUT WE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR TO FAULKNER THAT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF OUR ACCEPTING INTERNMENT, AND INSTRUCTING OUR FORCES TO HELP TO IMPLEMENT IT, IF IT WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY A COMPLETE BAN ON MARCHES AND PARADES OF ALL KINDS: AND WE HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR PRESENT VIEW THAT THAT BAN WILL NEED TO REMAIN IN FORCE FOR LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS, ALTHOUGH THE EXTENSION AFTER SIX MONTHS REMAINS FORMALLY OPEN FOR DISCUSSION. 
7. WE REALISE, OF COURSE, THAT THESE DECISIONS CARRY THEIR 
DANGERS AS WELL AS THEIR ADVANTAGES IN NORTHERN IRELAND: AND I AM ALSO VERY WELL AWARE OF THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE IRISH REPUBLIC. 
AT THE END OF THE MONTH WILL NOT TAKE PLACE. THE RIGHT TO MAKE REPRESENTATION. WE HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR VIEW THAT THE MEASUES 
TAKEN SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE AS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, EXCEPT AS THE FACTS OF THE SITUAION MAKE INEVITABLE. 
THE MARCHES DUE IN DERRY ON 12 AUGUST AND IN BELFAST AN ADVISOR 
COMMITTEE WILL BE SET UP, TO WHICH ANYONE WHO IS INTERNED WILL HAVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNMENT 
NORTH OF THE BORDER WOULD BE GREATER IF THE IRISH GOVERNMENT WERE PREPARED TO INTRODUCE INTERNMENT SOUTH OF THE BORDER AT THE SAME TIME: BUT ALL THAT WE KNOW OF THE IRISH GOVERNMENTS POLICIES SUGGEST THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF PARALLEL ACTION SOUTH OF THE BORDER. 
I HAVE HOWEVER SENT A 
MESSAGE TO LYNCH, ASKING HIM TO REACT WITH UNDERSTANDING EVEN IF WITH REGRET TO MAINTAIN THE PRESSURES HE HAS DISCREETLY BEEN EXERTING ON THE IRA SOUTH OF THE BORDER, AND EMPHASISING THAT WE HOPE THAT THESE MEASURES CAN BE STRICTLY TEMPORARY AND WILL NOT PREJUDICE CONTINUING PROGRESS IN THE TASK OF MAKING PROGRESS WITH BUILDING MORE HARMONIOUS INTER-COMMUNITY RELATIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
I HAD ALREADY INVITED LYNCH TO COME OVER 
HERE FOR MEETINGS IN OCTOBER, FOR A GENERAL DISCUSSION ON THE WHOLE RANGE OF MATTERS OF INTEREST TO US BOTH, AND I HOPE VERY MUCH THAT THAT ARRANGEMENT WILL BE ABLE TO STAND.

PRIME MINISTER FROM PETER GREGSON YOU ASKED FOR A FULL TRANSCRIPT OF THE POPE’S REMARKS. 
THE NEXT MESSAGE CONTAINS THE BEST TEXT WHICH OUR MINISTER HAS BEEN ABLE TO SEND SO FAR. WE DO NOT YET HAVE HIS ASSESSMENT BUT THE FCO ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE POPE WAS TRYING QUITE HARD TO BE HELPFUL TO US BY HIS APPEAL FOR PEACE AND BY THE VERY CAREFULLY DRAFTED PHRASING OF HIS, IN THEIR VIEW INEVITABLE, REFERENCE TO INTERNMENT. THEY ARE CONSIDERING WHETHER WE OUGHT TO SEND A FURTHER MESSAGE TO THE POPE. WE ASKED OUR MINISTER TO GIVE HIM A COPY OF THE WHITE PAPER LAST WEEK.

PETER GREGSON FROM PRIME MINISTER CAN YOU LET ME KNOW WHAT THE POSITION IS ABOUT EIRE 
CITIZENSHIP AND UNITED KINGDOM CITIZENSHIP. I ALWAYS FIND THIS A MOST COMPLICATED AND OFTEN 
INCOMPREHENSIBLE SUBJECT. 
UNITED KINGDOM CITIZENS. IS THIS CORRECT? 
SPEAKING, EIRE CITIZENS ARE TREATED THE SAME AS IF SO, IS IT FOR LEGAL REASONS? 
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT, 
OR DOES IT STEM FROM THE SO-CALLED IMPRACTICABILITY OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN EIRE CITIZENS AND UNITED KINGDOM CITIZENS IN NORTHERN IRELAND, INCLUDING ADMISSION TO ENGLAND, SCOTLAND AND WALES?

Political progress in Northern Ireland is bound to be impeded so long as violence and intimidation continue; and the purpose of internment, and of the Army’s measures which are directed impartially at violence from whatever quarter, is to restore to Northern Ireland the necessary degree of stability for further political advance. 
The Border is not at issue. Nor is the constitutional position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom and, within this framework, the principle of democratically elected assembly based on universal adult suffrage. 
But the reform programme which has been and continues to be carried through and to which both the Northern Ireland Government and the United Kingdom Government are fully committed, together with increased opportunities for participation by representatives of the minority on the lines suggested in Mr Faulkner’s recent initiative, have pointed the way forward. In discussion between the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and UK Ministers it was agreed that it would be helpful if the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland were to invite the Home Secretary to arrange as soon as the security situation has sufficiently improved 
talks under his chairmanship with the 
Northern Ireland Government, representatives of both sides of the Northern Ireland Parliament and of all sections of the Northern Ireland community. 
The purpose of these discussions will be to see what further ways and means can be devised, within the constitutional and democratic framework, of giving representatives of the minority as well as of the majority community in Northern Ireland an active and permanent role, guaranteed by the United Kingdom Government, in the processes of government and administration in the Province.

content, unacceptable in its attempt to interfere in the affairs of the United Kingdom, and can in no way contribute to the solution to the problems of Northern Ireland. You should know that the principle of 
equality of treatment for everyone in Northern Ireland irrespective of political views or religion is the accepted policy of the Governments of the United Kingdom and of Northern Ireland and is being fully implemented.

FOLLOWING FOR HENRY JAMES FROM ROBERT ARMSTRONG 
AGREED PRESS BRIEFING AT MEETING BETWEEN UK MINISTERS AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND FOLLOWS. 
YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS TO YOUR NORTHERN IRELAND COLLEAGUE. IT IS AGEED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO GLOSSES . 
THIS IS NOT 
INTENDED AS AN ON-RECORD STATEMENT BUT AS GUIDANCE FOR BRIEFING FOLLOWS. 
THEREIS OF COURSE NO QUESTION OF ANY CHANGE IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
THE OPPORTUNITY 
WAS TAKEN FOR A GENERAL AND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE SECURITY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN NORTHENR IRELAND, AND FOR A WIDE RANGING EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ABOUT POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS AND IDEAS FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND THE RESTORATION OF COMMUNITY HARMONY WITHIN THE EXISTING CONISTUTIONAL FRAMEWORK, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE PERIOD WHEN THE SECURITY SITUATION IS ONCE AGAIN BROUGHT UNER CONTROL. THIS IS TO BE LOOKED UPON AS ONE OF A CONTINUING SERIES OF MEETINGS, DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT A CLOSE LIAISON IS MAINTAINED BETWEEN THE UK GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND.

Current situation The internment operation has been a considerable success technically 
Those detained include a considerable number of both the Goulding and Brady wings of the IRA. The evidence is that both wings have been much more seriously disrupted than statements from IRA sources suggest, and while they will undoubtedly continue to give trouble, there is reasonable hope that, with increased vigilance at the border, terrorist activity wi11 now be at a lower level than in the weeks before internment. 2. 
But internment is only a means to an end: and the political and social consequences have been serious - more serious than many people Is 
Northern Ireland expected. It is too soon to reach conclusions about the permanence of public reaction, but there has undoubtedly been a greater polarisation between the two communities. 3. 
The reaction on the part of the minority to the decision to ban the 
marches, starting with the Apprentice Boys, has been disappointing. We have not done well in the propaganda battle, and the impression has bees widely given that the Army’s role has changed and that it is now there to maintain the dominance of the Unionist majority and to concentrate its attentions on the Roman Catholic minority. 4. 
The morale of moderate Roan Catholics is low and many of those who 
have been giving service to public bodies are wondering whether they can carry on. So far, there has been little response to the civil rights call for strikes, except in Londonderry, and the trade union leadership is trying to counter it. But it will be touch and go; and industrialists are becoming increasingly worried. There is a danger that the recent call for civil disobedience, now officially endorsed by the opposition and supported

DRAFT LETTER FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO MR. LYNCH You wrote to me on 23rd July about the situation in 
Northern Ireland. Your letter has been overtaken by events; and I have now 
had an opportunity to study with care the text of the statement you made last Thursday evening. Let me say at once that I fully understand the pressures 
on you, and recognise your sincere desire for peace and tranquillity for all communities in the North; and I very much welcome your denunciation of violence. But there are features of your statement which I am bound to say I cannot welcome. You spoke of an administration that "is now and has been since it was created directed at the suppression of the civil and human rights of more than a third of the population"; and you add the comment that in the last two years the implementation of the 1969 declaration has been "delayed and distorted". I can see no justification for these accusations. As you 
will know, Mr. Faulkner proposes to publish a White Paper setting out what has been done in Northern Ireland by way of constructive change since 1969, and he has already put out a preliminary account of what has been achieved. May I remind you briefly what this amounts to. The local government franchise was amended to provide for 
one man one vote in November 1969. By-elections have already been held on this basis. The whole of local government was

Ireland Government in the defence of the Province are recognised by continuing arrangements for the fullest consultation as to the policy for the use of the UDR."

FROM ROBERTS 10 DOWNING STREET PLEASE PASS FOLLOWING MESSAGE TO ARMSTRONG IN PRIME MINISTER’S 
DURING THE PRIME MINISTERS CONVERSATION WITH MR FAULKNER A MISUNDERSTANDING AROSE ABOUT INTERNMENT. THE POSITION IS THAT WOODFIELD WAS IN BELFAST TODAY TO PERSUADE FAULKNER NOT TO SIGN THE INTERNMENT CERTIFICATES OVER THE WEEKEND, AND CERTAINLY NOT UNTIL MEMBERSHIP OF THE APPEALS TRIBUNAL HAD BEEN COMPLETED. IT WAS ONLY AFTER WOODFIELD HAD FINISHED HIS MEETINGS IN BELFAST THAT THE HOME SECRETARY MOVED A STAGE FURTHER AND DECIDED THAT THE RIGHT COURSE WAS FOR THE CERTIFICATES NOT TO BE SIGNED UNTIL AFTER THE LYNCH MEETING. IT WAS THIS POSITION WHICH I REPORTED TO THE PRIME MINISTER AT 7 PM. THIS EVENING. AS THE TRANSCRIPT SHOWS, THE PRIME MINISTER SAID TO FAULKNER THAT HE GATHERED THAT WOODFIELD HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH FAULKNER AND THAT HE (THE PRIME MINISTER) HAD HAD ’’A MESSAGE FROM THE HOME SECRETARY TO THAT EFFECT SUGGESTING" THAT INTERNMENT CERTIFICATES SHOULD NOT BE SIGNED UNTIL AFTER THE LYNCH TALKS. FAULKNER INTERPRETED THIS AS MEANING THAT WOODFIELD HAD SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD NOT PROCEED WITH INTERNMENT UNTIL AFTER THE TALKS: AND POINTED OUT (CORRECTLY) 
THAT THIS WAS NOT THE POSITION DISCUSSED 
WITH WOODFIELD. IT IS STILL THE VIEW OF BURKE AND WADDELL (TO WHOM I HAVE EXPLAINED HOW THE MISUNDERSTANDING AROSE) THAT WE SHOULD NOT GO FURTHER ON INTERNMENT BEFORE THE LYNCH TALKS. WADDELL WILL BE REPORTING TO THE HOME SECRETARY, WHO MAY WELL TRY TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OVER THE WEEKEND TO SUGGEST A FURTHER APPROACH TO FAULKNER. THERE IS, I THINK, NO DANGER THAT THE INTERNMENT CERTIFICATES WILL BE SIGNED BEFORE MONDAY AT THE EARLIEST, BUT ALL CONCERNED ARE AWARE OF THE NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY. MESSAGE ENDS.

I have been thinking about the form of the statement which we might hope to issue at the and of next week’s tripartite meeting. 
which one writes at this stage can he worth very much; but the attempt to put some words on paper sometimes helps to sort out idea and to define the limits of what is possible as well as desirable. Because the attached is only a first cock-shy draft I have not shown it at this stake to anybody else. In preparing it I have been influenced by:- 
(a) A feeling that it reads better in the first person. than in the third. This 
has the incidental advantage of avoiding any reed to refer to Mr. Faulkner as a "Prime Minister"; but more important, I think - it helps to give the statement a greater degree of conviction in so for as the text represents what three men, after some pretty difficult differences as individuals, nevertheless feel that they can say in common. (b) The need to steer clear of any detailed formulation or discussion of 
possible changes at Stormont, This is a matter fco the Home Secretary’s discussions, not for the Chequers meeting; and, if the Northern Treland Government’s Green Paper is published more or less simultaneously with that meeting, the substance of their offer will be clear enough. The Chequers communique, on the other hand, should be as statesmanlike a document as possible, frankly recognising (while not spelling out in detail) the basic differences between the three Governments but insisting that a solution must the found by a peaceful process of political reconciliation and that in the interim law and order must be maintained. (c) Dublin telegram No. 427 of 20th September, in which Sir John Peck indicates Mr. Lynch’s probable objectives at Chequers 
This merely confirms 
that, as we already knew, the Chequers meeting sill consist essentially of our bargaining our insistence that Mr. Lynch must at least commend the Home Secretary’s discussions and take a tougher line with the IRA against Mr. Lynch’s wish to participate in the Home Secretary’s discussions and to secure some easing of internment. It is impossible to say how the final balance will be struck; in the meanwhile the passages in square brackets may serve to indicate the minimum which we must try to achieve. 
If we can get more, so much the better. But you may have very different ideas about the form and content of the 
statement. And in any event it will have to be scrapped entirely if the meeting turns out unfavourably! 
I doubt whether anything

DRAFT MINUTE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER HOME SECRETARY 
Northern Ireland: Direct Rule We cannot tell how things will go after next 
week’s tripartite meeting at Chequers. But on one hypothesis we might find ourselves compelled to move to direct rule fairly soon thereafter. 
I should 
like to be sure that,if so our plans are as ready as they can be in terms of the legislation, the appointment of key personnel, the provision of secure communications, the intensification of security and intelligence measures, and so forth. 
I believe 
also that we have hitherto based our planning on an assumption that in circumstances of direct rule we could continue to rely on the loyalty of the RUC and the public service in Northern Ireland. But suppose that that assumption proved to be invalid. Have we alternative plans ready? I should be grateful if you would look into this 
matter personally and let me know whether anything further remains to be done.

These ideas are based on the assumption that I open the debate, 
though, no doubt, the material I ask for will be useful to the Prime Minister if he should decide to do so instead. I should like to make my starting point the Downing Street 
Declaration. I believe we can claim this ha been carried out in full. The Northern Ireland White Paper seems all the briefing necessary on the assumption that we accept its accuracy. It would be useful to have any 
quotations from Labour spokesmen which indicate that at the time they thought this programme would deal wiTh discrimination, and whether they think it has been faithfully carried out. It is important to make the point that the reaction of the minority 
has been disappointing, and is might be worth referring to speeches in other countries which cloud the issue by minimising what has been done, and is being done. 
I think it is important to get the chronology right since the 
present Government took office, and a table with just the major events would be helpful. 
If I remember correctly, there was a considerable improvement 
in the situation for a time after Faulkner took over, but that this worsened again when the I.R.A. deliberately stepped up their campaign. 
Is there 
evidence to support this, and the belief that the I.R.A. acted in this manner largely because things were quietening down? I should like timing and some details of Faulkner’s initiative on 
the Parliamentary Committees and the withdrawal of the Opposition from Stormont.

I HAVE REFRESHED MY MEMORY ON THE PAPERS RELATING TO 
MAJOR CHICHESTER-CLARK’S RESIGNATION LAST MARCH TO ASSESS E VALIDITY OF THE ASSERTIONS MADE YESTERDAY BY ROBIN CHICHESTER-CLARK. 
HE MADE TWO KEY ASSERTIONS: 
BE (IE) LORD MOYOLA) RESIGNED BECAUSE HE WANTED SPECIFIC SWIFT ACTION TAKEN AGAINST THE IRA BEFORE THEY GAINED IN NUMBERS AND STRENGTH TO TERRORISE AND PARALYSE THE COMMUNITY. HIS REQUIREMENTS WERE THOUGHT TOO. DIFFICULT MILITARILY LAST 
MARCH. 
WAS NO DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR EFFECT IVE ACTION AGAINST THE IRA. 
NEITHER OF THESE TwO STATEMENTS IS CORRECT. THERE THERE WAS ALSO AGREEMENT ON CERTAIN Of 
THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES WHICH LORD MOYOLA WANTED E.G. ACTIVE PURUSIT AND HARRASSMENT OF THE TERRORISTS AND MORE CORDONING. BUT ONE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL, THE STATIONING OF TROOPS IN CATHOLIC ENCLAVES WAS REJECTED. 
THIS WAS NOT BECAUSE IT 
WAS ’’MILITARILY DIFFICULT’’ BUT BECAUSE IT WAS MILITARILY UNSOUND, IN THAT TYING DOWN TROOPS IN STATIC AND VERY POSITIONS, WOULD REDUCE RATHR THAN INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EFFORT AGAINST THE IRA. IT 
IT WAS ALSO THOUGHT THAT WO 
WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON COMMUNITY HARMONY, WHI" IN TURN REACT ADVERSELY ON THE SECURITY SITUATION 
LORD MOYOLA UNDERSTOOD THIS PERFECTLY WELL. HE ACCENTED THAT THE STATIONING OF TROOPS IN CATHOLIC AREAS WOULD BE MILITARILY UNSOUND BUT PERISSTED UP TO AND INCLUDING LORD CARRINGTON’S LAST MEETING WITH HIM ON 20 MARCH, IN ASKING FOR THIS TOBE DONE FOR POLITICAL REASONS. HE DID NOT HOWEVER MAKE THE ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PROPOSAL THE CONDITION FOR HIS CONTINUANCE IN OFFICE. RATHER HE GAVE US TO UNDERSTAND THAT HIS MAIN REASON FOR RESIGNING WAS THAT ME WAS 
HIM. 
EXHAUSTED AND THAT THE JOB HAD BECOME TOO DIFFICULT FOR HE IS RECORDED ON THE RECORD OF LORD CARRINGTON’S 
LAST MEETING WITH HIM AS HAVING SAID ’’HE COULD NOT CHALLENGE THE PROFESSIONAL RIGHTNESS OF THE ARMY’S METHODS BUT TIME HAD RUN OUT FOR HIM AND HE WOULD HAVE TO GO’’.

2. BUT IT WAS AGREE 
THAT T E IDEA WOULD BE EXPLORED TO SEE WHETHER IT MADE MILITARY SENSE. 
SUBSEQUENTLY, PROBABLY ON THURSDAY 18 MARCH, GOC MADE IT 
CLEAR T LORD MOYOLA IN BELFAST THAT ARMY’S CONSIDERED VIEW WAS THAT ’’ENCLAVE’’ PROPOSAL WAS MILITARILY UNSOUND. 
3. ON AFTERNOON OF FRIDAY 19 MARCH LORD MOYOLA TOLD YOU ON THE TELEPHONE THAT HE WAS GOING TO RESIGN BECAUSE HIS PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVING THE SECURITY SITUATION HAD NOT BEEN ACCEPTED. YOU SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED THIS ASSERTION. 
YOU TOLD HiM HIM 
THAT HE HAD ACCEPTED THE VIEW THAT IN DECIDING WHAT TO DO ABOU THE IRA WE SHOULD DO WHAT MADE SENSE MILTARILY. RECONSIDER THE CONTENTS OF

Draft of a statement to be issued by No 10 after Mr Faulkner’s visit 
The British Government have decided to raise the strength of the 
Army in Northern Ireland by three battalions. These extra forces will be at the tactical disposal of the GOC to be used as he thinks fit, but their arrival will enable him, among other things, to strengthen control of the border and to follow up more rapidly the action against terrorists made possible by the increased flow of information which is coming into the Army’s hands. 2. 
By agreement with the Government of Northern Ireland the British 
Government have authorised the GOC to take immediate measures to block a number of border roads and to restrict the passage of vehicles on others. This will unavoidably result in some inconvenience to people living in the border areas but it is a necessary step in the campaign to prevent the movement of terrorists, arms and explosives. 3.

1. On 1 October, the Ministry of Development estimated that 20 per cent of the population of Northern Ireland (rather over half the Catholic population) were taking part in the civil disobedience campaign; in some areas over 90 per cent of the population were involved. When a high proportion of the population is involved, some intimidation is probably occuring. There has been little significant increase in the numbers involved over the past fortnight but the Government is afraid that, unless firm action is taken quickly, Protestants will also decline to pay rent and rates leading to a rapid decline in the situation. 2. The principal provisions of the Bill due to be debated in Stormont on 7 October are i. 
Section 1 empowers Government Departments or public bodies to 
withhold payment owing to individuals or their wives (if they are living together) and to pay the money instead to Departments or public bodies to whom the person owes money; ii. Section 2 empowers the Ministry of Development to impose interest on outstanding rent or rates; iii. Sections 3, 4. and 8 empower Masters of the Courts to make emergency orders for attaching earnings of people owing money to Government Departments or public bodies to cover the debts together with the costs and expenses of enforcement; iv. Section 10 enables the Master to dispense with normal service of emergency orders if this is impracticable; v. 
Section 9 provides for appeals against orders which, however, 
remain in force pending the appeal; and vi. Section 11 provides that employers who fail to comply with attachment orders shall themselves become liable for the debt (and therefore for recovery under the Bill).

2. The Northern Ireland Situation 
The attached report assessing the Northern Ireland situation until the end of 1971 remains valid. Its very general conclusion was that, while political progress by the end of the year was not impossible, and an improvement in the security situation could not be ruled out, it was more likely that violence would continue on roughly the present scale, thus hardening the divisions between Catholics and Protestants and further narrowing the basis for any political settlement. Events since the report was written have reinforced that general conclusion on the side of pessimism. 
There are some points on which the report needs to be brought up to date: a. 
The tripartite talks at Chequers showed that Faulkner and 
Lynch recognised that they still had some community of interest, if only in opposing the use of violence in the North. The fact that the meeting took place may at first have done something to temper the general expectation in Northern Ireland that the situation could only get worse. But the continuing violence has lead to Protestant discontent that nothing has been gained. 
b. Both Lynch and Faulkner have their political problems. Lynch 
has to contend with heavy criticism of his moderate policies within his own Cabinet and from former members of his party. Faulkner has exposed himself to Unionist criticism for being willing to consider concessions to the Catholics. Both men have so far kept their nerve but have very little room for manoeuvre. 
c. Within Northern Ireland the major opposition party - the Social 
Democratic and Labour Party - continues in its refusal to discuss reforms. The party has become increasingly committed to the demand that internment should end before political progress can be made. They are fearful of losing support in the Catholic community to the IRA if they are seen to co-operate with the Stormont Government or with Westminister.

Belfast Telno 52 Para 6 "There should be a standing commission to watch

In the grave situation which now exists it is 
more than ever important that the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland Governments should form a common view of the situation and work together by agreed means to the vital end of restoring peace and stability. This being the case our contacts at the very highest level must be close and regular. For this reason I will be going to London on Thursday for further discussions with Mr. Heath and his senior colleagues on every aspect of the current situation. In particular I will be able to discuss the security arrangements in the light of Lord Carrington’s visit last week and his report on such matters as border security, the accelerated recruitment of the U.D.R. and the necessary firm response to new developments in the terrorist campaign.

Compton Report Draft Statement by the Home Secretary 1. The Report of the Committee under the chairmanship of 
Sir Edmund Compton which I set up to inquire into allegations against the security forces of physical brutality in Northern Ireland arising out of events on 9th August is being published today and copies /will be available in the Vote Office at 4 p.m.] 2. 
The Government are grateful to the members of the Committee of 
Inquiry for the care and thoroughness with which they carried out their difficult task. 3.

report is published with an introduction by myself as Minister appointing that inquiry. 4.

I think the House on studying the Report will conclude that this I made it clear to the Committee on the day they were appointed 
that their terms of reference included complaints of physical brutality in respect of a small number of men arrested on 9th August who were interrogated in depth after a detention order had been made against them. The purpose of this interrogation was to obtain vital information about the terrorist forces and their stocks of arms and explosives. 
In 
these cases also the Committee found no evidence of physical brutality or of torture or of brain-washing.

(1) Were the interrogation techniques described in the Compton Report

Advice was given, based upon the principles which have governed interrogation in the emergencies of this kind in which the United Kingdom has been involved under Governments of both Parties. These principles are described in the Government note quoted in paragraph 46 of the Compton Report. 
(b) Following the decision of the Northern Ireland Government, after consultation with Her Majesty’s Government, to exercise powers of detention and internment where necessary, the formal authority for the removal of certain individuals from the place specified in their detention orders to the interrogation centre was given by the Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs. Interrogation was authorised by the Northern Ireland Government with the knowledge and concurrence of Her Majesty’s Government. 
(c) The RUC were in charge of the interrogation centre. But Army personnel were present at the centre in an advisory capacity; and for practical purposes the interrogation was a joint operation.

1. A. 
Does the Government accept the Compton Report? The Government welcome the Committee’s findings that none of 
those who were arrested on 9 August were subject to physical brutality by the security forces, much less torture or brainwashing. The Government have taken note that in a relatively small number of cases the Committee concluded that some of those arrested suffered a measure of physical ill-treatment. 
Most of the cases in which the Committee considered some physical ill-treatment had occurred related to the process of 
interrogation, and in the light of the Committee’s report, the Government are inviting 3 Privy Counsellors to examine, and provide authoritative advice on,the procedures for the interrogation of persons suspected of involvement in a terrorist campaign, including their custody while subject to interrogation, and on the application of those procedures. I would however emphasise what the Hoe Secretary said in his preface to the Report about the difficulty of implementing the rules in detail in circumstances in which rigorous and intensive interrogation is vitally and urgently necessary. 
As for the handful of cases where the Compton Committee thought 
that people suffered ill-treatment at the time of arrest or at a Regional Holding Centre - for example, the case of Mr. Cummings who was hooded and bound as a military precaution -, I can only say that it speaks volumes for the discipline and common sense of the many soldiers who were engaged in this large-scale and dangerous operation in which a total of 342 arrests were made that there were so very few cases of this kind and that when they did occur, on no occasion, in the Committee’s view, was ill-treatment deliberate. 
2. 
Will any disciplinary action be taken in respect of any cases where Compton concluded there had been ill-treatment? Is the Secretary of State for Defence satisfied that this report exonerates the Army? 
A. As was indicated in paragraph 18 of the Home Secretary’s 
preface to the Compton Report, the Government do not regard the Committee’s findings as in any way reflecting adversely on the responsibility and discipline with which the security forces in Northern Ireland are conducting their fight against a vicious and ruthless enemy. So far as the military forces for which HMG are responsible are concerned the repo t does not appear to indicate any circumstances in which disciplinary action would be appropriate. 
It is worth pointing out that it was only in the case of 19 
persons out of a total of 342 arrested that the Compton Committee found any evidence of physical ill-treatment and that in 8 of those cases - 
/small 
those which were concerned ith the handling of suspects at the time of arrest and at Regional Holding Centres - such ill- 
treatment as there was could in no way be regarded as deliberate or as part of the routine for handling prisoners. These are remarkably

ANNEX 1. On 31 August 1971, I appointed a Committee of Inquiry under the 
chairmanship of Sir Edmund Compton, GCB, KBE, with His Honour Edgar Fay, QC, and Dr Ronald Gibson, CBE, as members, with the following terms of reference:"To investigate allegations by those arrested on 9 August under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 of physical brutality while in the custody of the security forces prior to either their subsequent release, the preferring of a criminal charge or their being lodged in a place specified in a detention order". 
2. The Committee of Inquiry visited Northern Ireland from 
1 September until 26 October and have now sent me their report which is published in this Command Paper. The Situation in Northern Ireland 3. 
In considering the Committees report it is important to 
have in mind the circumstances in Northern Ireland in which the Northern Ireland Government decided to exercise their powers under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 to arrest, detain or intern persons suspected of having acted or being about to act in a manner prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or the maintenance of order. 4. 
At the beginning of February this year the IRA began to increase 
the ferocity of their well-established campaign of violence. A marked increase in intensity occurred in July, and has been maintained up to the present time. 
This campaign of murder and intimidation has included 
gun attacks on military and police patrols, explosive attacks on offices and buildings, together with indiscriminate bombing of occupied buildings in the cities, killing and injuring members of the general public. More recently there has been a concerted attack on individual police officers, police premises and the homes of police officers. Since [June 1972] 87 civilians, 11 members of the RUC and 38 members of the Armed

In dealing with a terrorist campaign such as that in Northern Ireland, 
intelligence is the key to successful operations, and the key to intelligence is information regarding the operations, dispositions, and plans of the terrorists. Her Majesty’s Government accordingly acceded to a request from the Government of Northern Ireland to assist the RUC in setting up an interrogation centre. Advice was given, based upon the principles which have governed interrogation in the emergencies of this kind in which Britain has been involved under Governments of both parties. These principles are described in the Government note quoted in paragraph 46 of the Compton Report. 
2. Following the decision of the Northern Ireland Government; after 
consultation with Her Majesty’s Government, to exercise powers of detention and internment where necessary, the formal authority for the removal of certain individuals from the place specified in their detention orders to the interrogation centre was given by the Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs. 
Interrogation was authorised by the Northern 
Ireland Government with the knowledge and acquiescence of Her Majesty’s Government. 
3. The RUC were in charge of the interrogation centre, but Army 
personnel were present at the centre in an advisory capacity, and for practical purposes the interrogation was a joint operation. 
4. The methods employed were approved in principle by Ministers of 
both Governments; but their detailed application was necessarily a matter for the judgment of those concerned locally.

The Committee’s Findings 12. I asked the Committee to adopt procedures which were designed to protect the lives of those who had conducted the arrests and interrogations against the risk of retaliation. Every individual who believed that he had grounds of complaint had the opportunity to put his case forward and was assured of a full and impartial hearing. 
Only one man did so. and concorroborated allegations. 
For the rest, it was a matter of unsubstantiated The Committee carried out 
a thorough examination of the evidence, both oral and documentary, put forward by members of the security forces. In the great majority of cases, given the lack of supporting evidence for the allegations, the Committee themselves have felt unable to carry the matter any further; but in the Government’s view the balance of credibility is clear. 13. 
The allegations which the Committee have examined fall 
broadly into two classes, those relating to the initial arrests and a small number concerned with the subsequent process of interrogation. 
it is clear from the report that there were very few complaints and those there were had, in the Committee’s view, very little substance. 
As regards the initial arrests, The record of events reflects 
great credit on the security forces, who carried out a difficult and dangerous operation in adverse circumstances with commendable restraint and discipline. 
As regards the allegations relating to 11 cases during the subsequent period 
of interrogation, the Committee found no evidence of physical brutality, still less of torture or brain-washing; and there is no medical evidence of physical or mental injury. Their 
findings about physical ill-treatment do however, raise certain questions about the detailed application of the general rules governing interrogation.

PRISONER HANDLING IN INTERROGATION CENTRES NORTHERN IRELAND REPORT BY THE INTELLIGENCE CO-ORDINATOR 
Minutes of the Meeting of Ministers (GEN.47(71)6th Meeting 
18 October) instructed the Intelligence Co-ordinator "in consultation with officials of the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Services, to make an immediate assessment of the methods of interrogation suitable for use in Northern Ireland." In accordance with the above instructions the Intelligence 
Co-ordinator recommends as follows:1. 
That the handling of detainees and their subsequent 
interrogation in Northern Ireland should continue to be governed by the general principles laid down in JIC(65)15 and amendment dated 10 February 1967. 
[Annexes A and B respectively.] 2. The responsibility for all prisoner handling and 
interrogation methods employed at the special interrogation centre should rest with a senior police supervising officer. The role of military officers attached to the centre should be purely advisory. 3. 
There should be substantial evidence of a detainee’s 
involvement in terrorist activities before he is selected for protracted interrogation at the special interrogation centre.

1. The general rules governing the custody of detainees and the 
processes of interrogation have been reviewed from time to time by the Government Departments and agencies concerned in the light of experience gained in the various internal security operations in which HMG have been involved since the last war. The techniques of interrogation currently in use have also been employed in manY Previous internal security situations. The latest instructions on the rules to be followed were issued in 1965, and were revised in 1967 to provide for the daily inspection by a medical officer in the light of the recommendations in the Report on the Aden situation by Mr Roderic Bowen Q.C. issued in November 1966 (Cmd 3165). 2. 
These general rules include the following safeguards: a. 
b. c. Subjects to be seen daily by a Medical Officer. 
The following are prohibited: (i) 
Violence to life and person, in particular, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture. 
(ii) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment. 
d. 
Subjects are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline. 
(These rules follow the broad principles for the treatment of persons under arrest or detention during civil disturbances as laid down in Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative 
to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949)). 3. The precise application of these general rules in particular 
circumstances is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the part of those immediately responsible for the operations in question. Intelligence is the key to successful operations against 
Medical examination and record of weight of subject on admission and discharge.

INTERROGATION TRAINING 
Summary of Background leading up to Interrogation in depth in N.I. August, 1971. 
1. The Bowen Report recommended amongst other things 
that after Aden future interrogations in IS/COIN ops should be undertaken by Civilians. 2. 
for guidance. 
As a result DMSI minuted DUS(P) on 2 May 1968 asking AUS(Pol) on behalf of DUS(P) replied that 
we must handle situations of this kind case by case. DMSI, in reply to a query from the Inspector of Intelligence wrote in February 1969, that because there was no other source the Army would probably have to undertake interrogation in IS situations as FCO had NOT accepted responsibility. 3. 
The JSIW thus continued as the only official venue 
for "Interrogation Training" and as such has NOT only trained Service personnel but Metropolitan Police (SB), and - the request of FCO - SB officers from various Commonwealth 
at 
countries including the Crown Colony of Hong Kong. The Training Phase 4. 
First intimation of a request for training was in a 
telephone message from Brennan (NI) to Evans DI1 on 17 March 1971. 5. 
At a meeting on 24 March 1971 the implications of an 
Interrogation Centre were discussed in MOD with representatives of the Security Service. 
Thereafter MOD despatched Nicholson

NORTHERN IRELAND: INQUIRY INTO ALLEGATIONS OF BRUTALITY 
The Prime Minister spoke this morning to 
Sir Edmund Compton on the telephone and persuaded him to take part in the inquiry into allegations of brutality arising from the internment operation. Sir Edmund said that he would need to be assured 
that the inquiry which he was carrying out for Lord Balniel on Defence Medical Services could be suspended until this more urgent task was completed. The Prime Minister said that he would arrange for this to be done. He would also clear the appointment with Mr. Faulkner, in view of Sir Edmund’s capacity as Parliamentary Commissioner for Northern Ireland and with the Secretary of State for the Environment, whom he would be seeing at Worcester, in view of Sir Edmund’s forthcoming work on local government boundaries. The Prime Minister explained that there would 
be two other members, a lawyer and a doctor. Sir Edmund suggested that Mr. Owen Stable, Q.C., would be a good choice. The Prime Minister undertook to pursue this. The Prime Minister asked Sir Edmund whether he 
would be willing to preside over the inquiry. Sir Edmund said that he had thought that the three members could work together, but he would be willing to preside if the Prime Minister wanted this. The Prime Minister undertook to let him know.

NORTHERN IRELAND Background for Briefing The British Government deliberately did not react 
to Mr. Lynch’s first statement demanding that "Stormont must go", in the hope of not increasing tension in Northern Ireland 
still further inflaming the position 
in the South. But it was impossible for the Government not to react to the telegram which Mr. Lynch sent to the Prime Minister yesterday, with its reference to the encouragement of passive resistance, particularly in relation to its timing, when the Prime Minister and Mr. Faulkner were holding a meeting the whole purpose of which was to look forward to the possibilities or reducing tension and improving community relations in Northern Ireland, once the security situation had become more normal. 
The tone of the message was particularly regrettable 
when Mr. Lynch knew that the meeting which had already been arranged could be brought forward if he wanted it to be: he only had to ask. At the meeting with Mr. Faulkner, Ministers covered 
the whole ground. They discussed arrangements for dealing with the terrorists. They discussed the allegations of brutality by the Armed Forces. It was made clear that arrangements for participation by the Opposition which had been offered by Mr. Faulkner still stood. Ministers discussed how the communities could be brought to live together more amicably and how participation of the minority could be a full and guaranteed reality when the security situation became more normal.
