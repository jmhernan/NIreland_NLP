UPDATING POINTS FOR HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY AS AT FRIDAY 6 OCTOBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
The rise in IRA activity shows signs of continuing. There were 13 
bomb incidents and 48 shootings, one of which was an attempt on the life of Mr Craig. 
CASUALTIES 2. MIL - 
9 injured (2 VSI) 
CIV - 2 killed (intersectarian) - IRA - 2 hits claimed. 
ARRESTS 3. 
FINDS 4. 
6 injured (1 intersectarian) Only routine ones made, except James TRAINOR (Adjt A Coy 3 Bn Provo). Some 8 weapons, assorted ammunition and explosive. 
IRA ACTIVITY 5. 
A bomb went off without warning in a Catholic Bar killing one and wounding 
several. 13 bomb attacks were spread throughout the Province but shootings mainly confined to city areas, though there were a couple of cross border shooting incidents. 
6. 7. An explosion successfully ut off electrical power to most of County 
Fermanagh. This is the first really successful ’black out’ resulting from many attacks on the supply system during the last year. 
Intimidation against individual members of the Press continues. 
PROTESTANT ACTIVITY 8. 
Credence to reports of Protestant attacks on isolated Catholic families 
living in Protestant areas are strengthened by the murder of a young Catholic at his home in Portadown. A grenade is believed to have been thrown through the window. 
9. Parties of UDA called on householders in Lisburn and ordered them to 
handover their PR voting forms which they then tore up. The UDA were masked and cudgelled. 
10. Overt UDA activity continues in East Belfast. An MRF vehicle was forcibly stopped by a group of UDA on the Newtonards Road at 0105 hrs 5 Oct. One soldier is VSI with compound skull fractures resulting from a brick being thrown through the windscreen. His pistol was stolen.

MINISTRY OF DEFENCE - CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX TO 
COS 34TH MEETING/72 HELD ON TUESDAY 28 NOVEMBER 1972 AT 2.45 pm 
ITEM 2. 1. SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND SIR PETER HILL-NORTON invited the Chief of the General 
Staff to bring them up to date on the situation in Northern Ireland. 
2. SIR MICHAEL CARVER then outlined the course of events 
since the beginning of Operation MOTORMAN on 31 July. This Operation could be regarded as being completed by the end of November but there would be no let up in the Army’s arrest policy and intelligence effort. There was however a need to redefine the role of the Army and he hoped that the new directive he had prepared for the GOC would be cleared by Ministers before 1 December. He went on to describe the general situation and the political hurdles to be overcome during the coming year. On the security front there were grounds for cautious optimism and he thought that a total of 18 units in the infantry role, temporarily reinforced during periods of increased tension, would be the minimum force level likely to be needed. To reduce overstretch of BAOR units, the Secretary of State had agreed to authorise the use of the two Irish cavalry regiments in the infantry role in UNFICYP for one six-month tour each from November 1973. In addition it was hoped to include the three Medium Regiments RA in BAOR, one at a time, in the roulement plot for Northern Ireland duties starting in October 1973. He expressed his appreciation for the continuing assistance being given to the Army by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. 
3. SIR PETER HILL-NORTON said that they were grateful to 
the Chief of the General Staff for his statement. They would take note of his decision to employ the Irish Regiments in UNFICYP and SACEUR would have to be informed of this in due course. However the timing of notification to SACEUR of the

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office are, I think, 
aware from Scott’s letter to Brooke Turner dated 23 October 1972 and discussions with the Defence Secretariat (DS 11) that we have been considering deploying Irish regiments of the Royal Armed Corps to UNFICYP in an infantry role. 
Our reasons for this 
are twofold: first, the exclusion of these regiments from service in Northern Ireland makes them anxious to be seen to be doing their share of unaccompanied service; and secondly, their addition to the number of units available for the Cyprus duty will of course help to relieve the Army’s overstretch and the resulting turbulence. 
Dragoon Guards and the Queen’s Royal Irish Hussars, both of which are at present serving in BAOR. 
the rear parties which would be left behind to look after tanks and other equipment, the strength of these regiments when deployed in UNFICYP is likely to be respectively 430 and 440 all ranks. 
Three questions seem to arise; the NATO aspect, 
the UN aspect, and the relevance of this proposal to the separate discussions in progress about reducing the size of the UN force. 
There probably will not be any Taking the last two together, I 
believe that we ought to try to keep the proposal quite separate from the question of a reduction of UNFICYP force levels. 
difficulty from the UN about the principle of employing dismounted armoured regiments in the infantry role and I believe there is already a precedent in the Canadians’ recent similar use of Lord Strathcona’s Horse. So far as the strength of the two RAC units is concerned, any reduction in numbers is to be seen not as a deliberate reduction in force levels but as a temporary expedient occurring for two periods of six months between November 1973 and May 1975. 
The numbers will 
admittedly be nearly 200 below the strength of the average infantry battalion on UNFICYP tours, but will be only some 90 below the level we would normally regard as the minimum for this duty. 
The operational capability of

NOTE FOR THE RECORD r. John Lynch, the Taoiseach of the Irish Republic, 
who was accompanied by the Irish Ambassador, Dr. Donal O’Sullivan, came to see the Prime Minister, who was accompanied by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Sir Burke Trend and Mr. R.T.Armstrong, at 10 Downing Street on the evening of Friday, 24 November 1972. 
Mr. Lynch said that he felt that affairs in Northern 
Ireland had reached a point where there was a real possibility of favourable development. He had already declared in public his Government’s welcome for the British Government’s discussion paper on the future of Northern Ireland. The Irish Government read that paper as closing the door against either a unilateral declaration of independence by Northern Ireland, or complete integration with Great Britain, or a return to the Stormont system as it was before direct rule was introduced. He hoped that the proposals which the British Government eventually put forward would include provisions for a Council of Ireland. If the proposals were to be acceptable to the Government of the Republic, it would be important that they should be seen to be a basis for further evolution in the direction of a united Ireland. He envisaged that

NIOM 72 (49 NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NOON ON FRIDAY 24 NOVEMBER 1. Plebiscite and White Paper 
The Northern Ireland (Border Poll) Bill had received third reading in the Commons early on 24 November. In the debate, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had kept open all options on the relative timing of the White Paper and the Plebiscite. A paper was being prepared on this for GEN 79 the following week. 
2. Security in Border Areas 
GEN 79 would also consider a paper the following week on the documentation of vehicles in border areas. It was noted that the implementation of any such scheme would require very much higher force levels being available to operate vehicle checks, and that this disadvantage was an overriding one. 
Detention Figures 
The ratio of ex-internees being detained by the Commissioners to those being released was running at about 2:1.33 had been detained and 19 released out of the 52 cases referred so far. 
3. GOC’s Draft Directive 
It was noted that the CGS had prepared a new directive to the GOC on Post Motorman objectives. The possibility of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland issuing a broad directive for release to the press on Her Majesty’s Government’s security objectives in Northern Ireland was discussed, but the disadvantage of this was that it might be construed as a corrective in the light of recent allegations against the Army by Catholic priests. 
4. Propaganda against the Army 
It was agreed that Ministry of Defence should let Foreign and Commonwealth Office have information urgently to counter the allegations made by the Catholic priests so that Foreign and Commonwealth Office might brief posts abroad. 
Various ways of countering propaganda against the Army were discussed. Ministry of Defence would investigate further the possibilities of: 
i. Disproving specific allegations by conducting their own disciplinary enquiries. 
The difficulty in doing so was that most allegations because they had been so magnified for propaganda purposes, raised questions of criminal liability, and these had to be referred to the civil authorities. 
ii. Producing recordings and film to illustrate the abuse and violence to which troops were subjected by IRA women sympathisers, and the restraint which troops showed in such circumstances.

24 November 1972 
Dear Mr. Cosgrave, Thank you for your letter of 10 November in 
which you expressed concern about the decision to hold a poll in Northern Ireland on the issue of the Border. The intention to hold such a plebiscite was, as 
you know, first set out in my statement in the House of Commons on 24 March which also announced the decision to suspend the Northern Ireland Government. I considered it essential to find some way of taking the Border out of everyday politics. The obsession with this issue over the past fifty years has made it virtually impossible for normal exchanges on other political issues in Northern Ireland to develop in a healthy way. The fact that the result of the poll is widely 
regarded as a foregone conclusion has led to a belief in some quarters that the decision to hold it is a concession to extreme Unionist opinion. Nothing is further from the truth; and indeed some other parties in Northern Ireland are strongly in favour of the poll being held. The decision was made last March, and the reasons for it have not changed. I have made it clear that the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland must

Address by the Taoiseach, Mr. J. Lynch, to the Oxford Union Society on 23rd November 1972. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
I ask you to support the motion before this House, "That this House would favour Irish unity". 
Thirteen years ago, another Irish Prime Minister, my immediate predecessor, the late Sean Lemass, spoke from this same rostrum. His speech was an appeal for greater practical co-operation between North and South in Ireland, leading, he hoped, to eventual unity by agreement. address, he said: 
In the course of his 
"You may ask: Why not leave the situation as it is? Whatever emotional appeal the unity of Ireland may have for you, why not accept the fact of Partition, forget its dubious origins, and concentrate on the social and economic progress of the rest of the island - the part which is under your own jurisdiction"? 
Mr. Lemass answered this question by saying simply that 
"nothing is ever settled until it is settled right". To many in his audience that answer may have seemed unrealistic. Today, however, that answer can be seen to be very much to the point. 
I will suggest to you tonight that any settlement, to be "right", must provide for a beginning of movement towards unity in Ireland; and that a settlement which encourages, not immediate unity, but growth in this direction, by agreement, would be in the best interests of Britain and of all of the people of Ireland, North and South. 
To understand why this is necessary, it is first important to appreciate

There ere various incidents of crowds seeking SF during the day to cause disturbances, particularly in the Ardoyne where on one occasion as a strong SF patrol was passing the Saunders Club Elmfield Street, 150 to 200 hooligans came out, apparently at a signal, and began bottling and stoning the troops. 11 baton rounds were fired in this incident. 
LONDONDERRY 3. 
There was 1 shooting incident when a shot was fired at a patrol

THE PRIME MINISTER On the 25th October (CM(72) 46th Conclusions, Minute 4, 
Confidential Annex) I told the Cabinet that I was considering whether there were good grounds for prosecuting Mr. Craig in respect of the speech he had recently made to the Monday Club. 
I have now examined all available press reports of the speech, 
and I have considered whether these reports reveal that Mr. Craig may have committed any criminal offence, including treason felony, sedition and incitement to commit a criminal offence. If prosecutions were to be instituted in respect of those offences it would be open to the defence to argue that in his speech Mr. Craig was proposing a course of conduct only in the event of a certain (unhoped for) situation arising; and that in the particular circumstances in which the speech was delivered there was no intention to incite the audience. I am satisfied that this defence would be likely to succeed. 
I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that criminal 
proceedings would not be justified, and I propose to take no action. I am copying this Minute to the Secretary of State for 
Northern Ireland and to Sir Burke Trend.

GEN 79: Northern Ireland Plebiscite and White Paper 
plebiscite should be held before the White Paper is published. 
In recent discussions Ministers have tended to the view that the I note, 
however, that in your discussion in Belfast with Mr. Faulkner you were careful to leave this issue open when he pressed for the plebiscite to come first. This was also a question to which the Alliance Party devoted a good deal of their attention when they saw you; and their memorandum argued that the White Paper should come first. You may wish to discuss the point further at tomorrow’s GEN 79 meeting. 2. One argument in favour of holding the plebiscite first is that, 
otherwise, the White Paper might be open to the criticism that it was prejudging the results of the plebiscite. On the other hand it can be argued to be unfair to ask people to choose when they do not know what their choice entails - i. e. to ask them to decide whether they prefer to "belong" to the United Kingdom or to Eire without first telling them what sort of constitution they can expect to enjoy if they opt for the former. Moreover, the moderates can reasonably claim that to hold the plebiscite first may create a situation in which the authority of the White Paper may subsequently be challenged by those Protestants who are determined that the North should stay within the United Kingdom, but on their terms. There would, of course, be objection from the Unionists if the White Paper came first; but they could not accuse the Government of having gone back on an undertaking (as they did over the order in which the plebiscite and the local government elections would be taken) since no undertaking has been given. The arguments put forward by the Alliance Party seem to have considerable force.

Northern Ireland: Amendment of Regulation 24A The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has suggested to you 
in his minute of 17th November that we should wait for the report of the Diplock Commission before amending Regulation 24A of the Special Powers Act in order to facilitate the prosecution of members and associates of unlawful associations. 
This would mean reversing the decision reached 
at the meeting of GEN 79 on 6th October, when the balance of opinion was in favour of getting this done quickly. 2. 
The Secretary of State argues that, even by using the urgency 
procedure, we should now not be able to bring the amendment into practical effect until 11th December, which is just about the time when the Diplock report should be ready. I think that there is force in this contention. The proposal to amend Regulation 24A aroused a good deal of political feeling; and, with the Diplock Report now not so very far away, there could be accusations of jumping the gun. Mr. Whitelaw also doubts whether, in present circumstances, the amendment would lead to many more terrorists being put away by the courts. Moreover, if we brought Protestant extremists before the courts, juries might well be less ready to find them guilty than they have been to condemn Roman Catholic extremists. There would be political danger in using the amendment only against Roman Catholics; but equal danger if we brought extremists from both sides before the courts, only to find that the charges against the Protestants were being dismissed. Perhaps, therefore, the first step is for Ministers to decide whether a system of judges sitting without juries is the only way of getting cases of this kind treated impartially. As you know, the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland is said to be sympathetic to the idea of such a change.

NORTHERN 
GENERAL 1. 
IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 170700 TO 200700 HRS NOVEMBER 1972 The level of violence remained low. On Fri/Set there were 17 shooting 
incidents (15 of them involving SF) and 4 explosions; on Sat/Sun 12 (7) and 2; and on Sun/on 30 (22) and 2, making a total for the three days of 59 shooting incidents (44 of them involving SF) and 8 explosions. 
The comparable 
figures for the previous weekend were 37 (27) and 3. The increase in incidents of Sunday mostly occurred in Andersonstown and the Ardoyne, possibly as a result of more Provisional IRA arrests by SF on the previous two days. Casualties totalled one TA soldier wounded (in an accidental discharge); one RUC and two civilians wounded. Four hits were claimed against terrorists. The main event occurred in the Republic, when John Stephenson was arrested in Dublin early on Sunday morning by the Gardai. There was some sympathetic hooli-anism in the Creggan as a result. It reMains to be seen how the authorities in Dublin will deal with Stephonson. Also in the Republic, a bomb exploded on Sunday in Bridge End, Donegal, just outside the Derry enclave. Responsibility was claimed by a UDA commando. In the Province, bombers successfully penetrated the Belfast city centre twice on Fri. The PD march on Sunday in Belfast was small beer, only attended by 400, and an obvious publicity stunt. GB Sunday prose comment was politically orientated and speculative. Late news: Capt WATSON and C Sgt STRUTHERS, 1 A & SH, were killed at 0830 hrs on Mon morning near Crossmaglen when a booby trap bomb went off while they were awaiting the arrival of ATO.

EXPLOSIONS INSIDE CITY CENTRE- 17 NOV 72 1. 
2. 0700 hrs 18 Nov 72 Shortly after 1400 hrs some 6 anonymous warnings were received of bombs 
having been planted in Belfast City Ccntre. The area was cleared although difficulty was experienced in opening some of the control gates. 
At 1425 hrs a 20 lb bomb in a plastic shopping bag exploded on the stairs 
of the CAPSTAN Bar, 10 Anne St causing severe damage and setting the building on fire. At 1428 hrs a similar bomb exploded in an inner room at the CASTLE Inn, Castle Arcade, causing minor damage and again starting a blaze. There were no casualties in either incident. 
3. 4. The bombs are believed to have been planted by 3 youths who were seen 
by SF to have been carrying bags answering this description. They were followed by SF but vanished in the crowd. 
Both premises are near to stores through which one can enter the city centre 
avoiding SF barriers. It is believed that the bombers entered through Woolworths and exited through British Home Stores. In neither case would they have been challenged. 
5. No specific warning of these two bombs was given.

At the meeting of GEN 79 on 6 October we agreed that R ation 24A 
of the Special Powers Act should be amended so as to facilitate the prosecution of members and associates of unlawful associations in Northern Ireland. My Office has accordingly consulted other Departments and prepared a draft Order to give effect to this. 
I am, however, having second thoughts about going ahead with this Order at this stage. The Order is bound to be controversial involving as it does the reversal of the burden of proof and the creation of new offences, and it deals with matters which are clearly within the remit of the Diplock Commission and which we know are being considered by them. If I were convinced that these powers were urgently required, this would not matter. But I have some doubts whether in the event many more terrorists would be put away if we were to amend Regulation 24A. We might bring a few more before the courts - charged with "membership" rather than with other offences 
- but not many. 
I still wish to go ahead with this measure in due course but its passage through the House would undoubtedly be easier if the Diplock Commission commended it to us. There is a timing difficulty too. If the Order were taken by the urgency procedure as logically it should if we cannot wait for the Diplock Report it could be made at the next meeting of the Privy Council on 28 November; we could not then reasonably have a commencement date much before 11 December, about the time that the Diplock Report is likely to be received. This looks rather odd. If we were not to employ the urgency procedure, the position would be worse. 
I do not think too that we can ignore the volume of Northern Ireland legislation coming before Parliament. Unless it is absolutely necessary, I am most reluctant to add to this an 
Order, 
which may have to be changed once we know the views of the Diplock Commission. 
On balance, therefore, I am inclined to wait for the Diplock Report before going ahead with legislation. If necessary, we can then

17th November, 1972 The Alliance Party has suggested that two changes should be made 
in the form of the plebiscite on the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. While we have always been in favour of the plebiscite and have felt that it should be held before any elections are held we do recognise the very grave dangers of holding such a plebiscite at any time. These are that the campaigning will be such that it will lead to mounting tension,greatly exacerbate the already tense situation in the community and consequently lead to increased violence. 
We believe, however, that there is much less chance of this 
happening if the division on the two questions is not on all fours with the division which has caused so much difficulty in Ireland for 350 years. The present questions, however, are such that people will divide along purely sectarian lines. Most of those Catholics who support the constitutional relationship with Britain will either vote against or refrain from voting. 
We believe this sectarian division leading to subsequent increase 
in tension, can be avoided by two changes, one minor and one major. Minor Change: A preamble to the questions of the type suggested making it clear that people are not being asked to make a once and for all decision. This would make it very much easier for Catholics to vote for the first question. 
There is in some quarters a tendency to think that the Plebiscite 
is a "Protestant thing" and that what the Catholics do is irrelevant. This, we believe to be misconceived. A referendum campaign of boycott by the Catholics would be spearheaded by the Republicans and if successful as we believe the present questions would make inevitable, it would lead to greatly increases status for the Republicans who would grab the kudos. Furthermore the effect on Protestant fears of seeing virtually 100% of the Catholic population either boycotting or voting "no" would be disastrous. 
Major Change: Issue of the White Paper before the referendum and phrase the first question in the context of the White Paper. 
Sooner or later the Protestant population are going to have to 
face up to the real alternatives open to them. These we believe to be: (1) Link with Britain on terms acceptable to Britain 
or 
(2) United Ireland. The question is are they more likely to face up to the realities 
of the situation if the White Paper precedes the referendum or follows it. It may be argued that once they have had their referendum they will be more likely to adopt a reasonable attitude towards the White Paper. We believe, however, that if the referendum precedes the White Paper: 
(1) the spearhead of the campaign to say yes to the first question will be Vanguard/U.D.A./L.A.W. with the official Unionist Party trailing behind. 
(2) When there is a massive majority for the link as there will be because of the massive Catholic boycott, this faction will claim credit. 
(3) Having scored such a massive victory they will be drunk with their success and in the arrogance of victory much less amenable to reason on the White Paper than before. We have already seen a foretaste of this attitude in a recent speech of a right-wing Unionist M.P. 
(4) They will claim the authority of well over half a million voters behind their rejection Of the White Paper. If, however, the White Paper is issued first:

However local pcople saw the way in which

There was widespread suspicion that the 
U.D.A. and the Army were working hand-in-hand, and it was therefore important that the Army should take a firm line in suppressing the U.D.A. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland agreed that Derry was now quieter than it had been.

Mr. B. Morton (Chairman) 
Mr. J.S. Agate r. J.T. Eaton 
Dr. R.T. Keys Colonel E.D.R. Shearer 
Mr. G. Bryans (General Manager) 
Mr. Morton said that the centre of Londonderry had 
been damaged more seriously than the centre of Belfast. While the work of reconstruction was going ahead as fast as possible substantial investment was needed quickly. The cost of such investment would be around £1 million, which would have to come from Government sources. 
If 
peaceful conditions were restored, there was the prospect of greater prosperity for Londonderry. By 1975, when the Anglo/Irish Trade Agreement had run its full term and the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland would both be members of the European Community, it could be the trading aid shopping centre for the hinterland of Donegal. Londonderry Protestants were however concerned at 
the prospect of changes in the City’s traditions. Londonderry with its historic walls was as symbolic for Protestants as the Vatican was for Catholics.

Parliament by Lord Carrington would have to be reviewed. ii. 
been given to the Nepalese Government at that time. iii. 
Authorities. iv. 
Great Britain. v. 
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office would establish what undertakings had It seemed unlikely that there would be any major outcry from the Irish There might be considerable adverse reaction from various groups in If posted to Northern Ireland, Ghurkas would not be used for riot control, 
and possibly not on the border either. vi. 
share of duty in Northern Ireland. 
It was noted that the Ministry of Defence were still themselves considering the merits of the proposal. 
As part of the British Army, the Ghurkas should be expected to do their 2nd Reading of Financial Provisions Bill.

17 November, 1972 Thank you for your letter of 13 November about 
Mr. Lynch’s speech at Cork on 3 November and the recommendation which our Ambassador in Dublin made in his telegram no. 678 that some acknowledgement of this speech be made. 
As you know, the Secretary of State for Northern 
Ireland expressed a welcome for Mr. Lynch’s comments on the Paper for Discussion in the course of his speech in the Commons debate on 13 November. Referring to the passage in the Paper for Discussion which states the desirability of any new arrangements for Northern Ireland being acceptable to the Republic, he said: "It is with these thoughts in mind that I welcome very much Mr. Lynch’s helpful approach to this paper as outlined in his recent speech". 
This wording was drafted in consultation with us and we have considered with the Northern Ireland Office whether 
any further action should be taken. We have jointly concluded that it should not. Mr. Lynch’s speech on the whole seems sensible and 
helpful but it was, no doubt deliberately, blurred in its wording and did not make any fresh proposals. While it was clearly right that his co-operative attitude should be acknowledged, to do more than the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has already done seemed to run the risk of encouraging Mr. Lynch to believe that we are quickening our pace still further on the "Irish Dimension", with the result that he might be led to expect concrete results before we are ready for them ourselves. We also bore in mind the fact that his welcome of the Paper for Discussion has gone no further than the general reaction of moderate opinion in the Republic. 
This letter has been agreed with the Northern Ireland Office. 
C. W. Roberts, Esq., 10 Downing Street

Northern Ireland: GEN 79 Sir Burke Trend thought that the Prime Minister would wish next 
week to hold an early meeting of GEN 79 to report to his colleagues on his visit to the Province. He has asked me to report to you the difficulties I have experienced in trying to arrange a meeting for either Monday, 20th November, or Tuesday, 21st November: (a) On Monday morning the Prime Minister attends The Queen’s Silver Wedding Service at the Abbey. 
(b) Monday afternoon, early, the Prime Minister is speaking in the House, and late afternoon the Secretary of State for Defence is talking to M. Debre. 
(c) 
Tuesday morning the Secretary of State for Defence is meeting M. Debre (Guard of Honour, etc.) and then holding meetings the whole morning. 
(d) Tuesday afternoon, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland needs to be in the House for the Plebiscite Bill. 
Sir Burke Trend has had a word with the Secretary of State for 
Defence who is adamant that he should attend any meeting of GEN 79. Sir Burke Trend considers that this means that if a meeting is to be held on the first two days of next week (and the latter three days are, of course, very busy in any case) the best time to do it, if it could be fitted into the Prime Minister’s diary, would be some time on Tuesday afternoon. Such a time would not be welcome to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, but it should not be necessary for him to be on the bench during the whole afternoon. There will be other difficulties, but if a meeting is to be held, they will need to be overcome.

15th November, 1972 Re: NORTHERN IRELAND PLEBISCITE I have been asked by the Executive of the Alliance Party to 
let you know our attitude to the suggested plebiscite. We are absolutely committed to the principle that there can 
be no change in the status of Northern Ireland as part of the United 
Kingdom against the wishes of the majority of people in Northern Ireland, and we think that the best way of ascertaining the views of the people of Northern Ireland is by a plebiscite. We also remember that the holding of an early plebiscite was a firm commitment given by Westminster at the time of the introduction of Direct Rule. 
We are, however, worried about two features of the suggested questions. Firstly, we believe it is important that long-term aspirations 
should not be mixed up or confused with the situation as it is today, and that there should therefore be a preamble on the ballot paper 
making it clear that people are not being asked now to express an opinion which will be a once and for all commitment. 
Secondly, we believe that the first question is at present framed 
in terms which can give rise to widespread confusion. It is meaningless to ask people to vote for the link with Britain without making it clear the terms under which the link is acceptable to Britain. We have already seen the widely differing interpretations which have been placed on the Green Paper. We believe it is essential that the White Paper spelling out very clearly the terms of the link with the rest of the United Kingdom should be published before the plebiscite takes place. 
I append the suggested preamble and questions. We believe that 
if the plebiscite, which we do not want to see postponed unduly, is held under these terms it will be prevented from turning into a sectarian head-count, and will offer the people of Northern Ireland a valuable opportunity to express their true feelings on the real options open to us.

NORTHERN IRELAND PLEBISCITE 
PREAMBLE AND AMENDED QUESTIONS FROM THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE OF THE ALLIANCE PARTY OF NORTHERN IRELAND. 
It is the intention of the United Kingdom Government to hold 
plebiscites on the constitutional position of Northern Ireland from time to time: 
These are the choices now open:- 
Do you wish Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom under the terms outlined in the White Paper? OR 
Do you wish Northern Ireland to be joined with the Republic of Ireland?

Dear Prime Minister: I write to express to you the great concern 
we feel at the proposal to hold a Plebiscite in the North of Ireland, and especially at the suggested form of words to be used in the Questions on the Ballot Paper. 
The Green Paper on "The Future Of Northern 
Ireland" was, I believe, generally regarded as providing a basis for useful discussions. The proposed plebiscite must be considered as unhelpful to these discussions.

TO IMMEDIATE N I 0 LONDON TELNO 39 OF 10 NOVEMBER 1972 INFO PRIORITY F C 0 AND DUBLIN. FOR WOODIFIELD , 
TREVELYAN AND PRIVATE OFFICE. 
REFERENDUM ON THE BORDER. 1. MR ROY BRADFORD ASKED IF I COULD ARRANGE FOR HIM TO MEET HMA DUBLIN DURING HIS NOVEMBER 8TH VISIT TO DUBLIN. THE AMBASSADOR KINDLY SAW MR BRADFORD AND THE LATTER THEN SAW MR LYNCH. 
I SAW 
MR BRADFORD HERE ON THE 9 NOVEMBER AND HE TOLD ME OF HIS MEETING WITH MR LYNCH. 
2. THE MAIN SUBJECT DISCUSSED WAS APPARENTLY THE PLEBISCITE ON THE BORDER. MR LYNCH SAID HE UNDERSTOOD HMG’S REASONS FOR HOLDING THE PLEBISCITE, BUT HE DID NOT LIKE IT. HE AND MR BRADFORD AGREED THAT IF THE ACTUAL QUESTIONS IN THE PLEBISCITE WERE THOSE PROPOSED IN THE BILL THERE WAS A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT MANY CATHOLICS WOULD BOYCOTT THE PLEBISCITE, AND THE RESULT WOULD THEREFORE BE A DISTORTED AND MISLEADING ONE. WITH THE OBJECT OF AVOIDING THIS, MR BRADFORD SUGGESTED THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF THERE WERE A THIRD QUESTION ASKING SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF ’DO YOU FAVOUR COOPERATION WITH SOUTHERN IRELAND ON ECONOMIC AND SIMILAR MATTERS?’. THIS THIRD QUESTION WOULD GO WELL WITH 
AND NOT CONFLICT WITH THE FIRST QUESTION (DO YOU WANT TO STAY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM). ACCORDING TO MR BRADFORD, MR LYNCH WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THIS SUGGESTION. THEY APPRECIATED THAT HMG COULD NOT, EVEN IF IT WANTED TO, NOW PUT FORWARD SUCH A THIRD QUESTION, AND THAT IT WOULD THEREFORE HAVE TO BE PUT FORWARD BY THE LABOUR PARTY DURING THE DEBATE ON THE BILL. 
3. I POINTED OUT TO MR BRADFORD THAT ALTHOUGH THE PROPOSAL DID 
HAVE THE ADVANTAGES WHICH HAD LED HIM TO SUGGEST IT AND MR LYNCH TO ACCEPT IT, IT ALSO HAD CONSIDERABLE DISADVANTAGES. A MAIN PURPOSE OF THE PLEBISCITE WAS TO REASSURE THE PROTESTANTS IN THE NORTH, AND HENCE THE QUESTIONS WERE BASICALLY SIMPLE ONES IE ARE YOU FOR OR AGAINST THE BORDER?. TO INTRODUCE A THIRD QUESTION 
OF THE NATURE SUGGESTED BY MR BRADFORD WOULD WATER DOWN THE EFFECT OF THE PRESENT TWO QUESTIONS, WOULD LESSEN THE REASSURANCE WHICH THE PLEBISCITE WOULD GIVE TO THE PROTESTANTS AND MIGHT /EVEN

2. Tribunals 
The Commissioners started their hearings on 10 November. Administrative arrangements at Long Kesh had been completed. 
3. Prime Minister’s Visit 
There was a working party at Stormont Castle under Sir Harold Black, on which the Army were represented. Mr Williams was co-ordinating arrangements at the London end. 
4. Arrest Policy 
MOD stressed their need for a directive on arrest policy for Protestant extremists. It was agreed that any new policy would have to be settled at the highest level. 
5. Army Reinforcements during the Plebiscite 
It was noted that from MOD’s point of view the preferred date for the Plebiscite was in the last fortnight of January. This would be the most convenient time to provide Army reinforcements. 
A further important factor in determining the date of the Plebiscite was its timing in relation to the subsequent publication of the White Paper.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 100700 TO 130700 HRS NOVEMBER 1972 GENERAL 1. 
The level of violence remained low. On Fri/Sat there were 10 shooting 
incidents (9 of them involving SF) and 2 explosions; on Sat/Sun 14 (10) and 1 and on Sun/Mon 13 (8) and nil explosions, making a total for the three days of 37 shooting incidents (27 of them involving SF) and 3 explosions. (The comparable figures for the previous weekend were 45 (37) shooting incidents and 2 explosions). Casualties totalled 2 soldiers killed, the first (RCT att 1 LI) by a sniper at a VCP in Belfast on Fri; and the second (A & SH) hit and accidentally killed by a train near NEWRY on Sun; one civilian was murdered in Belfast on Sat (RC in Prot area - 690 Crumlin Rd) and three civilians were wounded. Four hits were claimed against terrorists. The main events were the start of the Tribunals on Fri 
- they reviewed 8 cases, confirming 6 and 
releasing 2 - and the announcement by CESA leaders that an unarmed but uniformed Catholic home guard (literally) was to start operating on UDA lines. GB Sunday press comment on the Ulster situation was off the headline, although continued arrests of Provisional IRA leaders were reported in minor key on mostfront pages. The Observer carried a piece on UDR/UIDA allegiances the S Times a speculative piece on the possible effects of a proposed new Dublin law, based on the principle that IRA suspects will be guilty until they prove themselves innocent.

10 November, 1972 In May and June of 1971 there was correspondence 
between the Prime Minister and Mr. Lynch concerning a proposal by the Government of the Irish Republic that they should build a television station near Carlingford Lough, just South of the Border, with the object of making it possible for the citizens of Northern Ireland to receive the broadcasts of RTE (the Irish Broadcasting Authority). In a letter dated 10 May the Prime Minister rejected the proposal; Mr. Lynch replied on 31 May and the Prime Minister sent a further letter on 19 June. 
The Irish have now raised the matter again. This 
time they have not approached us on a political level, but have instead sought to register with the International Frequency Registration Board at Geneva the necessary use of frequencies. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications have received official notification of this from the Board and it is open to them to raise an objection to the Irish proposals. 
After discussion between the FCO, the 
Northern Ireland Office and MPT, it has become clear that the objections to the Irish proposal are no less strong now than they were on the previous occasion. Apart from the obvious exacerbation of tension in Northern Ireland which would result from our agreeing to this proposal, what the Irish have in mind, 
- namely, the deliberate 
beaming of domestic broadcasts into another country’s territory is contrary to international agreement. To accept it in this case would seriously compromise our position with regard to other countries who have in the past attempted to do the same thing. Further, RTE broadcasts advertisements. If these were to be widely receivable in Northern Ireland it would put at risk the advertising revenue on which the IBA’s programme contractor in Northern Ireland 
- Ulster Television 
depends for its existence. Ulster TV is not financially strong because the population of Northern Ireland is relatively small and not very rich. 
We propose that MPT should register an objection 
to the Irish proposal. It is possible that that will be the end of the matter. On the other hand, Mr. Lynch could well revert to the matter again at Prime Ministerial level. Before MPT go ahead, therefore, it is desirable to have confirmation that the Prime Minister is still of the same mind as he

Review of the Position in Northern Ireland (GEN 79(72) 26) 
The main purpose of tomorrow’s meeting is to enable Ministers to 
consider their strategy between now and next March, when the first year of direct rule will have come to an end and the Government should therefore have given a clear indication of the "final solution". 2. 
assumptions:(a) That "if we maintain and intensify our political and security pressures on the IRA, the long battle against their terror can be won!’. (Paragraph 3). (b) 
the IRA before Motorman". (Paragraph 4). 3. 
The Secretary of State’s proposals for this purpose are based on two That "the Protestant extremists now present a mirror image of The Secretary of State suggests that, against this background, the 
broad lines of our future strategy, as regards both the majority and the minority, are clear - namely to continue to seek increasingly to isolate the extremists from the moderates; to diminish the capacity of the extremists for violence; and to develop the hope and prospect of a peaceful political settlement. He suggests also that these aims need to be pursued simultaneously on both the security and the political fronts. As regards the former he would prefer to develop his thoughts orally tomorrow. As regards the latter he envisages a phased programme of action, starting with further consultations on the basis of the Green Paper in order to narrow down more precisely the area within which a settlement must be sought; proceeding, at about the turn of the year, to the plebiscite on the Border; and culminating in the publication, in the spring, of a White Paper disclosing the Government’s definitive proposals for a settlement. 4. 
Itis difficult to fault this progression as a programme of action. 
But Ministers will need to consider it from two different pointsof view first, if it succeeds; second, if it fals. 
Its chances of success depend 
partly, as the Secretary of State recognises, on the extent to which the further security measures which he has in mind prove to be sufficient

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 030700 TO 060700 HRS NOVEMBER 1972 GENERAL 1. 
The level of violence was low. On Fri/Sat there were 17 shooting 
incidents (14 of them involving SF) and nil explosions; on Sat/Sun 13 (11) and nil; and on Sun/Mon 15 (12) and 2 explosions, making a total for the three days of 45 shooting incidents (37 of them involving SF) and only 2 explosions, which is well below the recent daily average of 26 (19) and 2.4 respectively. Casualties totalled two soldiers wounded; one civilian attached to the RCT was killed in a road accident; and four other civilians were wounded. Three hits were claimed against terrorists.

Fire was returned. One soldier was wounded, two hits are claimed and in the follow up three more men were arrested. GB Sunday press comment carried plaudits for the Green Paper (which more than sustains the NIO’s reputation for being the most ably staffed in Whitehall - S Times) and included a plea from Conor Cruise O’Brien in the Observer for at least one more question in the border plebiscite of the type ’Do you hope one day to live in a United Ireland’. On other subjects, S Times covered the spate of sectarian murders; the Observer covered the possible development of a rural campaign; and most papers gave varying headline prominence to the recapture of Gusty Spence. In the Republic, a mineral water factory at MUFF, Donegal, immediately north of Derry, was reportedly blown up on Saturday. A UDA ’commando’ claimed credit, and threatened retaliation bomb for bomb’. Elsewhere, Mrs Marie Drumm, vice President of the Provisional Sinn Fein, was arrested by the Gardai.

This week the Government has published a discussion paper called 
’The Future of Northern Ireland’. This sets out the basic points to be taken into account in 
deciding how best to reach a fair and just settlement of Northern Ireland’s problems. 
(Leaflet attached.) Mr. Whitelaw has appealed to everyone in Northern Ireland to 
reed and study the paper carefully before reaching conclusions about its contents. The Government see the paper as providing a comprehensive basis 
for further discussions and it is their intention urgently to set these in hand. The paper does not set out any single cut and dried scheme for 
the future of the Province. conditions - 
But it sets out some fundamental including the clear pledges of successive British Governments - which any settlement must meet. 
As Mr. Whitelaw says in his foreword to the paper "the futu.e of any community depends upon the will of its own people to live, to work and to make progress together; in the last resort, responsibility for bringing about a peaceful future lies with them. ... 
This paper seeks to provide a basis for discussion as to how that may best be achieved." Also this week the Government has presented to Parliament a 
Bill which will enable the people of Northern Ireland to make their wishes known on the question of the Border. The voter is to be aske whether he wants orthern Ireland to 
remain part of the United Kingdom, or whether he wants Northern Ireland to be joined with the Republic of Ireland outside the United Kingdom. Mr. Whitelaw has stressed that just as soon as legislation 
processe and organisation and printing will allow, the poll will take place. As the popular leaflet explaining the discussion paper says, 
"No scheme of government, however carefully drawn, can do more than present an opportunity for progress. It is in the hearts and minds of the people and not just the words of Acts of Parliament that the capacity for working and living together must flourish." 
of the Lord President of the Council 3rd November, 1972

TO IMMEDIATE FCO TELNO 676 OF 4 NOVEMBER, 1972. 
1. THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A SPEECH DELIVERED BY MR LYNCH IN CORK LAST NIGHT. BEGINS. 
"THE GREEN PAPER ON THE FUTURE OF NORTHERN IRELAND REPRESENTS A WELCOME AND CONSTRUCTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF THE PROBLEM. AS THE TOLL OF SENSELESS KILLINGS, SAVAGE BRUTALITY, VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION CONTINUES TO MOUNT, IT BECOMES INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT MAJOR CHANGES IN ATTITUDES, BEHAVIOUR AND INSTITUTIONS ARE NEEDED, BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH, IN ORDER TO BRING STABLE AND LASTING PEACE. 
THE GREEN PAPER OPENS WITH THE WORDS ’’THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAVE A CLEAR OBJECTIVE IN NORTHERN IRELAND. IT IS TO DELIVER ITS PEOPLE FROM THE VIOLENCE AND FEAR IN WHICH THEY LIVE TODAY AND TO SET THEM FREE TO REALISE THEIR GREAT POTENTIAL TO THE FULL’’. WE - GOVERNMENT 
, OPPOSITION AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH - FULLY SHARE THAT OBJECTIVE. WE ALSO 
WANT TO SEE AND END TO DIVISION, HATRED AND BLOODSHED AMONG IRISHMEN. WE WANT TO SEE NOT ONLY THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND REALISING ’’ THEIR GREAT POTENTIAL TO THE FULL’’ BUT ALL THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND WITHIN THE NORTH, AND NORTH AND SOUTH, WORKING TOGETHER AND REALISING AN EVEN GREATER POTENTIAL. 
ONE ESSENTIAL PART OF THE SEARCH FOR PEACE IS THE NEED TO FIND A POLITICAL STRUCTURE WHICH CAN COMMAND THE CONSENT OFTHE SEPARATE COMMUNITIES IN THE NORTH. SINCE THE GREEN PAPER IS INTENDED FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES, IT NATURALLY DOES NOT POINT TO ANY SINGLE OR SPECIFIC SET OF POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS. IT DOES, HOWEVER, SUGGEST THAT SOME COURSES OF ACTION ARE MORE PROBABLE THAN OTHERS. IT WOULD SEEM, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT FAVOUR EITHER THE COMPLETE INTEGRATION OF NORTHERN IRELAND WITH BRITAIN OR ATTEMPTS TO CREATE AN INDEPENDENT STATE IN NORTHERN IRELAND. THESE ARE. AGAIN. VIEWS WHICH WE FULLY SHARE.

NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NOON ON FRIDAY 3 NOVEMBER 1. 
Tribunals 
The Order in Council was made on 1 November, will be laid on Monday 6 Novenber and commence on Thursday 9 Novenber. Particular care will be required in the drafting of the press notice and the way in which the names of the Commissioners are disclosed. The latter must be informed before-hand of the intention to disclose their names. 
2. 
Green Paper The debate on the Green Paper will be on Wednesday 8 November. 
3. Plebiscite 
The Border Poll Bill will have its Second Reading on Monday 13 November. The Secretary of State intended to open to debate. The remaining stages of the Bill will be taken on Wednesday 15 November. 
4. Financial ProvisionsBill 
The Second Reading will be on Monday 13 November, and the remaining stages probably taken on Friday 17 November. 
5. Parliamentary Programme 
The planned programme in Parliament for Northern Ireland business might be disrupted by the introduction of measures on prices and incomes. 
6. The Border 
One of the aims of the IRA is to draw the Army out of the hard areas of Belfast and Londonderry, and into the border areas. The reaction by the IRA and by Protestant extremists in Belfast and Londonderry if we did so is predictable. The need for strengthening security on the border using only the units at present allocated to the border is urgent. A curfew applied to certain Border areas is under consideration. Lt Col Nevill’s study on the Border would be expedited. Lord Windlesham and Mr Howell would be making separate tours of Border areas in the coming week. A further discussion on border security would be held in the Secretary of State’s morning meeting at Stormont Castle on Monday.

MEMORANDUM ON THE GREEN PAPER - "THE FUTURE OF NORTHERN IRELAND" In this memorandum we comment on some of those passages in the 
Green Paper where alternative courses of action are set out for discussion, We follow the same order of topics as in tho Green Paper itself. In places we have modified our previous views, in the light of the paper or of the submssions from political parties. At the outset we should like to express our gratitude to the 
author of the Green Paper. He has provided a lucid and unsentimental disussion of the issues, and his work deserves to be a milestone on the way to a sane political settlement in Northern Ireland. 
PLEBISCITES (para 41) When in announcing Direct Rule the Prime Minister committed 
himself to the idea of periodic plebiscites, he was adopting a proposal which had been widely canvassed on all sides. In 1970, John Hume had included it among his submissions to the Crowther Commission. More recently, the Unionist government had included it among proposals put to the Westminster government. We form the impression, however, that after the extreme difficulties 
encountered over the last few weeks in finding a form of words acceptable to all, many people are now disenchanted with the idea of a plebiscite. Certainly our own doubts about its value have increased. We agree that the poll arranged for early in the New Year must be hold 
the wording be altered along the lines that we have argued in a separate memorandum. (Copy attached) . 
- though we urge that We said there that a plebiscite on the Border 
is meaningless unless it follows the White Paper spelling out the terms and conditions of the British link. We also think there is a case for announcing that a further plebiscite will be held in ten years’ time. This will have the merit of helping many whose long-term aspiration is for a united Ireland to vote "Yes" to remaining in the United Kingdom on the government’s terms at the present time. They will know that if they vote "Yes" now, they will have a further opportunity to state their views in ten years’ time. But we think it unwise to make any commitment now to holding an 
indefinite series of referenda at intervals through the future. No one can tell how circumstances will evolve, and decisions for the longer term should be taken nearer the time. Moreover, we know of no precedent for aM indefinite eries of referenda. There are several instances of the fate of territory being decided by the vote of the people concerned e.g.,Saar, tipper Silesia - but in each case just one vote was taken and it was considered 
final. To maintain the political momentum the White Paper should be 
followed quickly by the Plebiscite, and both local and Regional Assembly elections be held as soon as possible thereafter.

MEMORANDUM BY THE NEW ULSTER MOVEMENT TO ALL WESTMINSTER M.P.s NORTHERN IRELAND REFERENDUM A referendum was promised by H.M. Government on the. 
7TH NOVEMBER 1972 
prorogation of Stormont, to allow the people of Northern Ireland to show if they wished to maintain their link with the rest of the U.K. 
This was, we believe, a sincere effort to reassure the "majority" : it 
was also possibly thought of as a means to allow those in favour 
of Irish unity, both North and South, to work to persuade the Unionist of the wisdom of their case. 
Northern Ireland the referendum as currently proposed is likely, at to be divisive and, at worst, a catalyst for severe communal violence in many areas. It is, therefore, of immense importance 
Under the present highly charged circumstances in 
that the referendum be conducted in such a way as to produce a constructive result. 
NEGATIVE POSSIBLE RESULTS OF THE CURRENT PROPOSALS 2. Violence and impersonation in so called normal times 
were never absent from Northern Ireland elections. Electioneering on this single, highly emotive issue of "the Border" is nearly certain to produce communal violence and accusations of various malpractices. 
2. Abstention by a large part of the "minority" is a real 
probability giving therefore a result that solves nothing. The Protestant extremists will be reinforced in their view that all Catholics are "enemies of the state". Mass abstention opens the way to mass personation 
3. An overwhelming majority, unless the referendum is 
clearly based upon the White Paper, will strengthen the hand of the Protestant extremist in his demands for a return of a strong Stormont or indeed U.D.I. 
4. The Dublin Government may be provoked into the folly 
of holding a referendum on the same date, so widening even further the gulf between the two Irelands. 
ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS 1. 
We are strongly of the opinion that the rferendum should be held after the publication of the White Paper setting out 
Her Majesty’s Government’s proposals on the future of Northern Ireland. e hope that the White Paper will be ready no later than early January 1973. 
The referendum should be based on the new electoral register 
operational on the 15th February 1973. With this timetable a member of the minority will know an active, permanent role and a share in the running 
that if he votes "Yes" to a continuation of a U.K. link, that he will be guaranteed 
of the new administration of Northern Ireland. The Vanguard/UDA faction will -be faced with the choice of binding themselves to being British, on British terms, with British responsibilities, or, settling for a bankrupt independnt Northern Ireland. The thinking Unionist will be able to vote "Yes" without any fear of supporting any form of UDI. 
2. That a definite statement be made that the result of 
the referendum will be bnding for a period of 10 years when a repeat will be held.

29th November 1972 At the GEN 79(72)33rd meeting on 11th September the Prime 
Minister said that "the question of members of the UDR who were also associated with the UDA required further consideration. The Secretary of State (for Northern Ireland) should circulate a note indicating what he proposed". 
The policy in force at that time was established in July 
1972 in the light of three major factors. First, the UDA is not an illegal organisation and membership of it is not an offence under military law. Secondly, an important function of the UDA is to channel into a constructive and disciplined direction Protestant energies which might otherwise become disruptive. Thirdly, although an application to join the UDR would not be automatically rejected because of UDA membership, due weight would be given in the vetting process to extreme Protestant sympathies and a person known to be a member of the UDA would be most unlikely to be admitted. 
Against this background, the policy established in July 
was that an officer should be asked to resign if he took an active part in UDA activities. A soldier would be warned if suspected of sufficient sympathy for UDA aims to affect his military duties or call in question his loyalty; if his conduct arising from UDA membership constituted a military offence or unsatisfactory conduct, he would be dismissed. 
This policy was kept under review, but only recently has 
it been considered necessary to make changes. Following discussions with the GOC, and consultation with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Defence Secretary has decided to apply this policy more strictly. He has therefore approved a new Regimental Routine Order which was issued on 27th November. I attach the text of this at Annex. It was

Timing of the Border Poll in Northern Ireland (GEN 79(72) 27) 
In this memorandum the Secretary of State examines the practical 
considerations influencing a decision on the date of the poll and the date for publication of the White Paper. He takes, as necessary assumptions, the hypotheses that the Bill will complete its passage through Parliament by 7th December and that thereafter the Affirmative Order fixing the date for the poll and prescribing the Regulations which are to govern its conduct must be passed before the House adjourns on 21st December if we are to have any chance of holding the poll by the earliest date which is administratively practicable, i. e. the end of January. The Committee might start by asking the Leader of the House whether these Parliamentary hypotheses are realistic. 2. 
If they are, the Committee should turn to the logistics of the project. 
The Under Sheriffs who are responsible for conducting the poll say that they will need 12 weeks, starting from the time when they know the date of the poll and the regulations for its conduct. A slightly more optimistic estimate (by Northern Ireland officials) is that the poll could take place in nine weeks from now, if work were started at once on those things which do not depend on the Affirmative Order fixing the date of the poll. At the best, therefore, it seems that the poll cannot take place before the end of January; and, on the Under Sheriffs’ estimate, it could not take place until the end of February or early in March. 3. 
The Secretary of State considers, however, that a poll in February 
is out of the question in any case, since the new Electoral Register (replacing the 1971 Register) is published in the middle of that month. Objection could reasonably be expected if the poll took place very closely before its publication; and it would take a few weeks after publication before a poll on the new basis could be organised. 4. 
The White Paper could hardly be ready for publication until February, 
given the need for a round of discussion with interested groups and the complex task of drafting this controversial and sensitive document. 
the Secretary of State would not wish to delay the White Paper beyond February. 
But

29 November 1972 
Mark Forrester Esq 10 Downing Street SW1 
You asked earlier this week what points the Secretary of State would like raised at the meeting with Harold Wilson this afternoon. He thinks the following would be a useful agenda: 
1. 2. The timing of the White Paper and the plebiscite. 
A general discussion on the security situation, with particular reference to militant Protestant action and possible Protestant refusal to work any White Paper constitution (the Secretary of State feels very strongly that Mr Wilson should be made aware of this last point). 
3. 
Any points Mr Wilson may have about the proposed White Paper (although the Secretary of State feels that sensitive issues such as representation at Westminster would probably be best avoided until the Government have considered them themselves).

Northern Ireland The Rt. Hon. Harold Wilson, M.P., accompanied by 
Mr. Merlyn Rees, M.P., came to see the Prime Minister, who was accompanied by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Mr. R.T. Armstrong, in his room in the House of Commons on Wednesday 29 November 1972 at 5.00 p.m. The Prime Minister said that he had visited Belfast, 
Londonderry and the border during his two-day visit to Northern Ireland recently.

He had found the atmosphere markedly different He had talked to patrols coming out of the His impression was that the relations 
between the security forces and the people of the Bogside and Creggan had improved. 
The main problem was now the young people of nine to eleven. He had talked to Brian Morton of the Londonderry Commission. 
The Commission was effectively in action, since, although only the Protestant members attended the formal meetings, they had formed the habit of meeting the Catholic members for lunch after the formal meetings and going over the business then. 
The Commission had done 
a very good job of work in Londonderry but were concerned about their future: the Commission would not fit into the new pattern of local government and Londonderry was expected to go republican in the local goverment elections. The Prime Minister said that he had visited the border.

NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NOON ON TUESDAY 28 NOVEMBER 1. The CGS’ Draft Directive to GOC 
The CGS’ draft directive to the GOC on post Motorman policy was discussed. It was noted that action on this rested with Custis’ letter to Platt of 3 November, and that a reply had been delayed while Ministers considered the merits of subsuming in some publishable document the proposed directive to the GOC. It was agreed that the Northern Ireland Office would inform Ministry of Defence as soon as a decision had been given about the issue of the directive. 
2. Vehicle Documentation Scheme 
The draft paper for GEN 79 on Border control and vehicle documentation was circulated and discussed. It was agreed that Ministry of Defence would aim to clear the draft with HQNI that afternoon, so that the paper could be circulated for the GEN 79 meeting on Thursday. 
3. Reaction to a new Provisional Ceasefire 
It was agreed that the Ministry of Defence paper on this subject should be discussed at the NIOM meeting on Friday, with particular reference to the need for changes in operational orders to the Army in the event of a ceasefire having occurred. 
4. Troops reinforcements for the Plebiscite and White Paper Publication 
There were a number of factors affecting the date when the plebiscite could be held. The Under Sheriffs had said that they needed 12 weeks to prepare for the poll, after the legislation had been approved, though this figure might be cut to 9. The period from 16 February - 28 February could not be used, following the introduction of the new electoral register. If the poll was to be held before the White Paper the most likely period seemed to be early in February. It was noted that for logistic reasons, Ministry of Defence would prefer a date in the latter part of January or early February, but that there would be no overriding problem for them if either of the 2 events were to fall outside that period. 
5. 
Next Meeting The next NIOM will be at Noon on Friday 1 December in Conference Room "B".

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 240700 TO 270700 HRS NOVEMBER 1972 GENERAL 1. 
In spite of the meeting in LONDON between the PM and Mr Lynch on Friday, 
the weekend was dominated by events in DUBLIN, where John STEPHENSON (who is on a hunger strike) was jailed for six months (the minimum sentence) by a Special Ccurt, for being a member of the TRA, an illegal organisation. Earlier the same Court jailed an Irish radio journalist for three months for refusing to identify Stephenson’s voice on tape recording of a radio interview, which itself had led earlier on Saturday to the sacking by the Dublin Government of the entire governing body of RTE, the state TV and radio authority, for breaching an Oct 71 order "to refrain from broadcasting any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means." On Saturday evening 100 Irish radio and TV journalists went on a 48 hour strike in protest over their colleague’s sentence, effectively blacking out RTE programmes. On Sunday, Provisional Sinn Fein anger at Stephenson’s sentence led to peaceful demonstrations in Dublin (outside the Mater Hospital) and in LONDON (at the Aer Lirgus offices). An attempt to release Stephenson by force was foiled by the Gardai. A bomb (no warning) in a late night cinema in DUBLIN en Sat/Sun injured 25 people. 
2. The situation in the Province remained relatively unchanged, except in the 
Ardone area of BELFAST on Sunday evening, when an intersectarion gun battle developed, and soon involved SF (3LI), against whose OPs Republican gunmen concentrated their fire in between sporadic Unionist shooting. 10 hits were claimed by SF against Republican gunmen in this lengthy encounter. There were no SF casualties. Unionist casualties 
- if any - are not known. Apart from this incident (which accounted for 60 shootings), the level of violence was low. On 
Fri/Sat there were 19 shooting incidents (12 of them involving SF) and 4 explosions; on Sat/Sun 26(16) and 2 and on Sun/Mon 73(68) and 1, making a total for the three days (less the 60 shooting incidents in the Ardoyne gun battle) of 58 shooting incidents (36 of them involving SF) and 7 explosions. The comparable figures for the previous weekend were 59 (44) and 8. Casualties totalled 4 soldiers wounded and 6 civilians injured. One hit was claimed against terrorists, in addition to the 10 in the Ardone battle. 
3. GB Sunday press comment headlined the Stephenson affair. There was little 
speculation about the outcome of the Prime Minister’s meeting with Mr Lynch on Friday.

0700 HRS SUNDAY 26 NOVEMBER - 0700 HRS MONDAY 27 NOVEMBER 1972 BELFAST 1. 
A major gun battle in the Ardoyne which followed a Sinn Fein demonstration 
and intersectarion disturbances, led to a sharp increase in the number of shooting incidents. 72 were reported, 60 of which occurred in the Ardoyne. SF were involved in all but 5 of these incidents, opening fire 15 times and returning fire 7 times. A number of gunmen were seen to stagger or be dragged away and 10 hits 
- possibly more (All RC) - were claimed. Although the 
shooting lasted most of the evening there were no SF casualties. The shooting had started after disturbances had escalated into a high intensity shooting match between Catholic and Protestant gunmen firing over the peaceline. Fire was soon concentrated on SF OPs by the Catholic gunmen and in all 300 rounds were fired at SF and 51 rounds were returned. The Bde Reserve, 1 PWO, was deployed and intensive patrolling of the area began. Over 40 baton rounds were fired when SF patrols were stoned and bottled, but the area was generally quiet by midnight. Elsewhere in Belfast 4 civilians were wounded, 2 of them seriously, in incidents not involving SF. 4 men (all RC) were arrested at a dance in the Clonard Hall.
