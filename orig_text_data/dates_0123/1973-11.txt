SITUATION a. 
General. Although the prospects for political progress 
are set fair by the recent agreement to establish a designate Executive, composed of members of the Alliance, SDLP and Unionist Parties, both the IRA and extreme Loyalists have declared their opposition to it and their intention to wreck it. If the recent agreement holds, it is to be hoped that progress will continue through the following developments: 
(1) (2) Talks between HMG, the Eire Government and the 
Executive (designate) towards the establishment of a Council of Ireland. 
Final agreement on the Executive, possibly before 
Christmas. (3) 
Devolution of powers to the Assembly and Executive 
by Westminster, possibly early in Jan 74. (4) 
early 1974. b. The Threat. The threat is described in Annex A and can 
be summarised as follows: (1) 
Although the UVF are considered most likely to 
maintain their ceasefire, there are 4 flashpoints in the short term when they, possibly assisted by other less extreme Protestant organisations, might resume their campaign of violence: 
(a) The announcement of the date for tripartite 
talks on a Council of Ireland, (b)

MINISTER OF STATE US OF S(ARMY) PSO/CDS PS/PUS MA/CGS DMO DASD 
AUS(GS) BGS(INT) DPR(ARMY)) 
30th November 1973 The GOC Northern Ireland, with the agreement of the Director 
and Co-ordinator of Intelligence, has recommended that, in view of the possibility of a major outbreak of violence by Protestant Extremists connected with the preliminary talks on the formation of a Council of Ireland during the coming weeks, the Spearhead battalion should be placed at a reduced notice of 24 hours as from midday next Monday, 3rd December, and that a further unit Should be brought to 72 hours notice from the same date. 
The Defence Secretary, on CGS’s advice, believes that this 
recommendation should be accepted. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has also been consulted and agrees. Lord Carrington has accordingly approved that the necessary instructions be issued. You may feel that the Prime Minister should be informed of this. 
We have always recognised that once instructions for notice 
to be reduced in this way have been issued,it is fairly likely that the fact will become public knowledge. Lord Carrington considers, however, that it should not be unduly difficult to explain this action as a sensible precautionary measure similar to those taken at the time of the Elections earlier this year.

Chief of Staff Headquarters Northern Ireland 
28 November 1973 CONTINGENCY PLANNING - CODEWORD 
To assist you in your contingency planning the codeword CHANTRY is to be taken into use forthwith. Its meaning is: 
1. 
"The reinforcement of Northern Ireland [by up to six battalions] in the event of a serious outbreak of Protestant extremist violence in reaction to the formation of a power sharing Executive and/or progress on the Council of Ireland". 
2. The codeword may be used at your discretion within Northern Ireland, 
but is at this stage only known in the MOD to copy addressees of this letter. The planning will be handled in the MOD on a strictly need to know basis. 
The adoption of the codeword does not, of course, indicate agreement or disagreement to the plans which you have currently under consideration.

A/20/Misc/5737 (ASD 2a) November 1873 
SPEARHEAD ROSTER - NOVEMEBER 1973 to JANUARY 1975 Reference: A. 1. 
A/20/Misc/5737 (ASD 2a) dated 1 September 1972. General. The Spearhead roster for the period 7 November 1973 
to 8 January 1975 is at Annex A. Duties are to change at 0900 hours on the dates shown. In addition, HQ BAOR is at all times to be prepared to nominate a Northern Ireland Reserve Unit. This instruction does not take account of the group elements, which are to be nominated by HQ United Kingdom Land Forces and which are to be at notice for destinations other than Northern Ireland; orders for these have been issued separately. 
2. Command. For the purpose of Spearhead duty, a unit stationed 
in Great Britain but, not normally under command of C-in-C United Kingdom Land Forces will be under his operational command from the day on which it is briefed for the duty by HQ United Kingdom Land Forces until the day on which it completes the duty. Briefing will normally take place at HQ United Kingdom Land Forces 6 weeks before the unit assumes the duty. HQ United Kingdom Land Forces is 
authorized to deal direct with such units. However, whenever time permits, communication should be through the normal chain of command. 
3. Emplaning Strengths. HQ United Kingdom Land Forces is to draw 
the attention of the units on the Spearhead roster to the fact that it is the units’ responsibility to notify HQ United Kingdom Land Forces through the normal channels, with a copy to the Ministry of Defence (ASD 2a), of their forecast emplaning strength and of any serious deficiencies in key ranks and trades at least 2 weeks before they assume the duty. Minimum requirements are: 
a. For Destinations other than Northern Ireland. The emplaning 
strength is not to fall below 450 all ranks (except for non infantry units who may reduce to 420 if essential). HQ United 
Kingdom Land Forces is to keep the Ministry of Defence (ASD 2a) informed of any units likely to require reinforcement to meet the minimum strength; arrangements will then be made to meet the balance required.
