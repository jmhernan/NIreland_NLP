NORTHERN IRELAND REINFORCEMENTS 1. 
You will recall that at your meeting on 5 October, CGS 
reported (1) that proposals to send further reinforcements to Northern Ireland were being studied and that 3 more major units would probably be needed. 
2. I am informed that Ministers have now decided to increase the 
force level of major units in the infantry role from 13 to 16 from 18 October until at least the end of the year. An increase in the number of Royal Engineer squadrons deployed in the Province will also be needed but the size and duration of this redeployment depends on a number of decisions yet to be made. It is likely to be an additional two squadrons for a period of not less than three months. 
3. After consideration of the many factors involved, it has been 
agreed by the Navy and Army Departments that the following major units, all of which are stationed in the United Kingdom, should be selected for the reinforcement: 
1 COLDSTREAM GUARDS 
45 COMMANDO RM 1 ROYAL SCOTS. 
Their addition to the order of battle will enable the GOC to 
intensify operations in Belfast against gunmen and bombers and, in conjunction with the humping or cratering of selected roads, to introduce a measure of control along the border with Eire. Depending on future circumstances it may also be possible to mount 
an operation in Londonderry. CCS 32nd Meeting/71 Item 2.

BORDER INCURSIONS. 
1. THE CRATERING OPERATION WHICH BEGAN ON 13 OCTOBER WAS AVOWEDLY DESIGNED TO HINDER THE PASSAGE OF MEN AND MATERIALS BY THE IRA INTO NORTHERN IRELAND. I HAVE HAD NO REPORTS ON THE EFFICACY or THE OPERATION, BUT THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS BEING CARRIED OUT IS PRODUCING A SITUATION WHICH, AS SEEN FROM HERE, IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS OF HMG. 
2. ROAD CRATERING AND BRIDGE DEMOLITION HAVE NO CREDIBILITY IN THE SOUTH IN TERMS OF PUBLISHED SECURITY OBJECTIVES. IT IS ARUGUED HERE THAT THE DESTRUCTION OF ROADS ALONG THE BORDER IS IN FACT NO DETERRENT TO CROSS BORDER ACTIVITY BY TERRORISTS. WITH THE HELP OF THE GROWING NUMBER OF SYMPATHISERSTHAT CRATERING IS PRODUCING, THEY SIMPLY RESORT TO FOOTPATHS AND FIELDS. THE IRISH CAN SEE NO EVIDENCE TO REFUTE THIS ARGUMENT AND THEY ASSUME THAT SInCE, IN THEIR EYES, THE OPERATION IS INEPT IN MILITARY TERMS, IT WAS INTRODUCED SIMPLY TO PLACATE MR FAULKNER’S RIGHT WINGERS. THIS VIEW IS ENDORSED FOR THEM BY BRIGADIER THOMPSON IN TODAY’S ISSUE OF, OF ALL PAPERS, THE DAILY TELEGRAPH. 
3. IT IS INESCAPABLE THAT CRATERING HARD UP AGAINST A BORDER 
WHICH IS UNDEMARCATED AND APPARENTLY VARIES ACCORDING TO WHICH MAPS ARE CONSULTED, WILL LEAD TO BORDER INFRINGEMENTS BY BRITISH TROOPS. ENSUING INCIDENTS COULD LEAD TO A DANGEROUS CONFRONTATION BETWEEN BRITISH AND IRISH SECURITY FORCES. YESTERDAY’S INCIDENT AT MUNNILLY BRIDGE ON THE CO MONAGHAN BORDER ILLUSTRATES MY POINTS THE ONLY ELEMENT ABSENT WAS AN IRA AMBUSH. THE DUBLIN GOVERNMENT HAVE WISELY PLAYED THIS INCIDENT OWN, BUT FROM ALL ACCOUNTS PUBLISHED SO FAR, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE LOCATION OF THE BORDER WAS IN DISPUTE AND IT APPARENTLY REQUIRED THE OPINION OF THE LOCAL COUNTY SURVEYOR, ACTING AS A SORT OF UMPIRE, TO CAUSE THE WITHDRAWL OF BRITISH TROOPS. IRISH TROOPS TOOK UP POSITIONS ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE BORDER.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO3 29 OCTOBER 1971 
Incidents in the last 24 hours The last 24 hours have been quieter than usual. The 
eleven shooting incidents, three explosions and two border incidents 2. 
Most of the shooting took place in Belfast. A mobile Army 
patrol was fired on on the motorway and one soldier was seriously wounded. In an incident in the Ardoyne one gunman was killed and two were thought to be hit. 3. 
Co Fermanagh where there was 
The main border incident took place at Newtownbutler in a dispute between patrols of the 
British and Irish armies about precisely where the border lay. The British party had gone to the spot to blow up again a bridge which had already been blown up some days previously and had be restored by local inhabitants. Our view was that the border lay on the far side of the stream which the bridge crossed, whereas the Irish patrol claimed that the border ran down the middle of the stream. The exchanges between the two patrols were 
amicable 
and there was not a dangerous confrontation as had been suggested in some press reports. 4. 
It is expected that when the aerial survey of the border has 
been completed and new maps produced the chances of accidental border incidents will be reduced. 
But the new maps will not prevent 
disagreements over interpretation between the two sides and consideration will need to be given in due course to the possibility of discussing with the Irish Government the demarcation of the border where there is any doubt about it. 5. 
Present instructions to units in Northern Ireland lay down 
that, where there is any doubt about the border,units are to work on the interpretation which is most favourable to the Irish Republic.

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland 
At today’s meeting we covered points arising on the Compton report and dealt generally with the political situation North and South. 
I suggest 
that on Monday we should deal with the following (as well as with any new problems arising over the weekend):1. 
General situation report on security 
2. Arming of the RUC 3. 
4. UDR recruitment. 
In addition it would be wise to deal with 5. 6. 
7. Alleged Border incursions by the Army 
The Newry shooting of the fleeing bank robbers; and the possible need to reconsider the "Yellow Card" instructions to the troops. I have discussed this 
Public relations and counter-propaganda. 
with Mr. Maitland and have agreed with him that Sir Dick White should be responsible for collecting, and transmitting to Mr. Maitland himself and to Mr. Reddaway of IRD, all the material which could be used, 
8. 
The advisability of a message to Mr. Lynch - Item 5 above is relevant to this. 
The Economic Situation is not yet quite ripe for discussion; but 
Sir Philip Allen would be able to report how work on the Cairncross Report stands.

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland The meeting at 11.15 a. m. tomorrow will be attended by the Home 
Secretary (with Sir Philip Allen) and the Secretary of State for Defence (with Lord Balniel, the CGS and Sir James Dunnett). The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary will be greeting Mrs. Gandhi; but Sir Denis Greenhill and Mr. White will be at the meeting The Chancellor of the Exchequer has other engagements; and, since the Treasury have not yet completed their examination of the Cairncross report, I suggest leaving the economic situation for the next meeting. Sir Philip Allen will be discussing the situation with his Official 
Committee immediately before your own meeting at 11.15 a. m. I suggest that the main points to be covered at the latter are as follows:A. 
regular Ministerial discussions. 
Meeting Arrangements You will wish to tell your colleagues about the arrangement for It will be helpful if these can take place 
at a standard time, which can be immediately preceded by meetings of the Official Committee. Monday is an appropriate day, because a good deal has usually happened over the weekend. One possibility, therefore, would be regular meetings at noon on Monday, with noon on Friday as a reserve time to be kept free by Ministers against the possible need for a second meeting. 
You will also need to tell your colleagues about Sir James Dunnett’s 
"operational" meetings every morning and the arrangements for circulating a daily situation report. B. 
The Political Situation 
(1) Progress of the Home Secretary’s initiative. (2) 
Political developments in Northern Ireland; reaction to the Green 
Paper and the new Ministerial appointments. (3) The agenda and arrangements for the next meeting with 
Mr. Faulkner. (There has been some suggestion that this might take the form of a visit by the Home Secretary to Stormont. Would this be wise?).

You asked why Judge Brown’s Advisory Committee on 
Internment Appeals seemed to have come to a standstill. In fact, their work is continuing and the figures in the note which you saw (implying no increase in the number of cases considered over the past week) were incorrect. 64 cases have now been considered. 7 have been released (including 2 released today). They have decided not to release 48 and 9 cases are still pending. But the number of cases considered will continue to grow. The Committee say that the main limitation on their speed of working is the time taken by solicitors to prepare cases for submission to them.

CONFIDENTIAL. TO PRIORITY FCO TELEGRAM NUMBER 531 OF 27 OCTOBER, INFO PRIORITY UKREP BELFAST. M I P T : NORTHERN IRELAND. 1. WHILST DISCUSSING BORDER CROSSINGS, WILLIAMS GENTLY PROBED GALLAGHER ABOUT THE NEXT MEETING BETWEEN PRIME MINISTER AND TAOISEACH, REFERRING TO EXCHANGES IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON 26 OCTOBER. 2 
2. GALLAGHER SAID THAT TAOISEACH WOULD HAVE TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCEPTING AN INVITATION TO FURTHER TALKS WITH PRIME MINISTER. THE TRIPARTITE MEETING HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY FURTHER REPRESSIVE MEASURES IN THE NORTH, AND CONSEQUENTLY TAOISEACH WAS BEING ACCUSED OF ACQUIESCING IN THE REPRESSION OF THE MINORITY. HIS ADVICE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENED TO, EVEN WHEN HE HAD MADE A PERSONAL APPEAL TO PRIME MINISTER OVER THE CRATERING OF UNAPPROVED ROADS. WESTMINSTER WOULD ITSELF HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT SHOULD BE THE FUTURE STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT IN THE NORTH. WAS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WOULD TAKE ANY INITIATIVE OF ITS OWN DURING THE NEXT TWO WEEKS? GALLAGHER BELIEVED THAT THE CRUNCH IN THE NORTH WOULD COME DURING NOVEMBER, AND THERE WAS HARDLY ANY TIME LEFT. IF IT WAS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT’S INTENTION TO CRUSH THE PRESENT DISCONTENT BY MILITARY FORCE, THEN EVEN IF THIS PROVED POSSIBLE THE RESULT WOULD BE A REPRESSED MINORITY DOMINATED BY TRIUMPHANT UNIONISM WHICH WOULD GIVE NOTHING AAY. THE NEED FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION WOULD STILL BE THERE. 
3. GALLAGHER ADDED THAT IN HIS OPINION MR FAULKNER’S GREEN PAPER CONTAINED NOTHING OF VALUE, AND THAT THE APPOINTMENT OF DR NEWEWAS NOT A SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO BRING THE MINORITY INTO NORTHERN GOVERNMENT. 
4. GALLAGHER ENDED BY EXPRESSING HIS PERSONAL SYMPATHY FOR THE DEATH OF TWO BRITISH SOLDIERS TODAY IN LONDONDERRY.

PRIME MINISTER You asked about the period 
service of the ex-soldier 
named Seaman who made the allegations about the S.A.S. in Northern Ireland. 
The Ministry of Defence put out the following at the 
weekend (and it was picked up in the news bulletins):(i) That there was no truth in these allegations (ii) That Seaman had never been in the S.A.S. 
(iii) That he had purchased his discharge from the Army in 1969 after total service amounting to seven months, spread over four different periods. 
The detail behind (iii) is that Seaman first enlisted, 
under the name of Barber, in 1958 with the Parachute Regiment but was discharged after three months as being unsuitable. In 1965 he again enlisted with the Parachute Regiment in the name of Barber and was discharged after twelve days when it became clear who he was. In 1969 he enlisted again with the Parachute Regiment in the name of Seaman. After a short time he was found unsuitable for the Parachute Regiment and was transferred to the Royal Anglian Regiment from which he in due course purchased his discharge. He served in 1969 for less than four months, thus making the total of seven months referred to in the Ministry of Defence statement.

Ref. A0637 PRIME MINISTER 
Northern Ireland I have discussed with Sir Philip Allen, Sir Denis Greenhill and 
Sir James Dunnett the best means of bringing developments in Ulster under more continuous watch and closer control. 
I need not rehearse 
all the difficulties in the way of this objective, since you know them only too well! But we felt that these difficulties might be at least reduced to some extent if we now instituted the following arrangements:(a) Without prejudice to whatever ad hoc Ministerial meetings may be required from time to time, there should be regular meetings of the Ministers primarily concerned at fixed dates and times. These should probably be twice a week, perhaps on Mondays and Fridays. 
If you agree 
and would indicate the hour which would be most convenient to you, I will warn the other Ministers accordingly. (b) These Ministerial discussions should be supported by official machinery,at Permanent Secretary level,for both short-term and long-term purposes. 
Thus:- 
(i) There should be a daily meeting to take stock of both political and military developments in the previous 24 hours and to produce a succinct situation report for Ministers. 
Since the main emphasis 
in Ulster at the moment is on the conduct of military operations, this daily meeting should be held in the Ministry of Defence under Sir James Dunnett’s chairmanship; but it would also take note of political developments and would be concerned to give Ministers immediate warning if any action was required of them on either the political or the military front. The meeting, which should be held at 9.45 a. m. each day, would be attended by representatives of the Home Office, the FCO, the Ministry of Defence (military and civil), the Intelligence Assessments Staff and Mr. Maitland. 
This procedure is acceptable to all concerned; and it will come into effect tomorrow, Wednesday.

LYNCH. IT SPEAKS OF AN ULTIMATUM, BASED MAINLY UPON THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE IN DR. HILLERY’S SPEECH WINDING UP THE DAIL DEBATE ON NORTHERN IRELAND. BEGINS. 
IT IS TIME INSTEAD FOR BRITAIN AND IRELAND TO DISCUSS MEANINGFULLY ANOTHER ARRANGEMENT.

FAULKNER’S PUBLIC REMARKS AFTER IT (ABOUT NON-UNIONIST PARTICIPATION IN HIS GOVERNMENT).

and although what happens in the North is not directly my concern, I feel I am deeply enough involved in the Irish question to write about Ireland as a whole.

movement back to the old militant republican spirit and methods which, however appropriate to 1916-21 are outdated in 1971. This trend is eroding the position of Jac Lynch and the moderates, and the IRA and their sympathisers appear to be gaining in strength and audacity. This trend is due less to any increase in skill or numbers of either branch of the IRA than to a growing despair about our. methods of attempting to curb the seemingly endless violence in the North, and growing doubts about the utility of friendly contact with HMG on Northern affairs. I learned at Chequers that our friends are now astonished at the funds and scale of international organisation now supporting the IRA. Many of my diplomatic colleagues (mainly West Europeans) say their compatriots regard the bombing the accidental shooting of children by the British Army, Internment without trial, and the paralysis of public life in the North as a single incomprehensible whole, no part of which is either more or less to be condemned than any other. There have been indications tht the British electorate has had enough of the North. There seems, at least in Dublin, to be no hope for improvement. On the contrary the assumption is that the bloodshed and hatred will be Intensified, and more innocent people will die and more British soldiers will kill and be killed. Indeed during the period in which I have been thinking out and drafting this letter the tensions and hatred have perceptibly increased.

25th October, 1971 In the course of the Prime Minister’s meeting with 
Mr. Faulkner on 7 October, there was a short discussion about vigilante groups. In summing up this discussion, the Prime Minister said that there could be no question of giving these groups official recognition, but that it would be right for commanders to have discretion to make arrangements on a purely local basis for information to be passed quickly, in emergencies, from vigilante groups to the security forces or police. The Cabinet Office record of the meeting contains no decision regarding a public statement to this effect, although the possibility of a statement had been touched on in discussion - 
on the 
lines that, if there was to be a statement, it would have to be acceptable to United Kingdom as well as to Northern Ireland Ministers. 
Subsequently, Mr. Faulkner has been pressing the view, 
in meetings of the Joint Security Committee, that a statement on this subject should be made. He was in fact inclined at first to contend that the United Kingdom record of his meeting with the Prime Minister should have recorded agreement that a statement should be made; but he has allowed himself to be steered off this line, on the understanding that Ministers in London would be asked to agree the terms of a statement to be made by him. 
A draft statement has therefore been prepared by the 
Ministry of Defence and the Home Office in consultation, which aims to be in general terms, to be applicable to both communities and to reinforce the points made in the Prime Minister’s summing up. A copy of this draft is attached.

FOLLOWING FOR WOODFILED. VIGILANTES 1. AT LAST THURSDAY’S (OCTOBER 21) MEETING OF THE JSC, MR 
FAULKNER SAID THAT IT WAS OVER A FORTNIGHT SINCE HIS TALKS AT DOWNING STREET WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE HOME SECRETARYSAT WHICH IT HAD BEEN AGREED, AS HE UNDERSTOOD IT, THAT A STATEMENT SHOULD BE MADE ABOUT THE ’’VIGILANTES’’. HE ASKED WHAT PROGRESS THERE HAD BEEN ON THIS. 
2. DEVELOPMENTS. 
I SAID THAT I HAD BEEN KEEPING HIS OFFICIALS INFORMED OF AS HE KNEW FROM THE PREVIOUS WEEK’S JSC, 
THERE WAS SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT WAS ACTUALLY AGREED AT THE DOWNING STREET TALKS. 
RATHER THAN TRY TO RESOLVE THIS 
UNCERTAINTY, IT WAS THOUGHT MORE PROFITABLE TO SEE WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE PRESENT SITUATION REGARDING VIGILANTES. 
THE 
DIFFICULTY ABOUT ANY STATEMENT VOLUNTEERED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS THAT HOWEVER IT WAS WORDED IT WOULD PROBABLY IN THE PRESENT ATMOSPHERE BE TAKEN AS SOME SORT OF INITIATIVE BY THE GOVERNMENT INTENDED TO GIVE THE VIGILANTES THE STAMP OF OFFICIAL APPROVAL. LONDON WAS THEREFORE THINKING ALONG THE LINES THAT ANY STATEMENT SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF A REPLY TO AN INSPIRED P.Q. AT STORMONT. MINISTERS WERE TAKING A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS MATTER AS IT WAS OF SUCH POTENTIAL POLITICAL AND SECURITY IMPORTANCE. THE HOME SECRETARY AND DEFENCE SECRETARY HAD AGREED THE WORDING OF A SUGGESTED REPLY TO THE P.Q. AND THIS WORDING WAS, I UNDERSTOOD, TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE PRIME MINISTER.

Importation into Northern Ireland of Explosives from the Irish Republic 
Tne Government 
although significant quantities of explosives pass from the Republic into Northern Ireland these are for legitimate purposes. The Prime Minister has been wondering whether we might consider prohibiting the private buying of explosives from the Irish Republic either in Northern Ireland or, if this proved necessary, in the United Kingdom as a whole. The State would then buy the explosives from the Republic and resell them only to authorised persons for legitimate purposes. It would then be clear that any private importation of explosives from the Republic into Northern Ireland would be illegal. 
of the Irish Republic argue that 
whether such a ban on private trading could sensibly and defensively be imposed upon imports of explosives coming only from the Irish Republic. 
It would, of course, be necessary to consider The Prime Minister has asked that the pros and cons 
of action on these lines should be urgently examined. I am sending copies of this letter to Graham 
(Foreign & Commonweath Office), Andrew (Ministry of Defence) Wright (Department of Trade and Industry) and Norbury (Cabinet Office).

22nd October 1971 
NORTHERN IRELAND/IRISH REPUBLIC BORDER In your letter of 21st October about the 
Defence Secretary’s proposal for surveying the border, you also asked for a report on the most recent allegations of border incursions. 
There have been three alleged incursions recently, 
the first of which was a subject of formal protest: Mr. Lynch referred to this specifically as a deliberate infringement in his speech in the Dail. The Irish authorities made a report that an Irish Police Officer had observed troops taking up threatening positions some 300 yards on the Republic side of the Border and that an armoured car had been driven over the Border some 20 yards. It was also alleged that troops had broken into farm-houses or huts on the Irish side of the Border. We have consulted HQ Northern Ireland about this incident. They report that in the course of a cratering operation which took place near Castleblaney on October 19th the Royal Engineers concerned were given cover by two Sections of Infantry. The crater was some 100 yards short of the border and the Infantry Sections were deployed north and south of the engineers team. Two ferret scout cars were stationed along a road nearby and there were other cars at a greater distance away. All troops and all vehicles were well within Northern Ireland territory. 
party of 6 - 
The troops confirmed that they were observed by a 7 men including the Irish Police standing 
on the Irish side of the Border: at no point did the watchers hinder demolition or in any way suggest to the troops that they had infringed the Border. Our Ambassador in Dublin has been instructed to invite the Irish authorities to verify the evidence which they have of this 
incident and provide a map marked with details to support their case. He has been asked to keep pressing the Irish authorities about this. There is absolutely no doubt in the mind of HQ Northern Ireland that the troops have kept to the right side of the border as marked on the maps they possess.

Since the Ambassador has recommended it, we think 
this would be desirable, and I enclose a draft. Perhaps you would let me know by telephone if it is approved. Since the message may be published, we should wish not to alter the reference to "prompt and effective action", or in any way to indicate that the co-operation may have extended over a longer period of time than the weekend itself.

At your request I saw the Compton Committee after lunch 
today to discuss the note on interrogation which I sent to them last evening. 
I explained to them that Ministers now took the view 
that the memorandum submitted by the Government should deal only with the general rules and that the more detailed matters dealt with in the note should be included in their report as a summary of evidence presented by officials. 
3. I am glad to report that after a little discussion the 
Committee agreed that the Government memorandum should contain only paragraphs 1-4 of the note and that the rest should appear with an introductory sentence on the following lines:- 
"The evidence we have received from the officials we have interviewed about the application of the general rules set out in the Government memorandum reproduced above can be summarised as follows. The objectives referred to in the Government memorandum may involve the use of the following methods 
This can be followed by the rest of the note on interrogation from paragraph 5 to the end. 
4. It seems to me that this is a satisfactory outcome. 28 Oct 71

27th October, 1971 Ref. A0651 I have shown the Prime Minister your minute of today to the Minister 
of State reporting the outcome of the interview which you and Dick White had with the Comp ton Committee this morning; and I have also shown him the amendments which it is proposed, as a result, to make to our memorandum. I have told him that, in your view, there is no alternative to the memorandum’s appearing as it stands in the Committee’s report (i.e. that there is no question of the Committee’s being willing to reproduce its substance as something which they have elicited from the Government),with the implication that the measures taken had the approval of Ministers and the further implication that, if civil proceedings are subsequently instituted, the "instructions" which the memorandum quotes may have to be disclosed. 
The Prime Minister has taken note of these points and has agreed that 
action should proceed as you propose. As regards the amendments to the text of our memorandum, he was inclined to query the proposed omission in paragraph 5(c) of the words "the level of sound is not so high as to prevent oral communication" on the ground that this was presumably a statement of our view - which is, after all, what the memorandum is supposed to convey But if it is your judgment that we should be wise to accept this amendment,he would not dissent; and he would accept the other proposed amendments as well. 
This gave me an opportunity to tell him that, as you and Dick see the 
position, we now have a reasonable chance of securing a report which will put the Government’s case in better perspective, provided that we let the Committee finish the job rapidly and do not distract them with other requirements. 
I therefore showed the Prime Minister Edmund Compton’s 
letter of today in which he rebuts Philip Allen’s suggestion that his Committee should take on the three additional cases who were not among those arrested on the 9th August. The Prime Minister agrees that we should not press Compton further on this point if this might put at risk the Committee’s willingness to produce a balanced report about the 9th August episode. 
But 
he thinks that,if we are to discharge the Committee as such as soon as they have completed their present report, we should seek to enlist Compton himself for an investigation of the other three cases and we should consider carefully 
the terms of a statement, which the Prime Minister would himself wish to see, in which this arrangement might be announced and be reconciled with the Government’s earlier undertaking that the Compton Committee would deal with certain of the post-9th August cases.

THE COMPTON COMMITTEE 1. 
Sir Dick White and I attended the Compton Committee this 
morning and there is one point which I think I ought to put to you at once. Sir Dick White and I will be discussing this with Sir Burke Trend and Sir Philip Allen at 2.45 p.m. today. 
2. The point relates to the memorandum which has been sent 
across to the Compton Committee about interrogation as a memorandum submitted to the Committee by HMG. Sir Edmund began by saying that when the document had been handed to him by Sir Philip Allen he understood that the Government were positively requesting the Committee to include the memorandum in their report. I did not myself appreciate that we wished to go quite so far and I did not think it tactically wise at that stage in the proceedings to press the point too hard. 
3. Later in the discussion, however, both Sir Dick White and I 
got the impression that Sir Edmund was himself coming to the view that there would be real and positive advantages in including the Government note in the report and that the other two members did not object. We were asked several times by the medical member whether we were really satisfied that the publication of the note in the report was in the Governments interest. The points which seemed to be bothering him were that he doubted whether formal publication of the note would be in the interests of the British Army for which he had a high regard or, indeed, in the interests of Ministers themselves, since they would be formally announcing that these techniques had their approval. 
4. bound - 
Sir Dick White and I are both satisfied that Ministers are in view of what has already been published - 
to make 
their position clear and that it is an advantage that the note should be contained in the context of the Compton Report. 
5. DGI has also confirmed what he has said before that in view 
of what has already been published, there is no security objection to this course and that given this there is advantage in the Committee publishing the note in their report.

5. The Minister asked if we could prove that some of the 
subjects asked to be hooded in their individual cells. DGI said there was no taped record of this and the only person who could possibly vouch for it was Colonel Nicholson who was there at the time. 
The reason why the subjects 
wanted to be hooded was that there were windows in the cells. 6. 
The Minister questioned what para. 6 of DGI’s minute DGI explained that if a subject had not 
meant in referring to the limits of the Geneva Convention and JIC(65)15. 
given information after five days it was usually accepted that there was then a danger of exceeding the guidelines laid down by JIC(65)15 and the Geneva Convention - which of course was intended to apply to civilians in similar circumstances.

The Compton Enquiry was appointed by the Home Secretary on 31 August to 
investigate allegations of physical brutality made by persona arrested on 9 August under the Special Powers Act. 
The Sunday Times article on 17 October, in dealing with the allegations 
of such persons who were specially interrogated, suggested that the terms of reference of the Compton Enquiry had been drafted with the intention of excluding them. The No 10 Statement of 18 October said that they were within the scope of the Enquiry. 
This statement was not made after any amendment or extension of the Enquiry’s 
original terms of reference. For the Home Secretary in his letter of appointment of 31 August specifically asked the Committee to investigate complaints of physical brutality in respect of a small number of persons who were interrogated in depth after a detention order had been made against them and told the Committee that the terms of reference had been drawn to include such persons. In fact, the Committee had already investigated several such allegations transmitted to them from other sources before the Sunday Times article of 17 October revealed that that newspaper held such allegations. 
A check of the 14 names mentioned in the Sunday Times article of 
17 October has established that 11 are persons arrested on 9 August. The Compton Committee on 19 October collected from the Sunday Times the information upon which that article was based, and that insofar as it consists of allegations by persons arrested on 9 August, it will be investigated and covered in the forthcoming Report. 
The Committee have received enquiries from the Press, Members of 
Parliament and other quarters as to whether they will now extend their investigation to include allegations of ill-treatment connected with the 3 other names in the Sunday Times article and a further 5 names mentioned by Mr Kevin MacNamara MP. 
The Committee has so far (Sunday, 24 October) avoided giving any answer. 
But what they want to say in reply is that they were appointed to investigate complaints from those arrested on 9 August; they have finished taking evidence

25th October, 1971 Ref. A0635 Northern Ireland Interrogation Dick and I have discussed the draft text of the statement for Compton 
which your Private Secretary sent to Dick under cover of his letter of today MG/71/1107. We should like to suggest the following amendments:- 
(1) Paragraph 1 Amend the last sentence to read: 
"The latest instructions on the rules to be followed were issued in 1965 and were revised in 1967 to provide for the daily inspection by a medical officer in the light of the recommendations 
(2) Paragraph 4 We feel that,if (as was agreed this morning) this document is to be published or at least publishable,its references to "fatigue" should be deleted. On this basis the first sentence might read: 
"Information can be obtained more rapidly if the person being interrogated is subjected to strict discipline and isolation with a restricted diet; but violence or humiliating treatment 
(3) Paragraph 5 There is a significant difference in the order of presentation as between (a) on the one hand and (b) and (c) on the other hand. In dealing with Wall Standing the document discusses first the security and handling aspects of the question and only subsequently discusses the value of the technique in relation to interrogation. 
But when it comes to Hooding and Noise it reverses 
the order and deals with the interrogation aspect first and only thereafter with the contribution which these techniques can make to the secure handling of the prisoners. Would it not be wiser to revers the order in (b) and (c) in order to bring it into line with the order (a),which is not only preferable in a publisheddocument but more in accordance with the correct doctrine? 
(4) Paragraph 5(c) Delete: " (5) Paragraph 5(d) Delete: ". .. .

Post-1965 there has been Aden, and the RUC Special Branch It is perhaps a point 
worth making that the Services developed the techniques of interrogation in order to train our own people to resist them, and each use of the various techniques has been tested against our own people over the years in the interrogation phase of escape and evasion exercises some of which have involved other nationalities in NATO. 
The 
interrogation phase in these exercises has on several occasions been checked by Service psychiatric consultants to make sure that no participant would suffer any damage.

concerned only with Aden: it does not discuss or reveal interrogation techniques but concerns itself only with the Interrogation Centre. There were two main general points. 
The first on mandatory medical examinations and medical weight records I have mentioned. The second 
was that future interrogation should be undertaken by civilians, meaning presumably police forces. 
I agree absolutely with this as a 
general principle,and in Northern Ireland the RUC conduct the interrogations and personnel of the Joint School of Intelligence are there only to advise and support. 
It has, however, proved impossible to 
transfer either the advisory or the training responsibility because no other organisation maintains an interrogation team in being.

PS/MINISTER OF STATE NORTHERN IRELAND: INTERROGATION 
During the Secretary of State’s meeting this 
morning with the Minister of State, CDS, CGS, PUS, GOC Northern Ireland and AUS(GS), there was some discussion of the present position on the Compton investigation and the recent Sunday Times article about the methods used to interrogate in depth IRA suspects who had been detained for internment. 
2. CGS said that the GOC was anxious to have guidance 
on what to say to the RUC Special Branch about how far HMG would be able to protect them from having to bear the brunt of any criticisms of interrogation methods which resulted from the Compton inquiry. S of S said that, while he quite understood how fragile the morale of the RUC Special Branch was, he found it difficult to answer the GOC’s question. As he saw the situation, once the Compton report had been submitted 
- and, 
according to present expectations, had criticised some of the interrogation methods as amounting to ill-treatment, though not brutality 
- the British Government would 
probably take the line that the techniques in question were those which had been used in all the other emergencies in recent years; that they had been taught. by the Joint Services Intelligence Wing to the RUC; and that they had then been used in Northern Ireland with the broad 
knowledge and the approval of HMG. He did not see how it would be possible to avoid saying that the actual interrogation had been conducted by the RUC. 
3. S of S added that he hoped this was in fact what 
had happened. It had certainly always been his firm intention that the Army’s participation in the interrogation process should be confined to providing back-up in the sense of expert advice and technical support; he therefore found it difficult to understand why it was that we now anticipated much of the criticism being directed at the Army. CGS confirmed that S of S’s understanding was in fact correct, i.e. that the Army team at Ballykelly had confined itself to the support role. The GOC said that he had certainly encouraged the RUC to

SIR EDMUND COMPTON’S REPORT I have discussed with DGI his minute DGI/101 of 18 October 
to you. He agrees that if we are to seek any deletions from 
Sir Edmund Compton’s report on security grounds, we shall need to put forward precise proposals and to support those proposals with a precise statement of grounds in each particular case. 
2. Following the Prime Minister’s meeting yesterday, the 
Cabinet Office and Home Office have asked that we should, as soon as possible, conduct a detailed scrutiny of the Compton Report, and put forward any proposals that we may have for changes in it. 
3. In the detailed scrutiny of the Compton Report, I suggest 
that in addition to points of security there are two other aspects that we should keep in mind:- 
(a) Points of the kind mentioned in para 7 of my note of 15 October, which you forwarded to the Secretary of State on the same day. 
that they were kept hooded for something like 41/2 out of 5 days. Records held in the Defence Intelligence Staff and presumably identical with the evidence submitted to the Compton Inquiry show that the detainees were kept fully hooded except when fed or interrogated while they were together in number in the detention room, but were not hooded while they were in their own cells. The effect of this is that the total times in which the two detainees examined by Compton were hooded were some 45 hours and 39 hours respectively. 
I do not think that it would be 
unfair (provided that further enquiry of JSIW bears this out) to check that Sir Edmund Compton has correctly recorded the evidence presented to him 
- this without prejudice to 
the conclusions that he and his colleagues may see fit to draw from the evidence presented to him on points of this kind. 
(b) The possibility that Sir Edmund Compton has incorrectly understood or incorrectly recorded evidence presented to him. For example on page 14 he says that the persons supervising the operations confirm in their oral evidence that the detainees were kept fully hooded except when fed or interrogated. 
The natural conclusion from this is 19 October 1971 AUS(GS)

13 October 1971 
Sir Philip Allen GCB Home Office Whitehall LONDON S W 1 
I enclose the draft of the section of the Northern Ireland Detainee Enquiry dealing with the complaints made of physical brutality in respect of 2 of the persons who were interrogated in depth after a detention order had been made against them. My 2 colleagues and I may wish to make some minor drafting amendments before the complete Report is delivered, but otherwise this is our final text subject to security clearance. In particular, we are agreed on the conclusions as stated on the last 4 pages. 
As you know, the Enquiry has been given unrestricted access to documents and contemporary records, and both the Ministry of Defence officer (Lt Col Nicholson) and the RUC Special Branch officer (name withheld from us) in charge of the operation have shown us all their records and have supplied us with full information about the methods used and their application to the 2 complainants whose allegations we have investigated. We were, however, given access to their evidence, documentary and oral, on the footing that it was "classified secret" and not be be published in our Report without security clearance. 
As I explained to you on 4 October, and as the draft Report will show you, the allegations which the Home Secretary asked us to investigate have produced specific detailed accounts of the physical experiences of these 2 men under interrogation. Our investigation has inevitably taken the course of testing the allegations against the facts so far as we can ascertain them, and finding to what extent the events were as alleged or otherwise. In the draft Report I now send you, we have done our best to comply with what we understand to be the security requirements, in that:- 
(a) We say nothing of the interrogation process itself, or of its results. 
(b) We confine ourselves to saying what was done, without saying if it was pert of the method (though aware that methods may be inferred, correctly or otherwise, from statements of what was done). 
(c) We avoid identifying the place, and cut down the identification of documentary sources to the,minimum that we feel to be essential in order to substantiate our conclusions.

THE COMPTON REPORT 1. 
A copy of the Compton Report on the treatment of Northern 
Ireland detainees and of Sir Edmund’s covering letter to Sir Philip Allen are attached. 
2. I held a meeting this afternoon at which CGS, DGI and 
AUS(GS) were present, to discuss the draft report and I subsequently discussed it with Sir Philip Allen; AUS(GS) was also present at that meeting. 
3. 4. I attach a note by AUS(GS) which takes account of the views 
expressed at my MOD meeting and also of views expressed at my meeting with Sir Philip Allen. 
As AUS(GS) points out in paragraph 2 of his note the 
Compton team were told before they started work that the process of interrogation was a security matter which could not be investigated. What is said in the report particularly about hooding and noise is clearly part of the interrogation process and I think that in giving the detail he does Sir Edmund Compton has placed an interpretation on his instructions which is unjustified. Having said this we are all agreed that he will have to be allowed to say something about hooding and noise in the concluding part of his report. The Home Office may, I think, take a 
bit of persuading in view of what has already been said publicly, for example in the Irish Times, that we are on good grounds in pressing for substantial changes in the draft report on security grounds. In view of this I have asked DGI to have a note prepared as a matter of some urgency explaining why we want substantial changes 
- particularly about hooding and noise - for 
security reasons. 5. 
There is the further issue of the position of the RUC 
Special Branch referred to in paragraph 4 c. of Mr Hockaday’s note. In so far as there may well be public criticism when the report is published about the procedures used, the RUC will, I think, clearly expect UK Ministers to deal with the criticisms particularly since it was the UK authorities who persuaded the RUC to adopt the procedures in question. 
6. I think it would be helpful if we could have a meeting 
early on Monday to discuss this, since presumably Sir Edmund Compton will want a reasonably early reply to his letter.

MR ARMSTRONG FROM THE PRIME MINISTER AFTER DISCUSSING THE RESULTS OF LORD CARRINGTON’S 
VISIT TO NORTHERN IRELAND WITH HIM TODAY, I DO NO THINK IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO PREPARE OURSELVES F R MR FAULKNER ’S VISIT IN THE HOUR ALLOWED ON TUE AY AFTERNOON. 
NOR DO I THINK WE CAN ADEQUATELY OVER THE 
GROUND WITH LORD CARRINGTON BEING PRESENT. THE ANSWER IS TO ASK MR FAULKNER TO POSTPONE HIS 
VISIT UNTIL THURSDAY 7 OCTOBER. THIS WOULD THEN IVE US PLENTY OF IME ON WEDNESDAY 
6 OCTOBER, BOTH MORNING AND EARLY AFT NOON TO THRASH OUT ALL THE SECURITY AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS AMONG OURSELVES BEFORE MEETING MR FAULKNER. 
SURE IT SUITS HIS CONVENIENCE. DEFENCE SECRETARY WHO WOULD PREFER THIS. 
PLEASE DISCUSS THIS WITH THE OME SECRETARY AND MAKE I HAVE PUT THIS TO THE THE FOREIGN 
AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY IS OT BACK I UNDERSTAND UNTIL LATE TONIGHT BUT NO DOUBT THE RESIDENT CLERK WOULD BE ABLE TO CHECK THAT IT FITS N WIT HIS ARRANGEMENTS. 
AS FOR THE MEETINGS ON WEDNESDAY WE CAN PROBAbLY START 
AT 10.30 AM, LUNCH AT NO. 10 AND CONTINUE AFTER LUNCH FOR ANOTHER HOUR AND A HALF IF THAT IS NECESSARY. 
THESE REARRANGEMENTS WILL ALSO GIVE US MORE TIME 
ON TUESDAY FOR MCA WHICH CAN NOW MEET AT 5.00 PM INSTEAD OF 6.00 PM.

Strange noises, which to some will sound frightening and to others comfortiog, tre out of exalted paces. Thes noikes that possib:y Mr Ian Paisley 
coming spell out would not be utterly unthinkable ac some future Prime Minister of Northern Ir-Mond. It is not so many months ago that -uch noises would have been dismissed as the %vailings of banshees, shrieking their lament upon the death of religious tolerance and the birth of a new bigotry. Certainly earlier thisy

An electiorj anus take place by Februarv 1974,. d in’etfect this means an election no iaier than autumn 19/3. Under preseta arrangements no one gives Mr Faulkner much chance against the Paisleyites.

Whitehall remains very reluctant to administer Northern Ireland directly. Hence the

MO 19/3 NORTHERN IRELAND 
NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND POLICE AUTHORITY, HELD AT HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND ON FRIDAY lst OCTOBER 1971 at 11.30 a.m. 
Present : Lord Carrington 
Lieut Gen Sir Harry Tuzo (GOC, Northern Ireland) 
Major Gen R.E. Coaker (DMO) 
Major Gen R.C. Ford (CLF, Northern Ireland) 
Mr. A.W. Stephens 
Sir Ian Fraser (Chairman) Mr. H.A. Canavan (Londonderry) Mr. E.M. Doris (Cookstown) Mr. F.E. Benner (Belfast) Mr. R.L. Yarr (Belfast) Mr. R.D. Rolston Mr. J.V. Morrison (Secretary) 
LORD CARRINGTON explained that he was, in a sense, the 
wrong Minister to be conducting this meeting, since the subject of responsibility for protecting police stations was primarily one for the Home Secretary, though of course he had an interest in it as Defence Secretary; but the Home Secretary had asked him if he would meet the Police Authority during his visit to Northern Ireland and he had willingly agreed to do so. SIR IAN FRASER said that he and his colleagues were very glad of an opportunity to discuss tho subject with a Minister from London. The police in Northern Ireland were deeply anxious about adequate protection being provided for police stations. It was a difficult subject, because of the uncertainty about the meaning to be attached to the various statements in the Hunt Report which discussed whether the RUC should carry arms in any circumstances. In his view, that

I have been trying to ascertain how things stand. As usual, they do not stand very well. A short progress report would read as follows:- 
(1) Consultation Philip Woodfield will be visiting Belfast in the latter part of next week for the first of the regular meetings at official level. We have Monday and Tuesday in which to give him any instructions which we think necessary. 
(2) Green Paper The Northern Ireland Cabinet are meeting again to discuss this on Tuesday. 
It does not look as though publication can take place before the end of the month. 
(3) The minority and the government have only just been told of Mr. Faulkner’s reply to your suggestion that he should hurry up with the appointment of a minority representative to his Cabinet. It clearly does not take us any further at all. 
(4) 
Internment About 48 cases have been reviewed so far; and there have been 5 recommendations for release. These have not yet been actually implemented; but the Home Office are in touch with Donald Maitland about suitable Press publicity as soon as it is possible to announce that the men concerned have been freed. 
The Homo Office are in touch with Stormont about the extension of Long Kesh as regards both design of a new camp and staffing problems. They are also pursuing with the Lord Chancellor’s Department and Stormont the possibility of arranging more frequent sittings of the Superior Courts. 
(5) Security Mr. Geoffrey Johnson Smith left for Stormont yesterday and is 
still there. We ought to check early next week what success he has had as regards the UDR. On the guarding of police stations there appears to be an impasse since the Government at Stormont are tending to say that if we have no more to offer than was

15 October, 1971 Mr. Faulkner and "Catholic Unionists" In his letter to Johnny Graham of 6 October Robert 
Armstrong asked that action be taken to correct the impression, reported in paragraph 3 of Dublin telegram No. 454, that in refusing to consider participation in the Northern Ireland Government by non-Unionist Catholics Mr. Faulkner has the support of the Prime Minister. 
We have discussed this problem with the Home Office. 
If you agree, we propose to instruct Sir John Peck, our Ambassador in Dublin, to speak to Mr. Lynch in the sense of the attached telegram. There is of course a danger that whatever we say will be distorted in the Irish mind into some sort of promise to ensure Catholic participation in the Northern Ireland Government: it is for that reason that I should be grateful for your confirmation that the enclosed draft telegram represents the Prime Minister’s views correctly. 
So far, we have seen no sign that this impression has 
gained ground abroad. If we see that it does, we shall instruct posts to take appropriate action. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Angel and Andrew.

The Rt Hon Edward leath MBE MP 10 Downing Street LONDON SW1 
14 October 1971 
Thank you for your message of yesterday. I am sorry that Mr Lynch should feel put out by the proposal to cut off certain Border roads but I am glad that the decision to do so has been maintained. I very much regret the press leakage which seems to have occurred on this matter; it may well have emanated in Belfast since there would have been a fairly wide circle of knowledge, though I do not think anyone in our Government Service could have been responsible because our people here were not told until well after the operation had started. 
I agree that Mr Bradford’s speech was unfortunate and have taken action which will, I hope, keep matters right for the future; over the last few days speeches by some of my colleagues and statements made by back-benchers in yesterday’s Censure debate have, I think, paid tribute to the work of the security forces and have shown a ready appreciation of the difficulties facing them. 
On the political aspect I am grateful for your agreement to publication of our Green Paper and I am pressing on with our internal discussions here which I feel will not be without some difficulty. 
I am giving further consideration to my Minority Council idea which would be linked with the proposal to appoint a Minister without Portfolio. I shall write to you on this as soon as I have clarified my views and discussed the matter with my colleagues. I hope to let you know fairly soon my intentions in the matter of an appointment to the vacancy at the Ministry of Community Relations. 
So far as the Advisory Committee on internment is concerned I understand that the difficulties which arose over the Committee’s proposal for a particular form of oath to be taken by internees before release have now been resolved. I hope an announcement about the results of the first batch of recommendations will be made soon.

UKREV BELFAST TELNO 79 OF 14 OCTOBER TO HOME OFFICE. FOLLOWING FOR WOODFIELD. 
1. JOHN HUME CAME TO TALK LAST NIGHT AND STAYED TO DINNER. HE SAID HE WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE SITUATION WHICH HE REGARDED AS EXTREMEL FRAGILE. HE WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT HIS OWN PARLIAMENTARY GROUP. HE THOUGHT THAT FITT WOULD BE OUT OF ACTION FOR SOME TIME: DEVLIN WOULD BE UNDERGOING AN OPERATION TO HAVE A PLATE PUT IN HIS BROKEN LEG: COOPER HAD JAUNDICE. HE THOUGHT THE PARTY CONFERENCE WHICH WOULD BE HELD ON 23 OCTOBER WOULD HELP TO LIFT SPIRITS: AND HE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE IN THE SUCCESS OF THE ALTERNATIVE ASSEMBLY WHICH WILL OPEN ON 26 OCTOBER SAYING THAT IF AS HE EXPECTED, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DENY THE USE OF THE STRABANE TOWN HALL UNDER THE POWERS TAKEN IN THE LOCAL BODIES BILL PASSED LAST WEEK, HE AND HIS FRIENDS HAD THEIR PLANS. WHILE I THINK STORMONT WERE JUSTIFIED IN REFUSING THE USE OF THE LONDONDERRY GUILDHALL I CONSIDER THAT IT WOULD BE POLITICALLY UNWISE FOR THEM TO INTERFERE WITH THE ARRANGEMNMENTS NOW MADE FOR STRABANE AND SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS UGRGENT CONSIDERATION WITH A VIEW TO WARNING THEM OFF. 
2. WE HAD SOME DISCUSSION OF MR FAULKNER’S PROPOSED GREEN PAPER AND HUME WAS NOT DISPOSED TO THINK THAT WE WERE BEHIND IT. WHEN HE EXPRESSED REGRET THAT HMG HAD BEEN SO SLOW TO PRODUCE POLITICAL IDEAS I SAID THAT SO LONG AS THERE WAS HOPE OF THE HOME SECRETARY’S TALKS LEADING TO A POOLING OF IDEAS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE FOR THE CHAIRMAN, WHO WAS ALSO THE CHIEF PARTY TO THE TALKS, EXPOSING HIS THOUGHTS IN ADVANCE. HUME ACCEPTED THE GOOD SENSE OF THIS AND SAID HE WAS PUZZLED BY MR FAULKNER’S DESIRE TO PUBLISH HIS IDEAS: THEY WOULD EITHER BE REJECTED OR REGARDED AS HIS MINIMUM OPENING BID. AS REGARDS PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION, HUME SAID THAT WHILE ITS INTRODUCTION WOULD FALL FAR SHORT OF MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE SITUATION, HIS PARTY AND THE NATIONALISTS WOULD FAVOUR IT. (0£3 EEEEE PHELIM O’NEILL TOLD ME YESTERDAY THAT AT THE UNIONIST COUNCIL MEETING MR FAULKNER COMMENDED PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE QUOTE NATIONALISTS UNQUOTE DID NOT WANT IT.) 
3. I ASKED WHAT PADDY DEVLIN HAD IN MIND WHEN HE SUGGESTED LAST FRIDAY THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH TALKING TO BOAL AND PAISLEY. HUME SAID THAT THE FACT WAS THAT THEY REPRESENTED PROTESTANT WORKING CLASU OPINION IN A WAY IN WHICH MR FAULKNER DID NOT AND THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH HAVING SOME CONTACT FOR THAT REASON ALONE. HE WAS NOT SURE HOWEVER THAT THIS CONTACT WOULD BE MADE. THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF THE MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES WORKING WITH PAISLEY AND BOAL, AND IF THEY SHOULD EVER COME TO POWER THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE MINOKITY AND THE MAJORITY WOULD BECOME 
DANGEROUSLY SHARPER. HE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A GREAT MISTAKE TO ALLOW THEM TO COME TO POWER. 4.

SUCH MEASURES ARE NOT ALONE DIRECTED AT THE WRONG PROBLEM IN THE WRONG PLACE BUT THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED IN THEIR OVERT INTENTION. IN MY OPINION THEY WILL AGGRAVATE A DETERIORATING SITUATION. THEY WILL SUBVERT THE INFLUENCE EXERCISED BY MEN OF MODERATION SUCH AS THE LEADERS OF THE NON-UNIONIST COMMUNITY.

THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A LETTER WHICH APPEARED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES OF MONDAY, 11 OCTOBER, UNDER THE HEADING QUOTE A PLEA FROM ULSTER: DON’T UNDERWRITE TERROR UNQUOTE BEGINS. YOU ARE TO BE COMMENDED FOR YOUR SEPT 29 EDITORIAL, QUOTE MODEST 
ADVANCE ON ULSTER, UNQUOTE AND FOR THE REALISTIC ANALYSiS OF THE SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THAT PROVINCE, OF ALL RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, ARE TIRED OF THE SENSELESS SLAUGHTER AND CARNAGE BEING PERPETRATED BY THE I.R.A. CARDINAL CONWAY AND THE IRISH ROMAN CATHOLIC BISHOPS HAVE COME OUT 
WITH A RINGIN DENUNCIATION OF THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. JERRY FITT, THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONALIST OPPOSITION, HAS CONDEMNED THE PROVISIONAL IRA FOR ITS QUOTE BRUTAL REJECTION OF THE BISHOPS’ PEACE PLEA UNQUOTE. KEVIN STREET, A LEADER OF THE SINN FEIN, SAID THAT THE TERRORISM QUOTE IS THE PRODUCT OF MADMEN LIVING IN A WORLD OF HATE AND INHUMANITY UNQOUTE. ALL PROTESTANT CHURCH AND POLITICAL LEADERS HAVE BEEN OUTSPOKEN IN THEIR CONDEMNATION OF THE VIOLENCE. NOW THE THREE PRIME MINISTERS HAVE UNITED THEIR VOICES IN AN APPEAL FOR THIS MADNESS TO BE BROUGHT TO AN END. THUS WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE A RAY OF HOPE, AND THE ADVOCATES OF RECONCILIATION CAN BE ENCOURAGED. HOWEVER, THIS SPIRIT MUST PREVAIL JUST AS MUCH IN NEW YORK AS 
IN BELFAST OR DUBLIN. THE TERRORISTS ARE BEING ARMED AND FINANCED BY GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES, LARGELY IN THE METROPOLITAN NEW YORK AREA. UNTHINKING AMERICANS ARE BEINGSOLICITED ON THE SIDEWALKS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE QUOTE IRISH FREEDOM UNQUOTE MOVEMENT, LITTLE REAL IZ ING THE HORRIBLE END USE TO WHICH THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE PUT.

TO IMMEDIATE DUBLIN TELNO 236 OF 12 OCTOBER YOUR TELEGRAM NO 478: MR LYNCH’S MESSAGE. PLEASE CONVEY FOLLOWING REPLY FROM PRIME MINISTER TO MR LYNCH. BEGINS I HAVE RECEIVED YOUR MESSAGE OF 9 OCTOBER IN REPLY TO MY ACCOUNT 
OF MY FURTHER TALKS WITH MR. FAULKNER. I CAN WELL UNDERSTAND YOUR DISLIKE OF THE MEASURES WHICH WE FEEL OBLIGED TO TAKE TO SECURE A BETTER CONTROL OF THE PASSAGE OF MEN AND MATERIALS ACROSS THE BORDER FROM THE REPUBLIC TO NORTHERN IRELAND. 
I TOO DISLIKE BEING 
PUT IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO TAKE THESE MEASURES, FOR THEY WILL BE COSTLY IN MANPOWER AND, GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE FRONTIER, WILL BE ABLE TO RESTRICT RATHER THAN ENTIRELY TO PREVENT THE ILLEGAL PASSAGE OF TERRORISTS WITH THEIR GUNS AND EXPLOSIVES. THAT THEY GO ACROSS WITH IMPUNITY AT PRESENT IS SHOWN BY THE PUBLIC STATEMENT OF JOE CAHILL. THE RESTRICTION OF SUCH MEN AND THEIR MATERIAL WILL ASSIST THE SECURITY AUTHORITIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN REDUCING THE EFFECT OF THE VIOLENCE FOR WHICH MEN LIKE HIM ARE RESPONSIBLE. I CANNOT REFUSE MY APPROVAL FOR THE NECESSARY MEASURES. 
2. THE FACT IS THAT THE SITUATION DOES NOT PERMIT US TO WITHHOLD ANY EFFICTIVE MEASURES WHILE WAITING FOR PROGRESS ON THE POLITICAL FRONT. THE RATE OF SUCH PROGRESS IS NOT DEPENDENT ALONE ON US AND THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND. IF IT IS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE VIEWS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MINORITY, AS WE WISH IT TO DO, THEN THE LATTER MUST COME FORWARD AND TAKE PART IN THE DISCUSSIONS WHICH WE ARE ANXIOUS TO HOLD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. IT IS THEIR REFUSAL WHICH IS HOLDING THINGS UP. 
3. YOU MIDJUDGE BRIAN FAULKNER’S READINESS TO CONTINUE WITH THE ALREADY SUBSTANTIAL PROGRAMME OF REFORM. DURING OUR TALKS AT CHEQUERS HE TOLD YOU OF SOME OF THE MEASURES WHICH WERE IN HIS DRAFT GREEN PAPER. WE HAVE ENCOURAGED HIM TO DELAY PUBLICATION IN THE HOPE THAT HIS PROPOSALS WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IF FIRST DISCUSSED WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MINORITY. AS THE LATTER ARE STILL REFUSING THEIR COOPERATION, I DO NOT THINK THAT WE CAN RESTRAIN HIM ANY LONGER FROM PUBLISHING HIS PROPOSALS AND THESE /ARE

12 October, 1971 Message to Mr. Faulkner I told you on the telephone this morning that the 
Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary was content with the draft message for the Prime Minister to send to Mr. Faulkner. I also told you that since then Sir Alec has wondered whether paragraph 4 of the draft might be somewhat stiffened. A form of words is suggested below which would replace the existing fourth paragraph except for the first sentence. Sir Alec Douglas-Home recognises that it must be for the Home Secretary to decide how far he can push Mr. Faulkner on these lines. 
"Steps to broaden the base of your Government are clearly essential and urgent. I should therefore be grateful if you would let me know what you propose about a council representative of the Minority, and also about the filling of the vacancy which currently exists in the Ministry of Community Relations. I am concerned to give substance to the Home Secretary’s pledge to give representatives of the Minority an active, permanent and guaranteed role in the life and public affairs of Northern Ireland." 
I am sending copies of this letter to Peter Gregson, Tony Stephens and Brian Norbury. 
G. Angel, Esq., Home Office, 
Whitehall, S.W.1.

UKREP TEL NO 76 OF 12 OCTOBER FOLLOWING FOR WOODFIELD 1. 
THAT HE EXPECTED TO GET AN 80 PER CENT MAJORITY AT THE UNIONIST COUNCIL MEETING THE FOLLOWING DAY. OF HIM WAS DEFEATED BY 318 TO 199. 
MR FAULKNER TOLD THE PRIME MINISTER LAST THURSDAY THE MOTION CRITICAL 
WITH A TOTAL COUNCIL 
MEMBERSHIP OF ABOUT 900. ESTIMATES OF THOSE PRESENT VARY BETWEEN 600 AND 800. 
WHICHEVER WAY THE SUM IS 
DONE MR FAULKNER FELL SHORT OF THE MAJORITY HE PREDICTED. THE VOTE ON A SECOND RESOLUTION, CALLING FOR A POSTPONEMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION, WAS TIED AT 175 VOTES EACH WAY. 
THE MEETING. 
BY THE TIME IT WAS TAKEN MANY MEMBERS HAD LEFT I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD ATTACH TOO MUCH 
IMPORTANCE TO THE FIGURES BUT WHILE, BY GETTING A MAJORITY ON THE MAIN VOTE, MR FAULKNER CLEARED AN IMMEDIATE HURDLE, THE LARGE NUMBER OF ABSTENTIONS AND ABSENTEES INDICATES THE UNCERTAINTY OF HIS POSITION IN THE PARTY. 
2. THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF REMAINS INFIRM. 
SIR HAROLD BLACK TOLD ME THIS MORNING THAT TODAY’S CABINET WOULD BE A DIFFICULT ONE. 
THE PROVISION OF THREE EXTRA 
BATTALIONS DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE MADE A LASTING CONTRIBUTION TO MORALE THERE, AND MR FAULKNER WAS ANXIOUS TO PLAY THE NEXT CARD NAMELY THE BLOWING OF ROADS. 
MR BRADFORD HAS 
ONCE AGAIN OPENED HIS MOUTH TO THE COUNTRY’S DISADVANTAGE AND NOW BIDS FAIR TO RIVAL MR TAYLOR AS A PUBLIC NUISANCE TO US AND TO MR FAULKNER. 
IN A SPEECH TO A ROTARY CLUB 
YESTERDAY HE SAID THAT PEACE WOULD NOT BE RESTORED UNTIL WESTMINSTER REALISED ITS RESPONSIBILITY, 
SHOWED ITS 
DETERMINATION TO TAKE EVERY MEASURE IT COULD TO DEFEAT THE MURDERERS, AND GAVE EVERY MEANS IT COULD TO STORMONT TO DO S0. 
LATER, ON TELEVISION HE FORECAST THAT THE 
PROVINCE WILL GO BANKRUPT IN A MATTER OF WEEKS, IF THE PRESENT TROUBLES DO NOT END. 
3. IT WILL PROBABLY NOT BE LONG BEFORE MR FAULKNER 
FEELS OBLIGED TO MAKE FURTHER REQUESTS IN ORDER TO KEEP HIS GOVERNMENT GOING. 
IF THE CAIRNCROSS INTERIM REPORT 
ON THE ECONOMY LEADS US TO PROVIDE EXTRA MONEY THIS WILL HAVE LITTLE, IF ANY, IMPACT ON PARLIAMENTARY AND PUBLIC ATTITUDES TO THE SECURITY PROBLEM. 
I THINK THAT 
THE NEXT PRESSURE UPON US ON THE SECURITY FRONT MAY BE AN ATTEMPT BY THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT TO REOPEN THE QUESTION OF RECOGNISING AND COORDINATING THE VIGILANTES THROUGH SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENTAL LINK. 
IN MY VIEW THE 
REASONS WHICH LED MINISTERS TO DECIDE AGAINST THIS AT THE DOWNING STREET MEETING LAST THURSDAY STILL STAND. 
WE SHOULD BE IN FOR TROUBLE IF WE SET OUT ALONG THIS PATH. 
I THINK

DRAFT MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE TAOISEACH IN REPLY TO HIS MESSAGE IN DUBLIN TELEGRAM No. 477 OF 9 OCTOBER 
I have received your message of 9 October in reply to my account of my further talks with Mr. 
Faulkner. I can 
well understand your dislike of the measures which we feel obliged to take to secure a better control of the passage of men and materials across the border from the Republic to Northern Ireland. I too dislike being put in the position of having to take these measures, for they will be costly in manpower and, given the nature of the frontier, will be able to restrict rather than entirely to prevent the illegal passage of terrorists with their guns and explosives. That they go across with impunity at present is shown by the public statement of Joe Cahill. The restriction of such men and the material will assist the security authorities in Northern Ireland in reducing the effect of the violence for which men like him are responsible. I cannot refuse my approval for the necessary measures. 2. 
The fact is that the situation does not permit us to 
withhold any effective measures while waiting for progress on the political front. The rate of such progress is not dependent alone on us and the Government of Northern Ireland. If it is to take account of the views of respresentatives of the Minority, as we wish it to do, then the latter must come forward and take part in the discussions which we are anxious to hold as quickly as possible. It is their refusal which is holding things up. 3. 
You misjudge Faulkner’s readiness to continue with 
the already substantial programme of reform. During our talks at Chequers he told you of some of the measures which were in his draft Green Paper. We have encouraged him to delay publication in the hope that his proposals would be more

NORTHERN IRELAND 
Statement issued following a meeting between the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland at 10 Downing Street on 7 October, 1971. 
A meeting took place at No.10 Downing Street today between 
Mr. Edward Heath, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Mr. Brian Faulkner, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. 
Mr. Heath was accompanied by the Home Secretary, the Foreign 
and Commonwealth Secretary, the Lord President of the Council and the Secretary of State for Defence. 
The Chief of the General Staff 
and the General Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland, were also present. The Ministers discussed all aspects of the current situation in 
Northern Ireland. They decided that meetings between the United 
Kingdom and Northern Ireland Governments should be held at regular and frequent intervals at both Ministerial and Official level in London or Belfast. 
The Ministers reviewed the security situation. The U.K. Govern- 
ment have decided to raise the strength of the Army in Northern Ireland by three battalions. 
These extra forces will be at the 
tactical disposal of the GOC to be used as he thinks fit, but their arrival will enable him, among other things, to strengthen control of the border and to follow up more rapidly the action against terrorists made possible by the increased flow of information which is coming into the Army’s hands. 
The Ministers also discussed measures 
to give effect to the decision to increase the strength of the Ulster Defence Regiment and to develop the Regiment’s organisation to increase the number of units and sub-units and thereby enhance its local character. 
Mr. Geoffrey Johnson Smith, Parliamentary Under-Secretary 
of State for Defence for the Army, has been assigned special responsibility, at Ministerial level, for Ulster Defence Regiment affairs and particularly for recruitment. 
He will be visiting Northern Ireland 
next week to confer with the Ulster Defence Regiment Advisory Council and others concerned.

4 October 1971 Dear Joe 
I am sorry I have not had an opportunity before now to reply to your letter of 24 September. I can confirm that the next of kin of every single person detained was informed at the time when the Detention Order was made. The next of kin were also informed of the establishment where the detainees were being held. 
When the Internment Orders were signed no additional 
information was conveyed to the next of kin although the internees themselves were given a copy of the Interment Order. In the event of the transfer of any internee from one centre to another the next of kin are advised 
immediately. 
I can also confirm that Judge Brown’s Committee intend to consider all cases of internees whether or not representations have been made. In this connection I should add that the Committee will be drawing up a priority list and those people who have neither requested their case to be reviewed nor have had representations made on their behalf will be dealt with last.

which is attached below. It is confined to suggesting very briefly the -L£in ;oints which you ay wish to make or to elicit under each of the headixga of the agreed agenda. I have appended to it the draft of a possible public statement of our intentions which we agreed Mr. Howard Smith should Prepare against the possibility that the i 
with Mr. Fau ’may 
SAke it appropriate to issue something of this sort. At one or two points this morning the discussion was inconcunive, 
r 
either in substance or in terms of the advisability of mentioning aparticular issue to Mr. Faulkner at all. In the annotated agenda these points are in square brackets. As regards Item A - 
improvement in contact between 
London and Belfast - the text is nomnore than-a cock-shy; and you may weU wish to leave this point to the end of the meeting rather than to tackle it at the 
beginning. But I think that the Homo Office, so far as they are concernd, would go along with the suggetion of a monthlymeeting with Mr. Faulkner and a fortnightly meeting at the official level.

The Payment for Debt (Emergency Provisions) Bill, published today (Wednesday, 6 October 1971), proposes measures to ensure that money owed to Government Departments or local or public authorities is paid. The Bill is aimed at those withholding payments because of the civil disobedience campaign. The measure would apply to all forms of government payments and all debts for public service, and could be applied, if necessary, to private landlords and building societies and their tenants and clients. The debts would be paid by allocation from State payments, including social security payments such as supplementary benefits, national insurance benefits and family allowances. The money would be transferred from the department making the payments to the department or authority to whom the money was owed. Accumulated arrears would be recovered in instalments in such a way as to avoid hardship. The Bill proposes that the paying authority should tell the debtor that an allocation is being made on his behalf. As well, the Bill covers debtors who are not receiving payments from the State. The Bill proposes that this would be done through the Enforcement of Judgments Office. An application for enforcement would be made, and the debtor would then have seven days to show cause why an emergency enforcement order should not be made against him. Among the orders which could be made would be an attachment of earnings order, under which deductions would be made from the debtor’s wages. If an order of this type was made, the personal and family obligation of the debtor would have to be taken into account when the amount to be deducted was assessed.

UKREP BELFAST TELNO 75 OF 6 OCTOBER. FOLLOWING FOR WOODFIELD. , 
THE AUTHORITIES HERE ARE FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO 
PROVIDE SUFFICIENT ACCOMMODATION FOR THE INCREASING NUMBER OF DETAINEES AND INTERNEES. 180 INTERNEES ARE AT PRESENT HELD IN LONG KESH, 40 AT CRUMLIN JAIL AND 84 DETAINEES AT CRUMLIN JAIL. CONDITIONS AT LONG KESH ARE ALREADY TOO CROWDED: CRUMLIN HAS ALREADY HAD TO RELEASE SOME CONVICTED PRISONERS BEFORE THEIR TIME TO GIVE ACCOMMODATION FOR DETAINEES AND INTERNEES: UNLESS THE PRISON’S NORMAL FUNCTION IS TO BE SERIOUSLY CURTAILED IT CANNOT BE USED TO PROVIDE LONG TERM ACCOMMODATION FOR DETAINEES AND INTERNEES. 
2. THE COMPLETION OF FURTHER COMPOUNDS AT LONG KESH WILL RAISE THE CAPACITY THERE TO 380 BY THE END OF NOVEMBER. BUT IF ARRESTS CONTINUE AT THEIR CURRENT NETT RATE OF 25 A WEEK. THERE WILL BY THEN BE A NEED FOR 480 PLACES. BY THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY 605 PLACES WILL BE REQUIRED. 
3. THE POLICE AND THE ARMY ARE FIRM IN THE VIEW THAT THE INTELLIGENCE THEY ARE NOW REAPING FROM THE INTERNMENT OPERATION MUST BE EXPLOITED TO THE FULL, AND USED IN A CONTINUING EFFORT TO ROLL UP THE IRA. AT THE LAST TWO DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS MEETINGS GREAT STRESS HAS BEEN LAID ON THE FOOLISHNESS OF ALLOWING THE ARREST RATE TO BE DETERMINED BY THE ACCOMMODATION AVAILABLE. 
3. IT IS THEREFORE PROPOSED THAT A FURTHER 335 PLACES SHOULD BE CREATED BY: 
(A)PROVIDING 80 IN ARMAGH PRISON. THE PRISONERS THERE TO BE MOVED TO CASTLEDILLON OPEN PRISON, WHICH 
NNIS NOT AT PRESENT IN OPERATION. THIS IS BEING THOROUGHLY EXPLORED AND ASSUMING THERE ARE NO SNAGS THE EXTRA ACCOMMODATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN TWO WEEKS: 
(B) BUILDING A FURTHER THREE COMPOUNDS AT LONG KESH TO PROVIDE 255 PLACES. THIS REQUIRES THE APPROVAL OF THE UK GOVERNMENT SINCE THE EXTENSION WOULD HAVE TO BE BUILT BY THE ROYAL ENGINEERS. HQNI ARE SEEKING THIS APPROVAL FROM THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE, AND IN VIEW OF THE OBVIOUS POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF AN EXTENSION, I AM WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE FOREWARNING YOU OF THIS.

REP BELFAST TELNO 74 OF 5 OCTOBER TO HOME OFFICE. 
FOR MR H F T SMITH. VISIT OF MPS TO CRUMLIN AND LONG KESH. 
THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE OPPORTUNITY (BUT NO RELUCTANCE) FOR TALK WITH THE MPS FOLLOWING THEIR OWN TALKS WITH THE INTERNEES: I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO SOME MEMBERS BRIEFLY THIS MORNING ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN CRUMLIN, AND WAS ABLE TO TALK AGAIN WITH THEM AS THEY LEFT LONG KESH. I WAS NOT PRESENT DURING THEIR MEETINGS WITH INTERNEES, NOR AT THE FORMAL MEALS WHICH FOLLOWED THE TWO VISITS AND I HAVE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO MEMBERS SINCE THEN. 
2. THE DELEGATION HAD LONG TALKS WITH THE GOVORNER OF CRUMLIN AND THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF LONG KESH, THE LATTER GIVING A CONVINCING AND THOUGHTFUL PERFORMANCE. QUESTIONING RANGED FAR WIDER THAN THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH INTERNEES WERE KEPT AND IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT NO NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL OR MINISTER MADE HIMSELF AVAILABLE TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS AS THEY AROSE. THE GOVERNORS TRIED HARD, BUT WERE INEVITABLY UNABLE TO F EEEEE GIVE SATISFACTORY ANSWERS ON SUCH QUESTIONS AS WHO DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED LONG KESH, WHAT THE EVENTUAL PLANS FOR IT WERE, AND WHAT FACTORS DETERMINED THE SERVING OF INTERNMENT ORDERS. SEVERAL QUESTIONS WERE ASKED ABOUT THE RESPONSE TO SIR EDMUND COMPTON’S ENQUIRY AND JUDGE BROWN’S ADVISORY COMMITTEE. 
3. THE SEVENTY INTERNEES AND FORTY DETAINEES AT CRUMLIN HAVE ORGANISED A COMMITTEE OF THREE TO REPRESENT THEM, AND AT THE DELEGATION’S REQUEST THIS COMMITTEE MET THEM IN THE GOVERNOR’S OFFICE. THE COMMITTEE REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT CONDITIONS IN THE PRISON (THESE WERE STATED TO BE A MATTER BETWEEN THE INTERNEES, THE GOVERNOR, AND THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT) AND TALKED INSTEAD ABOUT BRUTALITY WHEN THE ORIGINAL ARRESTS WERE MADE. LATER THE COMMITTEE, AFTER CONSULTING THEIR FELLOW INTERNEES TOLD THE DELEGATION THAT THEY WERE NOT WELCOME IN THEIR WING OF THE PRISON. OTHER INTERNEES VOCALLY SUPPORTED THEM. THE DELEGATION DID NOT GO IN, BUT I GATHER THEY BELIEVE CONDITIONS THERE TO BE GOOD, APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS MADE TO HELP FAMILIES OF INTERNEES. INTERNEES DI D NOT GET MUCH SYMPATHY FOR THEIR GAKBMBBBYKHSM 
IW 
ONE MEAL HUNGER STRIKE OR THE CHANG EEEEE CHANTING STAGED FOR THE MPS. 
AT LONG KESH TOO THE INTERNEES PLANNED DEMONSTRATIONS 
FOR THE DELEGATION: THERE WAS A PROFUSION OF POSTERS AND FLAGS PROTESTING ABOUT CONDITIONS?, DEMANDING FREEDOM AND CALLING FOR MR FAULKNER’S RESIGNATION: THESE WERE PRODUCED BY A DRILLED GROUP OF INTERNEES IN EACH COMPOUND, AND WHEN THEY VISITED THE COMPOUNDS MPS WERE QUICK TO NOTE THE DEGREE OF INTERNAL ORGANISATION. ONE COMPOUND IN PARTICULAR HAD A LARGE PROPORTION OF SELF CONFESSED IRA MEN SEEKING BUT FAILING TO DOMINATE A SMALLER GROUP VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS TRADE UNIONISTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS MEMBERS. MEMBERS FOUND THE CONDITIONS AT LONG KESH GRIM AND THOUGHT INTERNEES COMPARISON WITH AUSCHWITZ WAS NOT UNFAIR. THE PLACE WAS CROWDED AND THE FOOD NOT VERY TASTY. THE WHOLE PLACE HAS THE AIR OF A BUILDING SITE. 
5. MEMBERS CLEARLY REALISED THAT AT BOTH PLACES THE INTERNEES HAD PUT ON A SHOW FOR THEM. BUT I WOULD JUDGE THAT THEIR OVER WHELMING IMPRESSION WILL BE THAT WHILE CONDITIONS IN CRUMLIN ARE FAIRLY GOOD, IF A LITTLE CROWDED, CONDITIONS AT LONGNKESH ARE MORE OPEN TO CRITICISM 
- PERHAPS SEVERE.

1. TWO IDEAS HAVE RECENTLY COME UP HERE IN DISCUSSIONS INVOLVING GENERAL TUZO. AT A MEETING OF THE JSC EEEEE JSC ON 23 SEPTEMBER HE REFERRED TO THE IDEA OF AN UNARMED NON UNIFORMED AUXILIARY TO THE UDR (OR PERHAPS MORE APPROPRIATELY TO THE POLICE) WHICH WOULD PROVIDE AN INTELLIGENCE NETWORK ON A LOCAL BASIS. YESTERDAY AT A MEETING WITH PERMANENT UNDER SECRETARIES HE MENTIONED THE POSSIBILITY OF AN UNARMED CIVIL DEFENCE CORPS UNDER THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT, WHICH SO FAR AS I COULD GATHER WOULD ACT AS EYES AND EARS TO OBSERVE SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOUR IN THE STREETS ETC. HE SAID HE ASSUMED THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT COULD DECIDE TO DO OFF THEIR OWN BAT. ON NEITHER OF THESE TWO IDEAS HAD THERE BEEN ANY PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION WITH ME AND I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THEM WITH TUZO ON THE FLIGHT BACK THIS AFTERNOON. THIS TELEGRAM IS SIMPLY TO WARN YOU THAT THEY MAY COME UP IN DISCUSSION OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS: INDEED PERHAPS WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT THEY ARE DISCUSSED TOMORROW.

UKREP BELFAST TELNO 72 OF 5 OCTOBER TO HOME OFFICE. FOLLOWING FOR WOODFIELD. 
1. THE ARMY HAVE SHOWN ME A BRIEF FOR GENERAL TUZO, FOR USE IN TOMORROW’S TALKS, CONTAINING A RECOMMENDATION THAT A DETERMINED EFFORT BE MADE TO RESTORE ORDER IN LONDONDERRY. I A UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEFENCE SECRETARY IS ALSO BEING BRIEFED ON THIS. IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE FORCE LEVEL IN LONDONDERRY BE RAISED FROM THE PRESENT THREE BATTALIONS TO A TOTAL OF SIX BATTALIONS. I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE MY PRELIMINARY VIEWS NOW, ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT YET HAD AN OPPORT UNITY OF DISCUSSING THE PROPOSAL WITH TUZO. 
2. I THINK THAT LOW PROFILE EFFORTS TO BRING ORDER TO LONDONDERRY HAVING FAILED, AND THE CREDIBILITY OF OUR MILITARY EFFORT THERE HAVING TAKEN A KNOCK, IT IS NOW TIME TO PUT IN THE FORCES NECESSARY TO RESTORE ORDER ON THE STREETS AND, HOPEFULLY TO CAPTURE THE GUNMEN OR FRIGHTETEN THEM AWAY. IF IN ADDITION, THE RESTORATION OF ORDER AND THE REMOVAL OF IRA INTIMIDATION, SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE MODERATE ELEMENTS IN THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY TO SPEAK UP, THIS WOULD PROVIDE USEFUL EVIDENCE OF WHAT MIGHT BE ACHIEVED ELSEWHERE. I THINK WE MUST REALISE HOWEVER THAT ACTION IN LONDONDERRY WILL HAVE NEGATIVE AS WELL AS POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES ELSEWHERE IN THE PROVINCE. INITIALLY, AT ANY RATE, CATHOLICS EVERYWHERE WILL BE DRIVEN FURTHER INTO THEIR STRAITJACKET OF OPPOSITION AND PROTEST. PROTESTANT SATISFACTION AT STRONG ACTION IN LONDONDERRY (AND IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY COME AS A SHOT IN THE ARM FOR FAULKNER AT THIS STAGE) WOULD INEVITABLY LEAD TO DEMANDS FOR SIMILAR ACTION ELSEWHERE, PARTICULARLY, ALTHOUGH THE CASES ARE NOT EQUAL, IN BELFAST. I WOULD EXPECT THE IRA TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIVITY IN BELFAST AND ELSEWHERE IN RESPONSE TO EVENTS IN LONDONDERRY. 
3. THE CONCLUSION I DRAW FROM THIS IS THAT THE PROPOSED ACTION IN LONDONDERRY SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN ARMY STRENGTH ELSEWHERE IN THE PROVINCE AS WELL. IT SHOULD BE PART OF A GENERALLY STEPPED UP EFFORT, WITH THE OPERATIONS IN LONDONDERRY BEING THE MOST EMPHATIC PART OF THAT EFFORT. I ALSO CONSIDER THAT THIS SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY POLITICAL DRIVE LED FROM THE UK. THERE WOULD BE A WARNING OF OUR RESOLUTION TO PUT DOWN VIOLENCE FROM WHICHEVER QUARTER IT COMES. THERE SHOULD BE A RESTATEMENT OF THE FACT THAT NO THIRD FORCE WILL BE TOLERATED AND THAT THOSE WHO ADVOCATE IT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO PREVAIL. A REFERENCE TO INTERNMENT SHOULD INCLUDE THE POINTS IN PARAGRAPH 2 OF MY TELEGRAM NO 71 
. THERE SHOULD BE A PASSAGE ON REFORM, 
AND IN THAT CONNECTION I SHOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF THE IDEA IN PARA 6 OF MY TELEGRAM NO 52 ABOUT A STANDING COMMISSION. WHAT I RECOMMEND IS A MAJOR MINISTERIAL STATEMENT, SHOWING EQUAL DETERMINATION IN THE MILITARY AND THE POLITICAL FIELDS, AND ASSERTING THE AUTHORITY OF HMG IN THE UK IN BOTH.

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland Ministers at the meeting tomorrow will have before them three main 
documents. A. 
The brief for the discussion with Mr. Faulkner on the following day (NIPMV(71) 1). 
B. A military appreciation by the Ministry of Defence (Mr. Stephens’ letter of 4th October to Mr. Armstrong). 
C. A political appreciation by the Homo Secretary. The military and political appreciations are complemented by an 
intelligence appreciation, which has been specially prepared by tho JIC on the basis of the latest information. 3. 
The problems discussed in these documents have to be considered 
against the background of Lord Carrington’s recent visit to Northern Ireland and the conclusions which he himself formed as a result. 
I think that these 
can be summarised as follows:(1) 
In principle internment has been a success. It has done what it was 
intended to do; and, although there may still be a long haul ahead, the chance of gradually bringing terrorism to an end are now reasonably good. (2) Direct rule would represent an even more appalling strain on our resources than we have hitherto been prepared to contemplate. (3) We must therefore redouble our efforts to ensure that Mr. Faulkner remains in power. 4. 
on these points; and Ministers may then wish to consider whether Lord Carrington’s diagnosis is consistent with, and confirmed by, the Home Secretary’s political appreciation (I think that.’ broadly, both appreciation will come to the same conclusion). 
You may like to begin the meeting by asking Lord Carrington to expan Ministers 
will then need to decide whether they endorse Lord Carrington’s conclusions, This will be a critical decision, since it will determine our policy for as far ahead as it is profitable to looks and its implications, both civil and military will need to be considered with care.

5 October 1971 Paragraph 9 of the brief on Item 4 for the next meeting

NORTHERN IRELAND: A POLITICAL ASSESSMENT 
1. The key factor in the immediate future which will determine whether Mr Faulkner’s Government can survive is whether he will be able to retain the support of his colleagues. In recent weeks they have shown little willingness to commit themselves in public speeches on Government policies, though at the and of last month three members of the Government did spook out in support: Mr Taylor’s recent remarks about the security situation and a third force and his discourteous behaviour on the occasion of Lord Carrington’s visit suggest that he is preparing the way to withdraw from the Government. There are signs that Mr West also may defect; in a speech on 24 September he suggested that a division of opinion might arise from discussions on the consultative document on possible constitutional changes whose preparation Mr Faulkner had announced on 21 September. 2. The Government as a whole is very vulnerable to pressure from their backbenchers and their own constituency parties and the fear that they may not be re-elected or even r-adopted. These pressures largely derive from the day-to-day security situation. There is a widespread belief that HMG and the Army have decided on a "long haul" policy and that there is some other policy called "short haul" not much more precisely defined than "going after the gunmen". The Government is also deeply worried by the growth of vigilante groups in Protestant areas of Belfast, at present unarmed, but by their behaviour apparently subject to careful discipline and control. 
3. Mr Faulkner’s position will also be affected by the Debate which opens in Stormont this afternoon and by the meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council which is due to meet on 8 October. 4. Other factors likely to influence the fortunes of the Government are: (a) An acute shortage of water caused partly by an exceptionally dry spring and summer depleting tho reservoirs and partly by terrorist explosions which have damaged main water pipes.

4th October, 1971. In your letter to Robert Andrew of 30th September you 
conveyed the Prime Minister’s wish to see a full military appreciation of the security situation in Northern Ireland and its prospects. 
General Staff. 
I attach an appreciation prepared by the The CGS discussed this paper in draft with 
the Defence Secretary upon the latters’ return from Northern Ireland on Friday evening, and a number of points which had emerged from Lord Carrington’s visit to the Province have now been incorporated. 
Lord Carrington has not see this final 
version, as he is of course away in Cyprus at present, and I am therefore circulating it in his absence 
he did have a talk with the Prime Minister about Northern Ireland on Saturday. 
In putting forward this appreciation the CGS has drawn 
attention to two points which I think I should emphasise. First, the paper seeks to meet the Prime Minister’s wish for a full exploration of the scope for intensifying military action, at whatever inconvenience to the civilian population; but, in the circumstances which obtain in Northern Ireland,the likely penalty of many forms of intensification would of course be not simply inconvenience for the public but an increase in the outright alienation of a section of the community. 
At this 
point the political and military considerations become inseparable and any purely military discussion of the pros and cons must necessarily be incomplete. 
The history of previous 
campaigns against terrorists does however indicate that the isolation of the terrorist from the community, whether it is achieved by military or political means or both, is a sine qua non of success. 
The second point is that this appreciation has been 
compiled in haste, with little consultation possible with GOC Northern Ireland and none with the Chiefs of Staff. 
The 
implications of even a slight increase in the current force levels on our other defence commitments are far-reaching and the 
- but, as you know, R.T. Armstrong, Esq.

MILITARY APPRECIATION OF THE SECURITY SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND AT 4th OCTOBER 1971 
BACKGROUND 1. The policy at present governing the operations of the security 
forces is one of maximum vigour in the elimination and apprehension of identifiable terrorists, tempered by a scrupulous care to avoid actions which are, or may be represented as being, indiscriminate as between the terrorists and the general body of the minority community, or deliberately discriminate between Protestants and Roman Catholics as such. 
It is so tempered in order not to hamper the development of 
political initiatives, within the existing constitutional structure of Northern Ireland, designed to bring representatives of the minority community into fuller participation in political life, to persuade the minority community that they are not "second class citizens", and thus to erode the support (or at least benevolent neutrality) which substantial sections of the minority community at present afford to the IRA. 
towards ending the terrorist campaign and permitting the resumption of normal political, social and economic life within the Province. 
AIM 2. This appreciation aims first to analyse the present security 
situation, to consider what additional military measures might be taken within the framework of the existing policy, and to set out their military implications; and secondly to consider what further military options would be available in the event of a political decision to give the ending of the terrorist campaign overriding priority over all other considerations, and to set out their military implications. 
THE PRESENT SECURITY SITUATION 
The character of the emergency in ULSTER has changed radically this year, and the tasks of the Security Forces with it. 
3. In addition to keeping warring factions apart and protecting life and property in 
the maintenance of peace and order, the Security Forces have had to contend since February 1971 with a mounting scale of IRA terrorism. The facts speak for themselves. 
incidents involving 230 lbs of explosive; in May, 45 incidents and 417 lbs; in August, 120 incidents and 1800 lbs; in September 175 incidents and 2200 lbs. killed. 
9 August, the Army lost 10 killed. 
the losses (including UDR) were 10 killed and 48 wounded. 4. 
Between February 1971 and the imposition of internment on Between 9 August - 9 September 
Today IRA tactics include a well coordinated bombing campaign; 
armed attacks on police stations, usually involving automatic fire and occasionally even rockets; indiscriminate shooting at individuals of the Security Forces either from snipers or by hit and run raids from cars; and cross border raids and ambushes by Active Service Units (ASUs) against customs posts and police stations. 
In addition, intimidation 
is rife throughout the Catholic population; no opportunity is lost to stir up intersectarian strife; a cunning and effective propaganda machine exploits the situation to the full; and kidnappings and assassinations have been planned. 
In short, the IRA has the 
initiative and is causing disruption out of all proportion to the relatively small numbers engaged. 
This is not to credit the IRA with any unusual skill; it is the normal pattern of urban guerrilla activity In January 1971 there were 36 bomb Before February 1971 not a soldier had been The success of such initiatives would be a major contribution

BLOOMFIELD TOLD ME THIS MORNING HAT HE DID NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND ALL THE ITEMS IN THE LIST CONTAINED IN SIR BURKE TREND’S MESSAGE TO SIR HAROLD BLACK, CONTAINED IN CABINET OFFICE TELEGRAM TO ME MISC. 146 OF 11 OCTOBER. ON THE FIRST POINT HE DID NOT SEE WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE IN MIND TO IMPROVE CONTACT BETWEEN LONDON AND BELFAST, IN VIEW OF THE FREQUENT VISITS PAID BY MR FAULKNER. I SAID I DID NOT KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE IN MIND. BLOOMFIELD ALSO SEEMED SOMEWHAT APPREHENSIVE THAT A FAST BALL WAS GOING TO BE BOWLED ON ITEM 3, ABOUT THE INTERNMENT SITUATION AND THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AGAIN I HAD TO DISCLAIM KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT MIGHT COME UP, BUT SAID THAT A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS HAD OCCURRED TO ME. WHEN WOULD THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE GET DOWN-TO WORK? BLOOMFIELD SAID HE THOUGHT IT WOULD DO SO IN A DAY OR TWO. I SAID THAT SOME NEWSPAPERS HAD SAID THAT ALTHOUGH INTERNEES WOULD BE ENTITLED TO LEGAL ADVICE, THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BRING THEIR LEGAL ADVISERS WITH THEM WHEN THEY APPEARED BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. I WONDERED WHETHER THIS WAS REALLY TRUE. IT WOULD LOOK ODD, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THOSE APPEARING BEFORE SIR E. COMPTON’S GROUP COULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY LEGAL ADVISERS. NEXT, I RECALLED THAT STOUT HAD TOLD YOU THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE FULL ACCESS TO RELEVANT DOCUMENTS AND WOULD BE ENTITLED TO INTERVIEW POLICE OFFICERS. IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO CONFIRM THIS AND MIGHT BE USEFUL TO MAKE IT KNOWN. MR FAULKNER HAD INDICATED AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE AFTER THE TRIPARTITE MEETINGS THAT ALTHOUGH THE COMMITTEE WAS AN ADVISORY ONE HE WOULD EXPECT TO TAKE ITS ADVICE. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT POINT FOR MINORITY OPINION AND MG EEEEE MIGHT BE GIVEN GREATER PUBLICITY. I SAID I WONDERED WHETHER, IF THESE POINTS COULD BE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A CLEAR STATEMENT, IT MIGHT NOT BE A USEFUL THING TO MAKE PUBLIC. 
3. YOU 
3. YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE THAT BLOOMFIELD HAS TAKEN BADLY THE SUGGESTION THAT IN CONNEXION WITH THE ITEM ON CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE THERE SHOULD BE DISCUSSION ON THURSDAY ABOUT LEGISLATION TO RECOVER RECOVER RENTS AND RATES. HE REGARDS THIS AS IMPOSING AN UNDESIRABLE DELAY. 
4. IN CONNECTION WITH THE NEXT ITEM, ON THE SECURITY SITUATION, SITUATION, BLOOMFIELD WAS HOPING THAT 
, AS THE RESULT OF LORD 
CARRINGTON’S VISIT, CERTAIN MEASURES WOULD BE DECIDED UPON, ESPECIALLY THE BLOWING-UP OF ROADS, IN TIME FOR MR FAULKNER TO ANNOUNCE THEM IN THE STATEMENT HE MAKES IN STORMONT WHEN IT REASSEMBLES TOMORROW. I SAID I COULD NOT GIVE HIM AN ANSWER ON THIS. IF THERE WAS AGREEMENT BETWEEN MR FAULKNER AND MR HEATH THAT THE THURSDAY MEETING COULD BE ANNOUNCED IN STORMONT TOMORROW, THIS MIGHT ENABLE MR FAULKNER TO DELAY REPLYING TO DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. BLOOMFIELD WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH NUMBER TEN ABOUT AN ANNOUNCEMNEMENT OF THURSDAY’S MEETING.

PRIME MINISTER NORTHERN IRELAND: DIRECT RULE Your minute of 24 September asked me about the state of our plans 
for direct rule if we have to assume it. As to legislation, we have ready a Bill providing for a Secretary for 
Northern Ireland responsible to the Home Secretary. We also have ready a Bill providing for direct rule through the Governor; we decided at NI(71) 3rd Meeting on 17 March last to hold the two Bills in reserve, but my own view, with which I think you agree, is that direct rule through the Governor is not the right course, and that it would not be acceptable politically at Westminster. 
The Home Office and, where necessary, the Civil Service Department 
have plans ready for the additional civil servants that would be needed here, and in Belfast, immediately after direct rule. 
The Northern Ireland civil service is about 12,000 strong. I have no 
reason to suppose that the vast majority would not remain basically loyal: and I do not think that there is any practical alternative to planning on this assumption. The main problem is whether there would be difficulties over those in key positions. A few would undoubtedly resent direct rule (although some would welcome it). We should have to watch the position, but I do not expect any important people to work actively against us.

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland: The Compton Report You will like to see the attached copy of a letter from 
Sir James Dunnett to which I have added a copy of the "Note on Interrogation" as it stood at the end of yesterday and before our intervention of this morning. I think you will feel that the outcome of this intervention 
has been satisfactory in so far as the formal statement of the Government’s position, which will appear as such in the report, is now confined to the first four paragraphs of the Note and all the subsequent paragraphs, describing the techniques, will appear as evidence which the inquiry has elicited from the officials who gave evidence to them. So far, so good. But the legal implications are, of course, 
unchanged,in the sense that it cannot be denied that these techniques were used and that they may give grounds for legal action by the individuals affected. On this question the Attorney-General has said orally (and he prefers not to deal with this matter in writing) that if these incidents had taken place in Great Britain,they might in his judgment provide grounds for an action for assault; that the fact that they took place in Northern Ireland under emergency powers does not necessarily affect this conclusion; that the incidents might also be held to be an infringement of the European Convention on Human Rights; and that,if they are to be defended,they must be defended not by reference to legal considerations but on the grounds that they were dictated by considerations of national policy in an emergency situation. I think that we ought to try to find time during tomorrow morning’s 
meeting on Northern Ireland to take note of all this and to consider how and at what stage the Northern Ireland Government should be told about the memorandum which we have now given the Compton inquiry. Sir Philip Allen may wish to bring the Home Office Solicitor with him for this purpose; and I have told him that he should feel free to do so. 
On the separate question of the three additional cases, 
Sir Philip Allen has discussed the matter with Sir Edmund Compton and thinks that we have a reasonable chance of settling with him on

The Compton Enquiry was appointed by the Home Secretary on 31 August to 
investigate allegations of physical brutality made by persons arrested on 9 August under the Special Powers Act. 
The Sunday Times article on 17 October, in dealing with the allegations 
of such persons who were specially interrogated, suggested that the terms of reference of the Compton Enquiry had been drafted with the intention of excluding them. The No 10 Statement of 18 October said that they were within the scope of the Enquiry. 
This statement was not made after any amendment or extension of the Enquiry’s 
original terms of reference. For the Home Secretary in his letter of appointment of 31 August specifically asked the Committee to investigate complaints of physical brutality in respect of a small number of persons who were interrogated in depth after a detention order had been made against them and told the Committee that the terms of reference had been drawn to include such persons. In fact, the Committee had already investigated several such allegations transmitted to them from other sources before the Sunday Times article of 17 October revealed that that newspaper held such allegations. 
A check of the 14 names mentioned in the Sunday Times article of 
17 October has established that 11 are persons arrested on 9 August. The Compton Committee on 19 October collected from the Sunday Times the information upon which that article was based, and that [insofar as it consists of allegations by persons arrested on 9 August,] it will be investigated and covered in the forthcoming Report. 
The Committee have received enquiries from the Press, Members of 
Parliament and other quarters as to whether they will now extend their investigation to include allegations of ill-treatment connected with the 3 other names in the Sunday Times article and a further 5 names mentioned by Mr Kevin MacNamara MP. 
The Committee has so far (Sunday, 24 October) avoided giving any answer. 
But what they want to say in reply is that they were appointed to investigate complaints from those arrested on 9 August; they have finished taking evidence

telephoned 
Mr. McNamara : I should like your the 
Compton Commission in Belfast to make available to it allegations which had been made about the mistreatment of prisoners in the various interrogation centres., I was was informed by the Secretary of the Commission that it had no pgwer to make inquiries about any person who was arrested and interrogated after,9th August. That means that the Commission ’ will not be able to investigate the cases of the 300 people who have.been arrested after that date. 
The Home Secretary said last Tuesday: 
" Intelligence is of enormous importance in defeating the gunmen, but despite that I repeat once again that allegations of this character must be fully investigated."-[OFFICIAL REPORT 19th October 1971 ; Vol. 823, c. 547.] Because of the apparent limitations 
which have been placed on the Commission, and because of the statement made to me this morning, may I ask whether the Home Secretary has indicated that he intends to come to the House this morning to make a statement about the limitations on the powers of the Commission? 
Mr. Speaker : I do not think that that 
is really a point of order. I shall carefully consider the preamble, but I am certain that the final conclusion is not a matter for me I shall consider whether there is a point of order, but I ha had no indication from the Home Secretary about his intending to make a statement.

PLEASE REITERATE TO THE IRISH GOVERNMENT CONSIDERATIONS PUT TO 
DR 0 ’ SULLIVAN BY SIR THOMAS BRIMELOW ON 25 AUGUST (MY TEL NO 176 PARA 3). ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE SECURITY FORCES ARE PART OF THE IRA’S STOCK IN TRADE. THE IRA WOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO SEE MR. LYNCH’S GOVERNMENT FORMALLY, PUBLICLY, AND IN AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM, COMMITTED IN ARGUMENT AGAINST HMG, SINCE THEY KNOW THAT WHICHEVER OF US GETS THE BETTER OF THE ARGUMENT THEY WILL BE THE REAL WINNERS. 
2. ANSWERS IN THE HOUSE YESTERDAY 
HMG HAVE CONFIRMED, MOST RECENTLY IN THE HOME SECRETARY’S , THAT ALL ALLEGATIONS ABOUT 
BRUTALITIES WHATEVER THEIR ORIGIN WILL BE INVESTIGATED BY THE COMPTON COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY. IF DOMESTIC POLITICAL PRESSURES COMPEL MR. LYNCH NOW TO TAKE UP A HOSTILE POSITION TO US, HE IS IN EFFECT ALIGNING HIMSELF WITH THOSE WHO HAVE REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY OF HMG’S GOOD FAITH IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS, AND WHO ACCEPT UNCRITICALLY ANY ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE SECURITY FORCES, FROM WHATEVER SOURCE. 
3. IF THEREFORE MR. LYNCH FEELS COMPELLED TO SAY SOMETHING, 
COULD HE NOT CONFINE HIMSELF TO SAYING THAT THE FINDINGS OF THOSE INVESTIGATING THESE ALLEGATIONS WILL BE HOST CAREFULLY STUDIED IN DUBLIN? HE COULD POINT OUT THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT PETITIONS FROM INDIVIDUALS RATHER THAN A GENERAL INDICTMENT BY ONE GOVERNMENT OF ANOTHER. IF THEREAFTER HE ADDS THAT HE FEELS SUCH ALLEGATIONS MUST BE ’’ FULLY INVESTIGATE HE IS ONLY ECHOING MR. MAUDLING ’S ANSWER OF 19 OCTOBER.

The Sunday Times allegations are covered by the terms of reference of 
Sir Edmund Compton’s inquiry; indeed, the terms of reference were specially framed for this purpose. (See letter of 31st August to Sir Edmund Compton of which Mr. Wilson can, if necessary, be given a copy). 
They read as follows:- 
"To investigate allegations by those arrested on 9th August under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 of physical brutality while in the custody of the security forces prior to either their subsequent release, the preferring of a criminal charge or their being lodged in a place specified in a detention order". Allegations of the kind quoted in the Sunday Times have been brought to 
the notice of the Compton Inquiry, who have already carried out an investigation and will include the results in their forthcoming report. Six weeks ago the Inquiry asked the Sunday Times and other newspapers to furnish them with any evidence in their possession. They have accordingly taken note of the offer by the Editor of the Sunday Times, which has now, at last, been made, to furnish them with the full material on which yesterday’s report was based. As soon as this material is supplied to them, they will extend their Inquiry to deal with any matters which were not covered by the investigations which they have already made. If so, however, their report (which might otherwise be available early in November) may be a little delayed. When the report is available, it will be published, subject to whatever 
amendment or omission is required for security reasons. At that stage the Government would be prepared to inform the Leader of the Opposition, on the normal Privy Counsellor basis, of the amendments or omissions which had been made. 
Until the report is published the whole matter is, in a sense, sub 
judice; and it would therefore be both premature and improper for the Government to comment publicly on allegations which have appeared in the Press. But they are prepared to tell Mr. Wilson - again, on a Privy Counsellor basis - that the methods of interrogation which Ministers authorised in Northern Ireland are the same in principle as those which were employed in similar circumstances of organised terrorism 
- e. g. in Malaysia, Cyprus and 
Aden - and were last reviewed in 1967 in the light of the Bowen report on the Aden episode. As in all cases of this kind, it is naturally impossible to be sure that in the heat of the moment there may not have been some over severity in applying some of these accepted techniques in Northern Ireland. For further enlightenment on this point, we shall have to await the Compton report. But it is necessary to bear constantly in mind the overriding need

NOTE FOR THE RECORD On the evening of 18 October 1971, Mr. Frank McManus, MP 
sent the Prime Minister a letter, a copy of which is attached to this note. Mr. McManus and Miss Devlin called at 10 Downing Street 
at about 7.30 p.m. on that evening. I explained that the Prime Minister was engaged and unable to see them. I said that he had received Mr. McManus’s letter. On the question of Mr. Rogers and Mr. Shannon, I sad that Mr. McManus had tabled questions for Written Answer in the House of Commons which would be answered in the normal way. The cases were being looked into. There was nothing which the Prime Minister could add at this stage. On the request that the Prime Minister should give a 
public undertaking that all forms of torture, disorientation and improper interrogation of detained persons in Northern Ireland should cease, I pointed out that any such undertaking would imply that the allegations which had been made were true. These allegations were under investigation by the Compton Committee, and were in that sense sub judice. The Government could not be expected to give undertakings which would imply that they accepted the allegations and would thus prejudge the results of the inquiry. Miss Devlin said that the allegations were not 
within the scope of the Compton Committee. I assured her that they were within the scope of the Compton Committee, as indeed the Prime Minister had assured the Leader of the Opposition at their meeting earlier in the evening.

DETAINEE OR THE INTERNEE AND I WOULD INVITE YOU TO CHECK THAT KIND OF COMMENT WITH THE EVIDENCE WHICH THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FOR WESTMINSTER FOUND WHEN THEY VISITED THE INTERNMENT CAMP DURING THE LAST TEN DAYS AND IT IS A PITY THAT PEOPLE TRY TO SPECULATE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE INTERNMENT CAMPS.

results. 
Well there’s nothing new in this of course, the IRA have remember during the past eighteen months they have made 
several murderous attacks upon policemen. It looks an though, over the past two days, they have definitely sought out police targets. they have been cowardly attacks and, in two cases, with tragic 
But this is something that the men of the RUC have quite literally faced at intervals for the last fifty years. In my view they’re the bravest police force in the world and in fact, judging by their activities especially ever the last few months, perhaps one of the most effective and efficient. 
DIMBLEBY: FAULKNER: Do you think that there will be, as a result of the 
last few attacks which seem to have increased in concentration, that there will be demands that they should be re-armed? 
No I don’t believe that this will make any difference at all to the attitude of the men in the RUC. They do carry arms when 
they are engaged in duties where it is thought that the arms are necessary for their protection. For instance the two police officers who were shot dead in Belfast on Friday afternoon were carrying arms, and of course didn’t have the opportunity to use them at all. 
DIMBLEBY: If there were demands, perhaps from your own Party, that 
the police in general should be re-armed, would you refuse them? FAULKNER: 
I will never be swayed in an way by political pressure 
whether from my own Party or elsewhere on security matters, I’ve made this clear all alone, whether it relates to internment or to arming of the police or whatever, but I will be guided absolutely by the Chief Constable of the Loyal Ulster Constabulary on this matter, I will always seek his advice, and there certainly will be no qualms on my part about agreement from the Northern Ireland Government that the RUC should carry arms as and when it’s regarded that they should do se by the Chief Constable and I don’t think I’m stretching it at all to say that the United Kingdom Government would hold similar views to mine on that.
