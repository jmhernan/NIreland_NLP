Annex A December 30, 1970 The Prime Minister has now had a further 
approach from Robin Chichester-Clark, to find out whether he would like to receive an invitation from the Northern Ireland Government to visit Northern Ireland during the course of 1971. The argument is that, if he were to go, he would avoid the charges of absenteeism which were levelled at his predecessor. 
It would not necessarily need to be a political 
event for which he went: it is suggested that it could be a musical or even a sailing event.

December 14, 1970 In the Prime Minister’s minute of December 14 
to the Home secretary (M85H/70) he promised that I would let you have a note of one or two of the 
points of detail on which he had encountered criticism and comments in relation to Northern Ireland. 
Home Office was too sensitive to the representations and susceptibilities of the minority. 
The first point was the suggestion that the quoted of this was that local papers in Northern One example 
Ireland had recently headlined the fact that industrial schemes, the promotion of which would be entirely matters for the Northern Ireland Government, had been conveyed for examination to the Home Office direct.

The The Prime Minister has asked whether this is 
a question on the constitutional position by Miss Bernadette Devlin, which in the present circumstances 
had suggested to some people, no doubt quite unwittingly a change of Government policy. 
Prime Minister would like to see the text and any 
comments you may have to offer on the suggestion. Reference was also made to a Written Answer to 
Mr. Paisley in the last week of November, where relations with the Irish Republic were described as continuing to be close and friendly; the suggestion

10 Downing Street Whitehall 
Prime Minister’s Personal Minute 
HOME SECRETARY As I told you when we met on December 7, I had a 
long talk the other day with Robin Chichester-Clark about Northern Ireland. I wanted to find out what lay behind his proposal to launch a speaking tour in Yorkshire early in the New Year; and I took the opportunity of sounding him ore generally about affairs in Northern Ireland. This led him to send me a personal letter on the subject. The gist or it all is tht he and other Northern 
Ireland M.P.s at Westminster feel that our attitude towards the moderate elements in the Ulster Unionist Party, who are doing their best to help Ulster out of her difficulties, is too much one of benevolent neutrality and not enough one of positive help. He reckons that by April or May next year the Standing Committee and Council of the Unionist Party will be in the hands of those who are gathering round Craig and West, and the Stormont Government and those who support them are going to need all the political help they can get. At the same time he feels that it has to be made clear that the present Stormont Government is 
able to stand up for Ulster and is not tied to dictation from Westminster.

From: Robin Chichester-Clark MP. 17th December, 1970. It was kind of you to talk to me the other day. 
May I just reiterate my views on the appointment and standing of the Civil Servant Observer at StormontT 
I believe that this post is still too exposed and liable to be used as a political football. 
As an exa-ple 
you may have noticed that Opposition M.P.s at Stormont visit the encumbent and then announce to the newspapers that they have demanded of the British Government through him, a steel mill, car assembly plant or something of the kind. 
This is a comparatively minor matter and I need 
not say again all the other doubts which I have, except one other unahppy effect which I believe the appointment has. 
the means of communication for the minority, in particular, to HMG. 
This is that the holder of it has tended to become There is nothing wrong in this, but it is a 
fact that is realised by the Northern Ireland Government and therefore consciously or unconsciously they will ted to represent more strongly the view of the majority ac possibly take less account of the minority. 
of polarisation develops which cannot be healthy. Moreover, the abolition of this appointment would 
be a considerable gesture of confidence in the Northern Ireland Government which is so badly needed and would be a step towards bringing to an end their feeling, which I find very pronounced, that there is still a lack of trust in both their attitudes and their judgements. It seems to me after all that has happened, that this Government would only have confidence in itself if made to feel that others have some too.
