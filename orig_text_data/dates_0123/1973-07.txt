BACKGROUND 1. 
Following the successful conduct of the Local Government and Assembly 
Elections, a start has been made with political negotiations aimed at establishing a workable Assembly and Executive. Although certain extreme Protestant elements continue to express their determination to wreck the proposals of HMG’s White Paper, and the Provisional IRA continues its campaign of violence, there are encouraging signs that the majority of the community is tired of violence and keen to pursue its political aspirations by democratic means. 
2. peaceful conditions in Northern Ireland. 
It must now be hoped that there will be a gradual return to more The degree of normality which 
eventually exists will depend on many factors including: a. 
Assembly and Executive. b. 
The successful establishment of a workable Northern Ireland The policy and capability of extremist organizations. 
c. The ability of the RUC to assume full responsibility for law enforcement throughout the Province. 
AIM 3. The aim of this paper is to recommend a peacetime structure for the Army 
in Northern Ireland. ASSUMPTIONS 4. 
It is assumed that: a. 
majority of the community rejects terrorism, 
The developing trend towards peace in which an increasing will gain momentum. 
Such lawlessness as is sustained will become progressively within the capacity of the RUC to control.

PEACETIME STRUCTURE OF THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND I have the following minor amendments to the HQNI paper:- 
The Threat 1. Delete last sentence of para 5a(2) and substitute:- 
"At the least therefore, material, training and propaganda support is likely to be available for the IRA from outside sources, to help them sustain violence as a political weapon". 
Comment - Because of the remarkably insular character of the IRA, it is doubtful if they will be significantly susceptible to direct influence by other terrorist organizations. 
2. Delete the first sentence of para 5c and rewrite para as follows: 
"Protestant Community. Protestant opinion is divided on the proposals of the White Paper as they now stand. Much will depend on the way the political situation develops in the months ahead. Although a majority of Protestant opinion seems in favour of giving the White Paper a chance to work there is a considerable minority who are not. Within the minority is an element which is prepared to use violence, whose members have equipped themselves with weapons and have demonstrated a capability in the recent past for terrorism and for inciting violence as a means of exerting pressure. It is this element which can be expected, in response to IRA terrorism or any threat of a ’sell out’, to present a threat to law and order in the foreseeable future" 
3. I strongly endorse para7. I suggest that the following should be added to pars 21d.(4):- 
’This should be within a framework of a computerised system run by the RUC, which would facilitate a rapid build-up of the military intelligence effort if the need were to arise’.

NORTHERN IRELAND: PEACETIME STRUCTURE FOR THE ARMY My major comment on the draft paper by 
which you circulated with your minute of 20 J e, is that I feel as I know you do - 
I on this subject, that it provides a quite insufficient justifi- 
cation for its conclusion that the peacetime requirement would be six major infantry units. Paragraph 20 does not argue he case in any depth, or relate it to what is said elsewhere about assumed size and capabilities of the RUC and the UDR in the future. 
2. In part, this defect seems to be an almost inevitable conse- 
quence of the order in which the various aspects of the study are presented. I would have thought that a more systematic approach would be to start (as the paper does) with the basic assumptions and the threat assessment; then to deal with what can be expected of the RUC and the UDR; from that to deduce the nature and general extent of the task for the Regular Army; then to make a reasoned case for the number of units required to meet that task in each of the main areas - urban and rural - in the Province, with full arguments in each instance (eg why it is thought necessary to allocate 3 battalions to Belfast - paragraph 20a(i) then to consider where those various units could best be sited, with any necessary compromise between on the one hand what is preferable from the operational view and on the other hand what is already available in the way of buildings. Only at this stage, I suggest, should the material in paragraph 11 be introduced, in an expanded paragraph 22. Finally, the paper would deal with the proposed command structure, the requirement for supporting arms and services and - possibly last of all - the question of training facilities. If you agree with all this, you might like to suggest some such format to HQNI. 
3. With regard to the all-important question of what the RUC 
could be expected to manage on their own, paragraph 6 of the paper contains a rather crucial assumption "that the RUO will not be permitted to equip and train special anti-riot squads". I wonder why this assumption is made and whether it is well founded. It seems at least arguable that the RUC will, in the future, be allowed and even encourage to fall in with the current trend for certain police forces in Britain to develop Special Patrol Groups; it might then be considered a fairly small step from that to having specialist riot squads. When this might happen is of course another matter: but if it happened at any. time in the foreseeable future it would surely have some bearing on the size of the requirement for

With reference to the attached sketch map: a. 
A recent security review recommended a barrier and security check at

Address by the Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, to the 1900 Club, Dorchester Hotel, Parklane, London, Monday, 2 July, 1973. 
In a speech to the House of Commons on the Irish Question on 9 June 1913, Arthur Balfour, a founder of the 1900 Club, asked 
"How can we expect the great mass of the electorate to have that vivid imagination of what is going on in Ulster when they only see it echoed faintly through the colourless medium of the nepapers 
He suggested however that if it once became necessary to send the Army into the area in strength - a course to which he was vehemently opposed - the case would be very different. 
"How will you deal with the situation if you call out the Cambridgeshire Regiment and send that over to deal with Belfast? Do you think that the people of this quiet rural district, chiefly interested in the Insurance Act, will remain dully oblivious to the tragic goings-on on the other side of St. Georges Channel? I tell you ’NO’" 
Much has changed since Balfour’s day. But his assessment of the likely reaction of the electorate remains accurate in its essentials. People in Britain, no less than in Ireland, have by now a "vivid imagination" indeed of "what is going on in Ulster". The newspapers of today are no longer a "colourless medium"; and the vivid and tragic pictures which they convey are reinforced by the even more colourful images of television.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and 
Mr. Frank Cooper came to see the Prime Minister at Chequers on Sunday 1 July at 8 p.m. 
As to the result of the elections for the Assembly, 
the Secretary of State said that it was encouraging that extremists had on the whole fared badly. But an uncomfortably large number of seats had been won by dissident loyalists of one kind and another. There had been a surprisingly large vote, for example, for Mr. Kilfedder. 
The best hope now was that Mr. Faulkner and the 
Official Unionists should form a coalition with the Social Democratic Labour Party and the Alliance Party. But this would not be easy for some of Mr. Faulkner’s friends to stomach, and it might be that some of those who had supported Mr. Faulkner would transfer their loyalties to Mr. Craig or Mr. Paisley. If Mr. Craig and Mr. Paisley were then in a position to form a coalition with the SDLP, a new and more difficult situation would be created. On the whole, however, the Secretary of State did not think this very likely for the present the dissident loyalists were saying that they would not take part in any power-sharing executive. 
The Secretary of State was proposing to return to 
Belfast the following day, in order to meet all the Party Leaders in the newly elected Assembly. Invitations had been sent to all the Leaders concerned; Mr. Fitt was playing hard to get, because be said) he did not know whether he would be the Leader of his Party, and he would have to get the authority of his colleagues to come. 
The Secretary of State said that he would try to make 
sure that a first meeting of the Assembly happened before the summer recess, but the Assembly could not meet until after the Constitutional Bill had been passed.
