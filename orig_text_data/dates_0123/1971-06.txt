QUOTE FROM UK REP AND GOC: 1. FOLLOWING WOODFIELD’S VISIT WE HAVE BEEN GIVING FURTHER 
APRIL WHEN THiS WAS DISCUSSED IN LONDON WE BOTH RECOGNISE THAT CIRCUMSTANCES COULD STILL ARISE VERY SUDDENLY WHICH MIGHT REQUIRE A QUICK DECISION ON INTERNMENT. 
CONSIDERATION TO THE INTERNMENT ISSUE. 2. 
ALTHOUGH FUNDAMENTALLY THE SITUATION HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE EXAMPLES ARE: A B THE DEATH OF CIVILIANS IN AN INDISCRIMINATE BOMB ATTACK. 
A SUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON THE MAIN RAILWAY LINE WITH LOSS OF L IFE. 
IN CASES SUCH AS THESE THE LOCAL REACTION MIGHT WELL BE SUCH AS TO OBLIGE US TO CONSIDER THIS MEASURE VERY QUICKLY. 
A SITUATION OF WHICH WE MIGHT EXPECT LONGER WARNING WOULD BE A POLITICAL COLLAPSE RAISING THE QUESTION OF DIRECT RULE. 
3. 4. 5. ACCORDINGLY WE THINK IT IMPORTANT TO KEEP OUR ESTIMATES OF THE LIKELY TAKE UPDATED. PD OR ANARCHISTS TOTAL ABOUT 375. 
AS OF TODAY THE ARREST LISTS WHICH ARE ALL IRA MILITANTS# THE PROPORTION OF THESE 
LIKELY TO BE TAKEN CANNOT OF COURSE BE ESTIMATED ACCURATELY siNCE IT WILL DEPEND ON CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THE DEGREE OF EXPECTATION THAT INTERNMENT WILL BE INTRODUCED. 
AND THE FIGURES ARE LIKELY TO BE UNDER TEN EXCEPT IN THE CONTEXT OF DIRECT RULE WHERE A NUMBER OF OPPONENTS COULD BE EXPECTED TO REVEAL THEMSELVES. 
WOULD BE OPTIMISTIC TO COUNT ON GETTING 20% INITIALLY. 6. 
PLEASE ON THE PROTESTANT SIDE THERE IS NO SIMILAR LIST AT PRESENT PASS TO WOODFIELD. L MEANWHILE WE ARE PRESSING AHEAD WITH THE OUTLINE PLAN BE BEADY TO DISCUSS THIS WITH DM0 ON 30 JUNE. UNQUO WE THINK IT

W F Stout Esq CB GOvernment Security adviser Stormont Castle 
Thank you for your letter of 27 April about providing accomodation in the event of certain measures being put in hand in Northern Ireland. I as sorry the reply has taken so long but you will be glad to know that in view of the difficulties you described, the ministry of Defence have agreed to finance the construction of the accomodation for the time being. 
I understand that work has already started and that it there are no delays or difficulties, accommodation for around 150 person will be in existence by the end of August or the beginning of September. 
Perhaps you will find it useful if we could arrange another meeting to discuss the terms on which Northern Ireland would use Ministry of Defence property if it proves necessary to do so and the other consequential arrangements such as staffing. I believe the possibility of a further meeting between the ministry of Defence, yourselves and us was envisaged at the meeting here on 16 April and we shall be glad to arrange for another meeting either here or in Belfast on a convenient date. its you already know, Jack Howard Drake has taken over this subject from Robin North and he will make the necessary arrangements.

HONIP(71) 25 25 June 1971 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 18 - 
24 JUNE 1971 Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL SITUATION 1. 
The week has been dominated by the State Opening of the Northern 
Ireland Parliament on its fiftieth anniversary and the accompanying political statements. The security situation has not changed significantly since last week. 
2. It will now have to be seen what measure of co-operation non- 
Unionist parties offer Mr Faulkner in his proposals for Parliamentary committees and wide-ranging talks, ad, further, what effect his radical proposals have on support for his leadership within the Unionist Party. So far the only apparent opposition to him has come from Protestants outside the Unionist Party, like Mr Paisley and Mr Craig. So far as co-operation is concerned, Opposition spokesmen continue to reaffirm their mistrust of Mr Faulkner, and this suggests that winning their confidence may be his most serious difficulty. 
STATE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT 3. 
The ceremony, boycotted by the Opposition Social Democratic and 
Labour Party (SDLP), was followed by a message from Her Majesty The Queen, read by the Governor, and the Speech from the Throne outlining the Government’s legislative proposals. These included measures for the further reform of local government and local services; for the introduction of majority verdicts in jury trials of criminal cases; and for the creation of a Director of Public Prosecutions and a corresponding department. 
DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS 4. 
Mr Faulkner’s speech, containing his proposals for the setting 
up of three new Parliamentary committees representative of party strengths in the House of Commons, and other important statements of policy, is reproduced in full in the Annex. At least two of the four committees (including the existing Public Accounts Committee) are to be chaired by members of the Opposition, and Mr Faulkner said that their functions would be to take part in the formation of policy as well as to review the executive performance of the Government and its agencies. The fields to be covered by the new committees are social, environmental and industrial services respectively. At the end of his speech Mr Faulkner outlined proposals for wide-ranging discussions between the various political interests represented in Stormont with whom, he said, he would be

SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT HON A B D FAULKNER DL MP, DURING THE COURSE OF THE QUEEN’S SPEECH DEBATE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONs, STORMONT, ON TUESDAY, 22 JUNE 1971 
MESSAGE FROM HM THE QUEEN We have been privileged to-day to receive a personal message from Her Majesty The Queen 
- a message expressing Her Majesty’s goodwill 
towards all the people of Northern Ireland. That theme - goodwill towards all the people - will I hope establish a key-note for this 
debate. THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 
The legislative programme outlined to-day is a formidable one. It represents the most comprehensive programme of structural and other change ever undertaken in Northern Ireland, but taken by itself it is still not enough. 
RESTORATION OF CONFIDENCE: NEED FOR A LEAD 
When I first spoke on appointment to this office I stressed above all else the need to re-create confidence. We have made a beginning in doing so, but we have not yet made the progress which I would like to see and which the situation demands of us. And so I consider it to be the task of my Government to reach out beyond the bounds of any ordinary legislative programme. I see it as our duty to give a real lead; to be ready to propose quite exceptional measures to break out of the mould of fear and mutual suspicion.

17th June, 1971 I am writing to let you know that the Defence Secretary 
has decided to make a temporary reinforcement of 1 battalion to the Arm in Northern Ireland for the period of the next wee or 
days. A major Protestant march - the White Rock March - is 
due to take place this weekend in Belfast. The traditional route for this march passes close to predominantly Catholic areas and last year this led to some serious rioting. To prevent this happening again, the security authorities in Northern Ireland have decided that this year’s march should be re-routed to avoid the sensitive areas. So far, the march organisers have declined to accept that the route should be changed; although the leaders of most of the individual Orange Lodges concerned seem prepared to co-operate, it is apparent that a hard core of right-wing Protestants are busy stiffening the opposition to any change of route. At present there is deadlock and, although the security authorities intend to stand firm on the re-routing it is quite possible that some of the marchers will attempt to follow the traditional route even if that means a collision with the security forces 
- as occurred at Dungiven last week. The current force level in Northern Ireland stands at 
12 major units in the infantry role. However, one of these will be on block leave during the next few days; and the Defence Secretary considers that in order to be sure of coping with the White Rock March this unit should be replaced while it is unavailable. 
This is particularly necessary at 
present because there has been a noticeable increase in the number of incidents of lawlessness in Londonderry during the 
past week and it would therefore be inadvisable at present to rely on being able to reinforce Belfast from Londonderry.

MINISTRY OF DEFENCE MO 19/3/3 11th June, 1971 BOMB EXPLOSIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND In your letter of 20th May you said that the Prime 
Minister had asked how much might be publicly disclosed of what was being done to counter the bombing campaign in Northern Ireland, as described in Robert Andrew’s letter of 18th May. 
As you will appreciate, control of explosives is a 
matter for the Northern Ireland Government, and accordingly the Government Security Unit at Stormont Castle has prepared a draft statement for publication which does reveal some of the steps being taken to counter the illicit use of explosives. The Ministry of Defence, in conjunction with the Home Office, is now urgently considering whether the draft does justice to all the effort that is being put into combatting the bombings (while safeguarding essential security) and also how we in London can best help to bring the statement to public attention when it is issued. I will let you know, as soon as possible, what is decided about this. 
I am sending copies of this letter to Graham Angel and Brian Norbury. (A.W. STEPHENS) P.L. Gregson, Esq.

11 June, 1971. 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 4 - 10 JUNE, 1971. 
Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL SITUATION 1. 
Although the increased number of attacks on the security 
forces in the week under review have caused little damage or injury (see paragraph 3 below) their incidence is sufficient to give opponents of the Northern Ireland Government opportunity to claim that its policies for dealing with terrorists are not working. On the other hand, reports that a full-time battalion of the UDR was under consideration may be assumed to have given these critics some confort. There is no sign of any loss of confidence by the Government itself. 
2. Mr Hume’s verbal attack on Mr Faulkner (paragraph 7 below) is 
symptomatic of the distrust that Opposition representatives have for the Government, and reflects their doubts about its sincerity in carrying out the spirit of the reform programme. But Mr. Faulkner’s decision to ban an Orange Order parade in Dungiven (paragraph 10) has won him some measure of support from the Opposition 
SECURITY SITUATION 3. 
The week has seen a continuance, after last week’s brief lull, 
of attacks of varying severity on the security forces. Four RUC stations were the subject of explosive attacks, including, again, that in the Springfield Road (see HONIP(71) 21, paragraph 7). In this incident the assailant’s attempts to throw the explosive into the courtyard of the station were frustrated by high wire netting and the warning shouts of a sentry on the roof. No serious injury resulted from this or the other attacks on RUC stations. Four Army patrols were the subject of separate attacks during the week, three by explosive devices and one with a starting pistol (for which a man has since been arrested). Again any damage or injury was not serious. A group of soldiers talking to girls outside their platoon station in the Divis area of Belfast on 8 June were fired on by four men with three machine guns. Two soldiers were wounded, but not seriously. It was not possible to return the fire. Other explosive attacks took place on transformers and private property. Arms and ammunition continued to be found in small quantities. A major arms find by the Thames

1. PROPOSED DATES ARE ACCEPTABLE TO THE TAOISEACH. HE WOULD HIMSELF HAVE PREFERRED THE END OF SEPTEMBER, BUT UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFICULTIES. HE ALSO AGREES TO THE PROCEDURE IN YOUR PARAGRAPH 2. 2. WE THEN DISCUSSED THE SUBJECTS CONTAINED IN YOUR TELEGRAM NO. 109. I SAID THAT WE HAD BEEN GRATIFIED TO LEARN OF THE NEW LEGISLATION ABOUT FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES, IN WHICH WE NATURALLY HAD AN INTEREST. I WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE HAD NO DESIRE TO INTERFERE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THE REPUBLIC, OR IN THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS. NEVERTHELESS THERE SEEMED TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL AREA OF COMMON INTEREST IN CURBING THE ACTIVITIES OF THE I R A ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER AND ILLEGAL TRAFFIC ACROSS IT. IF THEREFORE THERE WERE ANY ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES THAT THE IRISH AUTHORITIES COULD TAKE IN THE REPUBLIC AGAINST THE I R A WE SHOULD GREATLY WELCOME THEM: AND IF THERE WERE DISCREET WAYS IN WHICH WE COULD CO-OPERATE, WITHOUT INVOLVING ANY NEED TO ADMIT TO COOPERATION IN THE DAIL, STORMONT, OR WESMINISTER, WE SHOULD BE HAPPY TO EXAMINE WAYS AND MEANS. I THEN ENUMERATED THE PROPOSALS IN PARA 2 OF YOUR TEL NO 109. 3. MR LYNCH SEEMED POSITIVELY PLEASED THAT I HAD RAISED THE QUESTION. HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD ALREADY GIVEN FIRM INSTRUCTIONS TO BOTH THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE THAT THEY WERE TO HARASS THE I R A AND KEEP THEM ON THE RUN. THE SO-CALLED TRAINING CAMPS WERE DIFFICULT TO CATCH IN OPERATION, BUT EVEN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAD TO MOVE ON ELSEWHERE CAUSED PROBLEMS TO THE I R A . THE ARMY WERE INTERESTING THEMSELVES IN THE BORDER AREAS, AND IF EITHER THE R U C OR THE BRITISH ARMY HAD A HGT TIP THEY COULD PASS IT ACROSS AT LOCAL LEVEL, BUT ANY FORM OF COLLUSION WOULD HAVE TO BE UNKNOWN AT THE TOP AND DENIABLE IN THE DAIL.

WHILE ALL IN 
LONDON ARE ALIVE TO THE PROBLEMS THAT MORE OBTRUSIVE SECURITY MEASURES ON THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE BORDER COULD POSE FOR OUR RELATIONS WITH THE REPUBLIC, THERE WAS NONETHELESS A GROWING REALISATION THAT WE MIGHT SOMETIME HAVE TO STRIKE A NEW BALANCE BETWEEN THE PROFIT WE SHOULD DERIVE FROM SUCH ACTION ON THE BORDER AND THE POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES. IT IS IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THIS WOULD CREATE THAT WE HOPE THAT WE CAN LOOK TO MR LYNCH FOR MORE EFFECTIVE, EVEN IF UNOBTRUSIVE, ACTION INSIDE THE REPUBLIC TO REDUCE THE SCOPE OF THE IRA’S ACTIVITIES. 2. YOU MIGHT THEN TURN TO PARTICULAR POINTS AS FOLLOWS: A. BORDER PATROLS. COULD THE IRISH ARMY OR GARDAI ESTABLISH AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF PATROLS, EVEN IF ONLY OVER A LIMITED AREA? WE WOULD NOT EXPECT OPEN COOPERATION 
, BUT WOULD HOPE THAT THROUGH INFORMAL LIAISON 
OUR PATROLS AND THIERS MIGHT ON PARTICULAR OCCASIONS WHEN IRA CROSS BORDER OPERATIONS ARE EXPECTED, CONTRIVE TO BE ACTIVE IN THE SAME AREAS. B. TRAINING CAMPS. WE ACCEPT THAT IRISH COURTS ARE UNLIKELY TO PASS HEAVY SENTENCES ON THOSE FOUND IN IRA TRAINING CAMPS: NEVERTHELESS 
, WE HOPE FOR CONTINUING HARASSING ACTIVITY BY THE 
GARDAI AGAINST THESE CAMPS. THIS WOULD AT LEAST FORCE THE OFFENDERS INTO THE COURTS, RESULT IN THE CONFISCATION OF WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES, AND GENERALLY DISRUPT THE TRA IN ING PROGRAMME C.
