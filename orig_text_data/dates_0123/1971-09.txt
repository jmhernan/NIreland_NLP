SUNDAY TIMES INSIGHT TEAMS Donald Maitland and I have been concerned recently about 
the activities of a group of young men working for the Sunday Times Insight team. These are John Barrie, Philip Knightley, Bruce Page and Murray Sayle. I attach two personal notes on this subject which are having no wider distribution. S of S should know, however, that Donald Maitland and I consider that those concerned should be discreetly steered away from giving the members of this team anything but quotable material. I have asked DPR(A) to ensure that HQ Northern Ireland are told of our view.

Press Secretary 10 Downing Street Whitehall LONDON SW1 
SUNDAY TIMES INSIGHT TEAM Bruce Page rang the S of S’s private office shortly after 
1971 
internment (Auust 10) to ask for an interview with S of S on Northern Ireland. At that time our policy was for S of S not to take part in TV or press interviews since the Northern Ireland Government and the Home Office were taking the lead on the policy of internment. I telephoned Page on Friday 13 August to turn down his request. He said he would like to talk to an official or a soldier about the success or failure of internment. I said he must go to the Home Office on that topic. He went on to indicate that he knew that General Tuzo had argued against the policy at the meeting with Mr Faulkner in London and some of the detail he added indicated to me that someone had been talking to him unwisely. I repeated the public line taken by the Home Office at the time of internment, but Page told me his information about the GOC’s attitude came from No 10 and the Home Office. He went on to discuss the situation in Ulster in terms which left me in no doubt that his sympathies lay with the trouble-makers in Ulster. 
Yesterday I heard from DPR(A) that Bruce Page had approached 
the former Chief of Staff, Brigadier Dyball, and asked for "the inside story" of his period of service in Ulster. This request has, of course, been refused. DPR(A) also reports to me that the Insight representative in Northern Ireland, Murray Sayle, is considered by the Army to be unreliable and hostile. 
We have spoken about this and all the evidence indicates that 
the Insight team should be treated with extreme caution. I have asked DPR(A) to let HQ Northern Ireland have our views. 
One final point. It is not without inte that some of the 
names of internees mentioned in last Sunday’s Insight article are also mentioned in the story on Ulster in the current Private Eye ("Gone to Lynch" pp 19/20). This is written under the heading "Footnotes" which presumably indicates that it is written by Paul Foot himself. However, what is very evident is that Insight and 
Private Eye (who have been straight pro IRA on Ulster) may have access to the same sources.

Encl 10 to D/Min/RB/5 Secretary of State 
Copies to: US of S(Army) CGS 
PUS(A) DGI 
1. At your meeting last Thursday I raised the question of the 
procedure for authorising the use of deep interrogation. Since then it has been made clear that the political responsibility for this is vested in the Northern Ireland Minister for Home Affairs. This is contrary to the impression I received from advice in a previous case and the terms in which I approved the use of Army support. Also, on the advice of Mr. Woodfield it has been agreed that it is not necessary for MOD Ministerial approval to be obtained in each case where Army support is required. 
2. I have not been involved in the discussions which have led 
to the arrangements governing the procedures for deep interrogation. I feel though that I should let you know that I am not completely satisfied with certain aspects of these arrangements. We seem to be in some danger of losing all control over the use of interrogation by Stormont which, despite the niceties of the political and legal position, would fall to HMG to defend. My doubts are not made any less by Mr. Woodfield’s account on Monday to the Home Secretary of Stormont’s attitude to the internment orders and the activities of the Advisory Committee. 
3. My first concern is that the use of interrogation is 
authorised in terms which are not clear and unequivocal. Authority is simply given for the removal of a person from A to B "where his presence is required in the interests of justice". This really doesn’t seem sufficient, and in my view the Minister for Home Affairs should authorise the act of deep interrogation in specific terms. 
4. For much the same reason I consider that we should continue 
to approve each case where Army support is required and we should be satisfied with the reasons given for the use of interrogation before we agree. Otherwise, as I have already said, we shall lose control of the situation. Should you agree, the terms of our approval will have to be amended from those previously used, to indicate that we are authorising the use of Army support only and not the interrogation itself.

PROCEDURES FOR DEEP INTERROGATION OF DETAINEES 
the Minister of State questioned the practice whereby the approval of a Ministry of Defence Minister has been sought for the provision of Army support in each individual case in which the RUC has wished to subject a detainee to deep interrogation. 
At the Secretary of State’s meeting on Thursday, 9 September, 2. Following the decision to permit an extension of the scope 
of the Compton Inquiry to cover allegations of brutality during deep interrogation, the Prime Minister ruled that for each specific future case Ministerial clearance should be sought in London and that it could be most appropriately given by a Ministry of Defence Minister. 
(Presumably on the ground that the Home 
Secretary has no executive authority over any of the parties involved.) 
3. During Mr. Woodfield’s visit to Northern Ireland to persuade 
the RUC Special Branch to co-operate with the Compton Inquiry in this phase of its work, he formed the opinion that it was not necessary to seek individual clearance in London of each specific instance, provided that UK Ministers are kept informed of what is happening and in particular are made aware immediately of any proposal to subject a large number of persons to deep interrogation. The legal position is that the Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs, being a Civil Authority under the Special Powers Acts, makes an order under Regulation 11(5) authorising the removal of X now detained in place Y, to any place where his presence is required in the interests of justice. 
This covers his removal 
to the place of interrogation and is in effect a political endorsement of a need for interrogation (no special legal authority is required for the deep interrogation of a person already detained under the Special Powers Acts). 
4. 
Mr. Woodfield’s recommendation has been agreed by the Home Secretary and cleared with the Prime Minister’s office. 
I 
understand from APS/S of S that when he reported this to the Secretary of State on Friday, 10 September, S of S also agreed that it could be accepted and that it would not henceforward be necessary to seek specific Ministerial approval within the MOD before each occasion on which it was desired to obtain military advice or support for deep interrogation by the RUC Special Branch. Requirement to keep Ministers informed is, however, still valid.

NORTHERN IRELAND DRAFT STATEMENT 
Political progress in Northern Ireland is bound to be impeded so long as 
violence and intimidation continue; and the purpose of internment, and of the Army’s measures which are directed impartially at violence from whatever quarter, is to restore to Northern Ireland the necessary degree of stability for further political advance. The Border is not at issue. 
Nor is the constitutional position of 
Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom and, within this framework, the principle of a democratically elected assembly based on universal adult suffrage. But the reform programme which has been and continues to be carried through 
and to which both the Northern Ireland Government and the United Kingdom Government are fully committed, together with increased opportunities for participation by representatives of the minority on the lines suggested in Mr. Faulkner’s recent initiative, have pointed the way forward. 
In discussion 
between the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and United Kingdom Ministers it was agreed that it would be helpful if the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland were to invite the Home Secretary to arrange as soon as the security situation has sufficiently improved talks under his chairmanship with the Northern Ireland Government, representatives of both sides of the Northern Ireland Parliament and of other representatives of the majority and minority communities. The purpose of these discussions will be to see what agreed ways and means 
can be devised, within the constitutional and democratic framework, of giving representatives of the minority as well as of the majority community in Northern Ireland an active in the life and 
permanent role, the Province. 2nd September, 1971

Cabinet: Northern Ireland You last reported the general situation to the Cabinet on 16th August. 
At that juncture the arrests prior to internment had taken place; Mr. Lynch had delivered the first of his public statements about the replacement of the Northern Ireland Government by a body on which the minority community would have equal representation with the majority; Mr. Faulkner, however, had felt unable to associate himself with the initiative for a meeting with representatives of the communities in Northern Ireland to discuss giving the minority a more active role in the processes of government; and Mr. Harold Wilson had made his informal approach to you about the recall of Parliament. 2. 
The main developments since 16th August are as follows:- 
(a) The meeting with Mr. Faulkner at Chequers on 19th August, when he agreed that he would put to his Cabinet the proposal to hold a meeting about giving the minority a role in the Government, provided that it was made clear that this was to be within the constitutional framework of majority rule in Northern Ireland. A somewhat revised proposition has now been sent to Mr. Faulkner to consider. 
(b) Mr. Lynch’s second public statement, immediately following the meeting at Chequers; and your reply. 
(c) The inquiry, announced today, into "brutality" by the security forces by Sir Edmund Compton, Mr. E. S. Fay and Dr. Donald Gibson with the following terms of reference:"To investigate allegations by those arrested on 9th August under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 of physical brutality while in custody of the security forces prior to either their subsequent release, the preferring of a criminal charge or their being lodged in a place specified in a detention order". 
(d) The formal request for the recall of Parliament. (e) The current security situation 
- continuing explosions, notably at 
the Electricity Board offices, and continued attacks on the Army, particularly the Border incident at Crossmaglen. The GoC is to review measures to protect the Border, including the cratering of unapproved roads; and his report is expected very shortly.

DRAFT MESSAGE TO MR. FAULKNER 1. Thank you for your message, which I have shown to and discussed 
with the Prime Minister. 2. 
I agree that some amendments are required in the draft proposed 
and I hope that the suggestions I have to make will commend themselves to you. 
They are designed to meet the points you have put forward, and 
I am anxious that we should reach agreement without further delay so that we can be in a position to take, and to be seen to be taking, an important political initiative. 3. 
I agree that the phrase "further ways and means" could be 
misleading though, of course, it would cover, for example, such suggestions as you make in the last paragraph of your message about revision of the electoral system and the structure of the Northern Ireland Parliament. 
I 
suggest that if we substitute the word "agreed" for "further" it would meet this point. 4. 
I quite agree that at Chequers we all recognised that in present 
circumstances a Coalition Government was not a practical proposition, though obviously one cannot rule it out for ever in all circumstances. 
suggest we could meet your point on this of the draft statement and substitute the word "life". I the last few words we cut out the phrase "processes of government" I think we are removing what, on 
reflection, I am inclined to agree looks too much like minority participation in the Cabinet itself. 
5. So far as participation in the talks is concerned, I agree that 
the words "all sections of the Northern Ireland community" do go rather widely, though I think it would clearly be wrong to

M FCO 011340Z TO IMMEDIATE DUBLIN TELEGRAM NO.185 OF 1 SEPTEMBER. ON SUNDAY 29 AUGUST 1971 HEADQUARTERS 19 AIRPORTABLE BRIDAGE 
MOUNTED A NUMBER OF BORDER PATROLS USING BOTH INFANTRY AND ARMOURED CARS SUPPORTED BY ARMY AND RAF HELICOPTERS. THE OPERATION ENDED AT 1330 HOURS. AT ABOUT 1350 HOURS, TWO FERRET SCOUT CARS OF 14/20TH HUSSARS MOVING TO RENDEZVOUS WITH THEIR COMMANDERS TO RETURN TO BASE INADVERTANTLY CROSSED THE BORDER INTO THE TERRITORY OF THE IRISH REPUBLIC. 
THIS INFRINGEMENT AND THE EVENTS WHICH FOLLOWED HAVE NOW BEEN 
FULLY INVESTIGATED AND THE FACTS ARE AS FOLLOWS. THE LEADING SCOUT CAR, HAVING FAILED TO TAKE A LEFT HAND 
TURNING IN NORTHERN IRELAND TERRITORY IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE BORDER, WHICH IS NOT MARKED AT THESE POINTS, WAS ALERTED BY THE SECOND VEHICLE BLOWING ITS HORN. BOTH VEHICLES HALTED AND THE CREWS IDENTIFIED THEIR POSITION AS APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED YARDS INSIDE THE REPUBLIC. THEY THEN TURNED ROUND AND FROVE BACK FOR SOME FIFTY YARDS WHERE THEY FOUND THE ROAD NOW BLOCKED BY A VAN AND TWO SALOON CARS DRAWN ACROSS IT. WITHIN MINUTES A CROWN HAD GATHERED AND A LORRY WAS DRIVEN ACROSS THE ROAD BEHIND THEM HEMMING THEM IN. 
IT WAS AT THIS STAGE THAT THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF 14/20TH 
HUSSARS, WHO WAS AIRBORNE IN A HELICOPTER IN THE VICINITY, OBSERVED THE INCIDENT. HE RETURNED TO HIS COMMAND RADIO VEHICLE AT CROSSMAGLEN AND ORDERED THE REMAINDER OF THE TROOP TO DEPLOY TO THE BORDER AREA TO OBSERVE.

PRIME M INISTER FROM PETER GREGSON 
CONFIDENTIAL UKREP BELFAST TEL NO 1 OF 15 SEPTEMBER TO DUBLIN YOUR TEL NO 405 TO THE FCO: SDLP AND TALKS 
1. IF THE RADIO CORRECTLY REPORTS GERRY FITT AS SAYING 
THAT THE SIGNING OF INTERNMENT ORDERS PUTS AND END TO ANY PROSPECT OF SDLP PARTICIPATION IN TALKS THE FOLLOWING COMMENT IS PERHAPS NOT VERY IMPORTANT. 
BUT IN CASE THERE 
SHOULD BE FURTHER EXCHANGES WITH HIM IN HOSPITAL I MUST REPEAT THE VIEW STATED IN MY TEL NO 15 TO THE FCO THAT WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET TOO MUCH INVOLVED IN MANOEUVERINGS BETWEEN HIM AND THE OTHER SDLP MEMBERS: STILL LESS TO APPEAR TO BE TAKING INITIATIVES WHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS SETTING ONE MEMBER AGAINST ANOTHER.) FROM SOME OF THE THINGS FITT SAID TO EVANS I FEAR HE IS SADLY OUT OF TOUCH. 
HIS CONFIDENCE IN PADDY DEVLIN 
(WHO DISLIKES HIM) AND IVAN COOPER ( WHO PROBABLY DISLIKES EVERYBODY) IS NOT TO BE RELIED UPON. 
THE SUGGESTION 
THAT HUME IS LESS OPPOSED TO VIOLENCE THAN THE OTHERS IS VERY MUCH OPEN TO QUESTION. 
THE SENDING OF A PERSONAL MESSAGE 
TO CONWAY ASKING HIM TO BRING PRESSURE TO BEAR ON HUME TO ALIGN HIMSELF WITH FITT IS. LITTLE SHORT OF LUNATIC. SINCE I DO NOT RATE FITT’S DISCRETION ANY HIGHER THAN HIS JUDGMENT I THINK WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT GIVING ADVICE OF THE KIND REPORTED IN PARA 5 OF YOUR TEL UNDER REFERENCE. 
I DO NOT THINK THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS ON WHICH 
THE ADVICE WAS GIVEN WERE SOUND ONES,EG. THAT IT IS A LIKELY CASE THAT HUME WOULD BE ON ONE SIDE WITH ALL THE REST ON THE OTHER: AND SINCE IF WE ARE IN THE END GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS IN THIS COUNTRY WE SHALL NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK WITH THE SDLP I DO NOT THINK IT WOULD HELP FOR 
THEM TO DISCOVER THAT WE WERE ENGAGING EITHER HERE OR IN DUBLIN, IN THEIR INTERNAL PARTY RELATIONSHIPS.

15 September 1971 
today to let him know about a talk he had had in Northern Ireland with Mr. Ian Paisley and Mr. Boal. The meeting took place at a hotel near Antrim yesterday and lasted some two hours. 
Mr. Cecil King spoke to the Prime Minister 
The main theme which Mr. Boal and Mr. Paisley propounded was that, since Mr. Lynch was like 
to 
lose office, and since Mr. Faulkner had lost his influence while the Roman Catholic Church had lost all its political influence on Catholics in the North they felt that they cold come to an agreement with the Northern Catholics represented by the Opposition M.Ps at Stormont, and the corresponding Members at Westminster. They felt that if they were to open such negotiations, and thus risk their political future, and if the negotiations were successfully concluded, they would have the right to demand a general election in northern Ireland to put the agreement to the people and on the basis of this to form a government to carry out the agreed proposals. 
an honest man and "not a Fascist thing" as he was often depicted.

STATEMENT BY MR. FAULKNER 
Since 9th August persons have been detained under Orders made by me as Civil Authority under the Special Powers Act. 
I have now made Orders interning 219 of these persons. Other detainees have been released 
on the direction of the Atto rney-General, or their cases are still under consideration. In view of the widespread and proper concern over the use by the 
Government of internment powers, I think it is my duty to explain fully the considerations I have borne in mind in making Internment Orders. We are at present engaged in a deadly struggle against an armed 
conspiracy whose immediate purpose it is to destroy the peace, stability and security of this part of the United Kingdom. 
I say the immediate purpose. The ultimate purpose is the overthrow by violence the clear and 
democratically expressed wish of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. 
Neither the I.R.A., nor 
indeed any other organisation, will be allowed to achieve this by force of arms, though the present campaign of violence may have gained the support of some, who while professing to deplore the methods of the I.R.A., are in sympathy with its aims. The leaders of this campaign are using every technique available to 
bypass the ordinary processes of democracy and to over-ride the wishes of the great majority of law-abiding citizens. 
The Northern Ireland Government 
is fully committed to and has taken effective steps to implement the principle of securing for the minority here the fullest possible opportunity to participate in the running of affairs within the framework of democratic government. The danger of not taking firm measures to defeat the I.R.A. lies precisely in

PRIME MINISTER ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT You asked me to look into the possibilities for 
modifying the size and structure of the Ulster Defence Regiment, having regard to the pressures on Mr. Faulkner for more vigorous enforcement of law and order and for greater opportunities to participate in the protection of property against bomb attacks by terrorists. 
2. Taking first the question of the size of the regiment, 
since January this year we have been working to a ceiling of 6,000. However, despite vigorous attempts to attract recruits so as to reach this number, the present strength stands only at about 4,200. There is no reason to suppose that simply raising the ceiling would have the effect of increasing the flow of recruits, and it would be obvious both to Mr. Faulkner and to the public that a statement which said only that the ceiling was being raised would have no practical effect. It has therefore been necessary to consider whether there are any particular disincentives to recruitment that we might be able to remove. 
3. We should be under no illusions that the main reason 
why more people have not come forward to join the regiment (at least so far as the Protestants are concerned) is that it is not under the control of Stormont - coupled with the vetting procedures which exist to screen out would-be recruits who are known to have engaged in inter-communal thuggery in the past. Since we have no intention of divorcing the UDR from control by the Army, and hence by the British Government, that disincentive must and should remain. However, it is possible that there exists a limited number of right-minded people who would be more inclined to join the regiment if it provided more opportunity for service near home and for protecting local utilities and other such targets against attack. 
As at present constituted, the members of the UDR are theoretically liable to carry out their duties anywhere in the Province

Thank you for your letter of 26th August about the Prime Minister’s meeting with the Belfast Corporation. of declaring a state of emergency. 
I enclose a note about the possibility As you will see, the legislation is 
designed to enable the Government to maintain essential services (such as power and food supplies) if these are threatened by industrial or other action; it would not be appropriate or useful to invite it to deal with the threat to life and property posed by terrorist attacks. We have told Mr. Howard Smith that the Lord Mayor had commented that He will remedy this.

14th September 1971 ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT I attach a copy of a minute addressed to the 
Prime Minister which my Secretary of State was unable to sign this evening before leaving the office (for the dinner party which he is giving for the Canadian Minister of National Defence). As it deals with one of the main topics for discussion at the Prime Minister’s meeting tomorrow, I think you will prefer to have an unsigned copy now and the signed version later. 
I am sending copies of this letter and of the enclosure to Graham Angel and Brian Norbury.

SHOTGUNS FOR THE RUC 1. 
Following the incident when shots were fired at Coalisland 
RUC station last night, the Army has been asked to be ready to make available 209 shotguns, with ammunition, on loan, to the RUC from Army stocks. They would be for use solely in the defence. of police stations. 
2. This request is strongly supported by the GOC, the General 
Staff and MOD officials. It would help to relieve the actual and potential load on Army resources. It is consistent with the Hunt Report on the Police in Northern Ireland (paragraph 103: "...[firearms] should ordinarily be restricted to personnel on mobile or detective duties or the protection of police stations"). 
3. 4. CGS has agreed to the shotguns and ammunition being moved 
across to Northern Ireland this afternoon. They will not however be made available to the RUC without Ministerial authority. 
It is expected that a submission will be made this afternoon 
by the Police Authority in Northern Ireland to the Minister of Home Affairs, with a view to the RUC receiving the weapons this evening. It is possible that this submission will be blocked by Catholic members of the Police Authority; in which case the matter may have to be raised in the Joint Security Committee. 
5. The Home Secretary’s agreement will also be needed. Home 
Office officials are aware of the position. 6. 
Some of the shotguns will be Brownings with No 6 Shot (about 
250 pellets per cartridge). Above about 30 yards range, this is highly unlikely to be lethal; at 30 yards it could be lethal if shot hit the eyes; at very close range (5 yards) it would be quite lethal. The remainder will be Greeners, with S.G. shot (about. 12 pellets per cartridge) which is more likely to be lethal at all ranges up to 60 yards. 
7. this matter. You may wish to draw the Secretary of State’s attention to 14 September 1971

The Northern Ireland Prime Minister (Mr Brian Faulkner) this morning invited Mr John Taylor, Minister of State at the Ministry of Home Affairs, to discuss with him Mr Taylor’s speech at Fivemiletown last night. The policy of the Government of Northern Ireland on security manpower, as stated by the Prime Minister on a number of occasions, is as follows. 
1. There is a clear need to recruit and deploy substantial further numbers of men to strengthen border security, protect important installations and make the task of the terrorist much more difficult. 
2. This need is fully appreciated by the United Kingdom Government with which urgent measures to meet it are being discussed. 
3. It is the Government’s view that the existing reserve security forces 
- the Ulster Defence Regiment and RUC Reserve - can be strengthened and made more effective. 
4. The United Kingdom Government have made it clear that there can be no question cf raising any additional armed force for the security of Northern Ireland except with their agreement and consent. 
This decision has been 
accepted by the Northern Ireland Government on the understanding that the security needs of Northern Ireland ill be fully met. 
5. Any encouragement to form a force of any sort other than one lawfully constituted would do the greatest possible damage to the vital interests of Northern Ireland. 
Mr Taylor has made it clear to the Prime Minister that he is fully in support of this policy.

NOTE OF A MEETING AT THE HOME OFFICE ON MONDAY, 13TH SEPTEMBER 
Present: 
Home Secretary Mr. Waddell 
Mr. Woodfield Mr. Angel 
Mr. Hockaday (Ministry of Defence) Mr. K. White (Foreign Office) 
Mr. P. Gregson(Prime Minister’s Office) 
Tripartite Talks The Home Secretary said that public opinion would become impatient 
with demands from Mr. Lynch or Mr. Faulkner for pre-conditions for sitting down with the Prime Minister. 
The United Kingdom Government’s position 
should be that all three parties have well-known public positions which they have not abandoned by agreeing to participate in talks, but which should not prevent them from talking together. 
It was agreed that Sir Burke Trend 
should speak to Sir Harold Black to agree the revised date for the talks, 27th/28th September, and to urge in the Prime Minister’s name that in the meantime it would be best not to mako public statements about the basis on which the talks were to be held. Interment Mr. Woodfield reported that in his visit to Belfast on Friday, 10th 
September, he had found that the Internment Orders submitted for Mr. Faulkner’s signature contained only the briefest references to the grounds for internment and were not accompanied by supporting evidence. 
Each Order gave the reason 
for internment, which ranged from stating that the person concerned was a known members of the I.R.A., to stating that he was believed to be a member of the I.R.A. 
Mr. Woodfield had told Mr. Faulkner that there should be grounds 
on the face of each Order which Mr. Faulkner signed to justify internment. It was not sufficient that there might be evidence elsewhere. 
It was also

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND MR. FAULKNER ON SATURDAY 11 SEPTEMBER AT 6:00 P.M. 
P.M. I’m sorry to worry you wherever you are. 
Mr. F. That’s all right. I’m in a call-box I’m afraid. P.M. We have been trying to get you this afternoon because things 
have moved fairly fast, I got a message when I got up here at Blamoral, I’ve been travelling up from Edinburgh this morning, that the gentleman was accepting the invitation and a message also that he for his part would like the announcement to be put out tonight and so we drew up our announcement and that’s what we’ve been trying to get you to read it over to you. 
It’s in the form in which I said we would do it. Since then we’ve had the message that he has 
made a statement and the statement says that he has decided to accept the invitation to come to the meeting. And so this has meant that we ourselves have had to put out the statement in this formal way. I’ll just read over to you what it says: "The Taoiseach has accepted an invitation from the Prime Minister to meet him and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland for discussions on matters of common interest. 
The precise date for the meeting is still to be arranged, 
but it is expected that the meeting will not be long delayed." Now we understand that his position is that he can do the dates which we propose, but apparently he’s got some obligations which he’s got to get out of to do it, and he hasn’t yet been able to tell the people that he would cancel whatever he was going to do, he didn’t want the precise dates stated in this particular announcement. 
We 
shall give guidance about it, but I think that just enables him to go through the formality of cancelling his present obligations. Mr. F. What has he said in his statement? P.M. 
Oh well, he’s made a long statement - we’ve got it here - 
covers about a page and a half. Mr. F. Oh, I see. I gathered from my office that he’d said in hi statement that he was meeting me as the leader of majority opini or something here, in other words not as Prime Minister.

10th September, 1971 You mentioned to me earlier this morning that Mr. Faulkner 
had been in touch with the Prime Minister by telephone, to express dissatisfaction at the way in which his discussion with the Chief of General Staff had gone yesterday afternoon, and to express concern about CGS’s intention to issue a statement before his departure from Belfast at lunchtime today. I explained that the original intention had been for General Carver to issue a statement in the form at Annex A to this letter, which had been approved earlier in the week by the Minister of State for Defence; but that CGS had since sent a signal, late last night, proposing the addition of an extra paragraph to the statement, and also mentioning that Mr. Faulkner was pressing for a revised version of this extra paragraph. A copy of CGS’s signal is attached at Annex B. 
As you will see, CGS did not feel able to accept the 
revision unless it were first confirmed that Mr. Faulkner was correct in his claim (at paragraph 1 of the signal) as to what he had agreed in conversation with the Prime Minister on 7th September - a claim which seemed to be at odds with the record of that conversation contained in Armstrong’s letter of 8th September to Angel. However, when I put this point to you, your feeling was that the Prime Minister would be entirely opposed to any statement at all being made by CGS at this juncture, while so many important issues are in the balance. I reported this view by telephone to the Defence Secretary (who, as you know, is at his home in Buckinghamshire today) and Lord Carrington was fully in agreement that it would be preferable for no statement to be made. I accordingly passed a message through Headquarters Northern Ireland to General Carver that no statement should be made.

10 September, 1971 I am sorry not to have replied earlier to Peter Moon’s 
letter of 27 August about possible comparison between the situations in Northern Ireland and Pakistan. 
The purpose of our telegram No. 175 to Dublin was to 
ensure that the Ambassador and our Mission in New York kept a close eye on the possibility of the Irish raising the question of Northern Ireland in the U.N. and to set out some of the political factors that would arise for us there. Our conclusion in paragraph 2 of the telegram that recent events in Northern Ireland "tend, in U N. terms, to put the situation on all fours with the situation between India and Pakistan" was certainly not meant to imply that we accepted that the comparison was valid. It is, however, unavoidable that unfriendly delegations in New York will seek to draw comparisons between events in East Pakistan and Northern Ireland, and we must be prepared for this. For example in speaking of events in East Pakistan our delegation will have to bear in mind the danger of our words being used against us in the context of Northern Ireland. 
Outside Pakistan there has so far been little press 
comment making a comparison between the situation in Northern Ireland and that in East Pakistan. We keep watch for this, and for the need to keep our posts abroad fully briefed. The press in Pakistan, on the other hand, has been making the most of similarities it can draw between the two situations; it consistently carries a lot of copy on Northern Ireland, emphasising the violence which, it is alleged, is exercised by the troops, and the suffering experienced at their hands. Our High Commission in Islamabad take steps as appropriate to put these reports in proper perspective, and there are indications that responsible Pakistan opinion is embarrassed by this obvious attempt to divert attention from Pakistan’s own troubles.

7 September, 1971 Northern Ireland Reform Programme Would you please refer to your letter of 26 August, 
in which you passed on the Prime Minister’s view that a copy of the Northern Ireland Government’s White Paper should he passed to the Pope by our Legation to the Holy See. 
I am sure they will have passed a copy to the Vatican. 
They have been assiduous in using the guidance they have received. But we shall certainly make quite sure that a copy goes in at a high level with the request that it be drawn to the Pope’s attention.

Dear Pud, Thank you for your letter of 27 August. 
Your point about the need to make fuller use of the Governor’s talents has not been absent from my thoughts, and I had a word with Brian Faulkner about it when he was here in August. There are, of course, obvious limitations arising from the Governor’s constitutional position. As you will appreciate, his role is not the same as that of a Governor in a dependent territory. But your point is being kept in mind. On your point about the B.B.C., you probably 
saw the line taken by Peter Carrington, which received considerable publicity. 
Yours, Ted. 
His Grace The Duke of Westminster T.D., D.., J.P.

DRAFT STATEMENT (Alternative Version) 8 p.m. 6 September 1971 
The British Government remain determined 
that violence in Northern Ireland to an end and that conditions in which all the citizens of 
Northern Ireland may live in peace, regardless of differences of religous or political profession. For this purpose they have considered with the Government 
of Northern Ireland what further action can be taken to this end; and, recognising the legitimate interest of the Government of the Republic, the Prime Minister has explained United Kingdom policy to the Taoiseach and has discussed w ith him what contribution the Government of the Republic might make to its realisation. The United Kingdom Government have been encouraged 
to find complete unanimity between all parties both on the importance of eradicating violence as an instrument of political pressure and on the need to ensure a more effective participation by the minority in Northern Ireland in the government and administration of the Six Counties. The United Kingdom Government believe that this basic 
their origin; and it is without prejudice to those differences tat they have agreed, in discussion with 
unity of purpose should not be frustrated by differences about the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, wether they are historical, religious or political in

NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 27 AUGUST-2 SEPTEMBER 1971 
Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL SITUATION 1. 
Belfast continues and many other areas in Northern Ireland have suffered from this form of attack during the period. 
The large number and heavy weight of explosions occurring in There have 
also been many incidents of shooting at members of the security forces and while most have failed to find their target, two soldiers and one member of the UDR have died from gunshots. 
There continues 
to be comparatively little street activity in Northern Ireland and there have been no reports of trouble arising from meetings to protest at internment and to support civil disobedience. 
These 
meetings have not always been well attended, particularly in Belfast. Mr Heath’s meeting with Mr Lynch on 6 and 7 September has been generally welcomed but there is no sign that the parliamentary opposition is preparing to take a less intransigent position. 
There 
are signs that Protestant criticism of the security situation is growing. 
SECURITY SITUATION 2. 
The situation in Belfast has encompassed explosions, armed robberies, shooting incidents and isolated street disorder. 
Targets 
for bomb attacks included a customs house, shops, commercial offices, electricity equipment, a church hall, a club and a petrol station. In recent months this type of property has become a regular target. More unusually, explosions on 2 September occurred in Belfast’s city centre injuring about 54 people. condemnation from Mr Lynch. 
This incident drew a strong He expressed sympathy to the families 
of those who had died in such incidents and to those who were injured. One of the explosions occurred at the Unionist Party’s headquarters where a bomb failed to explode on 19 August (see HONIP(71) 33 page 1). About £2,500 was stolen in four armed robberies in Belfast on 27 August and a further £200 was stolen on 28 August. 
The first 
shooting incident in Belfast of the period occurred on 29 August when a soldier, Gunner Loring, was shot while at an Army checkpoint. died on 31 August.

and done my best to make it as convincing as possible. I am left with a feeling of dismay about the bareness of the landscape and the absence of any realistic prospect of making progress on the basis of our present assumptions. I find this dismay increasingly shared by others in Whitehall; and although one hesitates to embark too lightheartedly on a fundamental change of policy, I have jotted down in the attached note one possible new approach to the problem. 
At this stage it is not much more than Lord President and Lord Rothschild. 
thinking aloud’’; and I have not discussed it with anybody except the I do not suggest that Monday’s 
meeting with Mr. Lynch will provide the occasion to explore this approach with him! But I have an uncomfortable feeling that sooner or later - and perhaps sooner rather than later - we shall be driven to call in question some of the political and constitutional assumptions which we have hitherto accepted.

PRIME MINISTER There seem to be only two possible approaches to the problem of 
Northern Ireland: (1) We can go on as we are. (2) We can try to devise some new political initiative. 
2. The brief for the meeting with Mr. Lynch is based, fundamentally, on 
the former assumption, i. e. that we go on as we are, doing the best we can within the limits of certain political and constitutional assumptions which are regarded as beyond question. If we are honest with ourselves, however, we must admit that this means, essentially, that we go on Living from day to day and from hand to mouth, arguing first with the North and then with the South about each successive "incident", adjusting our tactics to developments in the situation as they occur, hoping that sooner or later things will get better but always waiting on events and the reaction which they dictate. The advantage of this course is that - so far at least 
from finally boiling over; and it may, of course, continue to do so. 
- it has succeeded in preventing the pot If so, 
we might be well-advised to stick to this policy. Its disadvantage, however, ii that it offers no permanent solution, no light at the distant end of the tunnel and, it must be admitted, no current prospect of success in the short term. On the contrary, the situation seems to be steadily deteriorating; the relations between Ulster and Eire appear to be becoming increasingly polarised; the IRA are adopting a daily more flagrant attitude of defiance towards all three Governments involved; civil disobedience in Ulster. encouraged by Dublin, is approaching the point when really serious social and economic damage could be inflicted on the Province (at the ultimate expense of the British taxpayer); and the Opposition at Westminster are beginning to try to snatch the political initiative from the Government’s hands. If this process continues, sooner or later the elastic must snap; and one of the main objections to merely "going on as we are" is that this course offers no insurance that the breaking point will not come sooner rather than later. Another objection is that disobedience and violence are apt to be infectious; and Great Britain is uncomfortably close to Northern Ireland from this point of view. 3. 
The alternative policy - i.e. a radical new political initiative - would 
be designed to anticipate the point at which the elastic snaps and to ensure that we received the credit for having tried to avert calamity while there wa still time to do so. The form of such an initiative could not be decided,

BRITISH POLICY IN NORTHERN IRELAND (Note by the Central Policy Review Staff) 
In 1969 and 1970 successive British Governments had a well-defined policy on Northern Ireland. Its prospects of success were promising; its assumptions were reasonable; it commanded bipartisan respect at Westminster; and it was supported by the moderate men at the head of the Governments in Belfast and Dublin. Through no fault of our own, that policy has failed. It is important to be absolutely clear about what we were trying to achieve; about the completeness of our failure; and about our need for a new policy if we are not simply to flounder. 
2. The 1969-70 policy arose from the Stormont Government’s failure 
to maintain order with its own resources. It had to call in the British Army. The Westminster Government demanded a major concession in return. That concession was the Reform Programme, designed to remove the basis for Catholic grievances. It was recognised that this Programme would be unpopular with the Protestant majority which had elected the Unionist Government at Stormont. But in 1969 the next Stormont elections were still four years away. In the interval it was hoped that there would be time for the Programme to take effect; for the Catholic community to be reconciled to Unionist rule; and for the Protestant community to discover that Reform could bring peace without endangering their way of life. It would then be possible for the moderate Unionists, lead by e.g. Chichester Clark or Faulkner, to win the 1973 elections and to defeat any extremist Protestant challenge led by e.g. Craig or Paisley. 
3. One element in this policy has worked out well. Contrary to see

30th September, 1971 UDR EXPANSION I have just received a message from the Defence Secretary, 
who is visiting Northern Ireland. Subject to the outcome of his meeting with Northern Ireland Ministers tomorrow, Lord Carrington wishes to announce just before his departure tomorrow afternoon that we are not merely dispensing with the previous ceiling of 6,000 men for the UDR but are working to an "immediate target of 10,000". 
General Tuzo’s advice is that a statement in these 
positive terms will be significantly more satisfactory to Stormont than a more "negative" statement about removing the 6,000 ceiling and that it is also more likely to persuade volunteers actually to come forward. The implications of reaching a target of 10,000 have been taken into account and although the problems would be substantial they are not considered insuperable. 
The Defence Secretary would be grateful to know, by 
9 a.m. tomorrow morning if possible, that the Prime Minister and Home Secretary see no objection to a statement on these lines. I am copying this letter to Graham Angel and should be grateful if you could let me have clearance or comments as quickly as possible.

30th September, 1971. I regret that as a result of an error here we still 
owe you a reply to your letter of 19 August in which you reported the Prime Minister’s comment on Dublin telegram no 322. 
As you know, examples of the inability of Courts in 
the Republic to convict members of the IRA were given in Annex D to the brief prepared for the Prime Minister’s use at his meeting with Mr Lynch on 6 and 7 September. That meeting, and the subsequent tripartite meeting on 27 and 28 September, however, obviously made it inappropriate for us to become involved in an overt publicity campaign against the manifest failings of the administration of justice in the Republic. 
Nevertheless we took steps to 
point examples out to journalists on an unattributable basis. 
While too early to form a final judgment, it could 
be that the two series of talks this month will result in some willingness on the part of the Irish to co-operate discreetly with us against the IRA, without having first to be publicly reminded of their inadequacies. 
That 
being so, we propose to continue at the same level of activity. 
If, however, Mr Lynch’s government reverted 
to its more belligerent attitude of last August we should review the situation. 
I am sending copies of this letter to Graham Angel (Home Office) and Robert Andrew (MOD).

TRIPARTITE TALKS ON NORTHERN IRELAND Chequers, 27 and 28 September 1971 
AGREED STATEMENT During the last two days we have discussed the situation in 
Northern Ireland in all its aspects. We have done so fully recog- 
nising that each of us remains committed to his publicly stated position on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland; and we have been concerned to see whether, without prejudice to those positions, we can find some agreed means of enabling all the people of Northern Ireland to live in the conditions of peace and stability which any democracy should ensure to its citizens without regard to their religious or political conviction. 
We are at one in condemning any form of violence as an instrument 
of political pressure; and it is our common purpose to seek to bring violence, and internment and all other emergency measures to an end without delay. 
We also recognise that to bring violence quickly to an end and to 
resume economic, social and cultural progress means must be found to establish harmony and co-operation between the two communities in Northern Ireland. 
Our discussions in the last two days have helped to 
create an atmosphere of greater understanding between us and it is our hope that the process of political reconciliation may go forward to a successful outcome. 
We agree that our meeting has served a significant and useful 
purpose in present circumstances, and we believe that further such meetings may have a helpful part to play in the future. 
Mr. Heath and Mr. Lynch agreed to keep in close communication with 
each other, personally, through their ministerial colleagues and at official level, as might be appropriate, on all subjects affecting the future of Anglo-Irish relations. 
In this respect the meeting between 
the two Prime Ministers scheduled for the autumn to discuss a range of subjects, including the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the applications of both countries for membership of the European Communities will be held on dates to be announced later.

D/Min/RB/5 Pt 9 September, 1971 You wrote to Robert Andrew on 26th August asking whether 
more effective action could be taken by the security forces to deal with explosions. We delayed a reply because Lord Balniel intended to speak to the Prime Minister on 5th September about this, but in the event the topic was not raised. However, since then I understand that the CGS has explained the position to the Prime Minister. You have asked for a reply to keep on the record. 
Robert Andrew’s letter to you of 18th May set out various 
measures being taken to counter the use of explosives. Amongst these was the intention to set up explosive detection teams to attempt to trace the sources of the explosives used. These have been fully operational since June. 
We have discussed with Northern Ireland whether any further 
measures can be taken. The Army is stepping up its surveillance of vulnerable points with the specific object of trying to catch those responsible for placing bombs or explosives, even if the resulting explosions cannot be prevented. But of course the key to prevention is in good intelligence of the whereabouts of the terrorists’ illegal stocks of explosives and their intended targets; and in proper controls over distribution of legally held explosives. 
RUC Special Branch intelligence sources reduced considerably 
immediately after Internment was announced on 9th August, but have since improved again, and we hope we shall eventually get a lead to the prime sources of the explosives 
- and the bombers 
by interrogation. We are also working on the feasibility of arranging for all 
detonators manufactured in the UK in future to be marked indelibly with a concealed coding which would enable the source of any found in unexploded bombs to be traced. However, there 
are a number of difficulties in the way of a practicable scheme, and it would inevitably take some time before marked detonators began to find their way into the hands of the terrorists. There have been references to the possibility of this kind of approach in the press; but we are keen not to show our hands publicly before we are ready,both because of the practical difficulties and because of the risk that terrorists would be put on their guard and would lay in a stock of unmarked 
- detonators.

Ref. A0469 PRIME MINISTER 
Northern Ireland: Chequers Meeting I attach a copy of the brief for the tripartite meeting. Although it 
contains nothing very novel, I think that, given the intractable nature of the problem. it is about as comprehensive as we can make it. But it may be worth adding a few thoughts about the way In which the discussion itself might be conducted. 
I have run over the ground with Sir Harold Black 
again this morning: and the following suggestions reflect what I have said to him. But I made it clear that they could not commit you, since you might prefer to conduct the meeting on a different basis. In either case it will be very helpful that you will have an opportunity for rehearsal with each of the parties separately before the tripartite discussion. 
1. Start by trying to get agreement on the purpose of the meeting. It 
is not to go over yet again the old arguments and grievances on both sides. It is not even to discuss possible reforms in any more detail than anybody wishes or finds convenient. 
It is, quite simply, to try to change the whole 
climate and atmosphere in which the problem is being dealt with; and to show that, despite the current disorder and bloodshed, it is still possible for three men, all of whom have a direct interest and concern in what happens in Northern Ireland, to meet and to discuss the problem coolly and rationally. So long as this remains possible, there is no need for ultimate despair. 
if it ceased to be possible, we should be moving into a very ugly situation indeed. 
won’t agree, are you prepared to face the alternative II. 
(The first hint of the ultimate question. "If either or both of you Next, agree that on the basic issue of partition. the Border and the 
constitutional status of the Six Counties, the position of the three Governments is well known and does not need to be restated. The meeting is explicitly without prejudice to those declared positions. Otherwise, all bets are off and the discussion can be conducted as freely and with as little inhibition as the participants wish. They will not be committed to anything beyond what they may agree to say jointly at the end. 
But,

HOME SECRETARY Northern Ireland: Direct Rule We cannot tell how things will go after next week’s 
tripartite meeting at Chequers. But on one hypothesis we might find ourselves compelled to move to direct rule fairly soon thereafter. I should like to be sure that, if so, our plans are as ready as they can be in terms of the legislation, the appointment of key personnel, the provision of secure communications, the intensification of security and intelligence measures, and so forth. I believe also that we have hitherto based our planning on an assumption that in circumstances of direct rule we could continue to rely cn the loyalty of the RUC and the public service in Northern Ireland. But suppose that that assumption proved to be invalid. Have we alternative 
plans ready? I should be grateful if you would look into this 
matter personally and let me know whether anything further remains to be done.

PRIME MINISTER I discussed with Sir Burke Trend this morning 
possible arrangements for putting the Northern Ireland machinery on a "war" footing. 
There are three 
ingredients in this: situation reporting, situation appraisal and deliberation for action. Sir Burke Trend’s note attached outlines a machinery 
which you could, after discussion with the Home Secretary and if the Home Secretary was content, put to Mr. Faulkner. The big question is in the first sentence of 
Sir Burke Trend’s minute. Both he and I think that it 
would be very unwise for you to take charge of Northern Ireland directly. 
ought to engage your attention. 
There are plenty of other things which There is always a risk 
that something will blow up on Northern Ireland when you ought to be concentrating on something else. 
There is also 
the political risk of taking over sole responsibility. Sir Burke Trend and I also both believe that neither 
the existing machinery nor what is proposed will really work with full effect so long as the responsibility for Northern Ireland remains in the Home Office. 
For the 
time being, we need a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. If this is thought to be out of the question for 
domestic political reasons, or because of the risk of rousing fears in Northern Ireland that direct rule is imminent, a second-best would be to have an effective Minister for Northern Ireland in the Home Office

September 1971 One of the points which Mr. Faulkner might raise with the 
Prime Minister at Chequers is the protection of police stations. A few police stations are protected by the army or the 
U.D.R. In the light of recent attacks on police stations the Northern Ireland Government want every police station to have armed protection. Ministry of Defence are not prepared to authorize the use of the Army for this purpose except where the G.O.C. considers there are special circumstances nor are they prepared to authorize the extensive use of the U.D.R. 
The Police Authority and the Chief Constable have prepared 
a scheme which involves recruiting a branch of the RUC Reserve to guard all police stations with automatic weapons on a fulltime basis. We received this report on 21st September with a request that Her Majesty’s Government’s decision on it should be given by 22nd September. There was also a variant on the scheme proposed by the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland that the regular R.U.C. should be issued with Sterlings to guard all police stations. 
Either plan needs to be studied both to see whether it is 
professionally sound; Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary is doing this; and also to assess the political significance of the scheme in the light of the Hunt Report’s expressed recognition that firearms can be issued to police personnel whose duty it is to protect police stations and the recent ministerial statements rejecting any possibility of a third force. 
The Northern Ireland Government have been told that they 
will be sent a considered reply as soon as the Home Secretary has formed a view in the light of professional advice. 
I am copying this letter to Stephens (Defence). P. L. Gregson, Esq.

this evening about the proposed visit to Long Kesh by the International Red Cross. 
You told me that the Prime Minister might like to say something We suggest that this might be along the lines that the 
Northern Ireland Government have said that they would welcome a visit to places of internment by the International Red Cross; that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has conveyed this invitation to Geneva; and that a team from the International Red Cross is expected to visit Northern Ireland in the near future. at about the end of the month. 
We think this is likely to be On the question of publication of the 
report of the visit, we understand that this would normally be published subject to the agreement of the country concerned. 
I understand that 
in this case, Stormont rather than Westminster would be the appropriate authority. 
You may like to know for your own information that representatives 
of the British Red Cross will be seeing officials at the Home Office tomorrow for an informal meeting aimed at providing us with information in preparation for the later visit by the International team. 
On another point, we have ascertained from Northern Ireland that 
the salary of the Parliamentary Commissioner is paid out of their Consolidated Fund. 
I understand that he did not receive anything from 
that source until 1st April 1971 (i.e. until after he had ceased to hold the office of Parliamentary Commissioner for the United Kingdom as a whole).

23rd September 1971 I am writing to record my conversation with 
Cummings in Mr. Faulkner’s office this morning about the request of a number of M.Ps. to visit the places of internment in Northern Ireland. 
Cummings told me that this had been discussed 
in the Joint Security Committee this morning in the context of the Northern Ireland Government’s invitation to the International Red Cross to visit places of internment, and bearing in mind their refusal so far to allow their own Members of Parliament to make a general inspection of places of internment as opposed to visiting individual constituents. Cummings said that they would very much prefer to receive one representative Parliamentary delegation rather than a series of groups of M.PS. 
He 
authorised us to say on behalf of the Ministry of Home Affairs in Northern Ireland that any request from Westminster M.Ps "would receive sympathetic consideration".

23rd September 1971 The Secretary of the Northern Ireland Detainees Enquiry telephoned 
this morning to say that Sir Edmund Compton was disturbed to hear of Mr. Thorpe’s reference to him during the debate yesterday as an employee of the Northern Ireland Government (Col. 53 of the Official Report). 
Sir 
Edmund has asked if a Government spokesman taking part in the debate today could use the following form of words to rebut this damaging statement:- 
"The chairman is not in the employment of either the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland Governments. 
His status as 
Parliamentary Commissioner is similar to that of a judge. The law governing his appointment ensures he is fully independent of Government with full powers to investigate, and if need be, criticise the actions of Government". 
I told the Secretary that I could by no means guarantee that this 
form of words would be used, but I would bring them to the attention of the Prime Minister. 
We have discovered a little detail about the three internees ment- 
ioned in the "Sunday Times" article quoted by the Leader of the Opposition in yesterday’s debate. 
I attach a note which reveals very little about 
the reasons for the three men being interned but does set at rest any anxiety about their physical condition. 
I attach a note about conditions at Long Kesh which I understand you 
have also asked for. Mr. Sydney Bidwell, M.P., Mr. William Molloy, M.P. and Mr. Arthur 
Latham, M.P. have asked the Home Secretary if it would be possible for them to visit Long Kesh on behalf of the "Labour Committee Against Internment in Northern Ireland". 
a number of other unspecified M.Ps. could also visit Long Kesh. know the results of my enquiries. Mr. Kevin McNamara has asked if he and Responsi- 
bility for this matter rests with the Ministry of Home Affairs, Northern Ireland. 
I will be in touch with them during the day and will let you J. G. PILLING Peter Gregson, Esq.

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland: Machinery If the responsibility for Northern Ireland is to remain in the Home 
Office but the machinery of administration is to be tightened up, the best way of proceeding might be:(a) To centralise the supply of basic information in order to ensure that 
all those concerned with the problem are informed of the same facts at the same time.

(It is disconcerting how difficult it is at present to find out what This would mean creating a new 
unit, which would bring together, on the basis of a daily meeting, officials of the Home Office, the FCO, the Ministry of Defence and the intelligence staffs. The Home Office might feel that they should take the chair. 
But 
it might be better if the unit were located in the Cabinet Office, with a Cabinet Office chairman; and, if this post were filled by Mr. Cairncross, the Home Office might be the more easily reconciled to the arrangement. 
But the unit would necessarily continue to depend on the Home Office and the Ministry of at 
Defence for communications. (b) To require this unit to produce:(i) A regular (? every 48 hours) situation report on political and security developments in the Province, for the information of United Kingdom Ministers. 
(ii) A sanitised version of these reports, perhaps once a week, on a basis suitable for submission to Northern Ireland Ministers as well as to our own. 
(c) To require this unit to equip itself, in addition, to become the 
nucleus of the executive agency which we should need in Whitehall if we moved to direct rule. (d) To arrange for it to circulate its 48-hourly reports to an appropriate body of Ministers and officials. 
The membership, as regards Ministers, 
might be the same as the existing Northern Ireland Committee, possibly modified by excluding the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who has a good many other things on his plate at the moment) and including the Lord President. The membership would then consist of yourself, the Home Secretary, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Secretary of State for Defence and the Lord President, together with officials (Civil and military) as appropriate.

During the last [two] days we have discussed 
the situation in Northern Ireland. We have done so in the full realisation that the grave problems involved which are the cause of such anxiety and distress to the Governments and peoples of all three countries, cannot be completely analysed in isolation or in relation only to the Six Counties but mast be seen in the wider context of the dispute about the partition of Ireland as a whole. 
far back in history. But over the years it has compelled the three Governments to adopt certain positions on the validity of the Border and the constitutional status of Northern Ireland which are well known and do not need to be restated in detail. Each Government remains publicly committed to its respective position on those issues. 
But. because developments in Northern 
Ireland raise issues of such critical urgency for all car Governments, we have conducted our discussions with no other preconditions. On this basis we have reviewed the situation 
frankly and without reserve. As a result each of us understands more fully the difficulties which confront the others and the considerations which necessarily limit their freedom of action. 
But, without 
minimising these difficulties or the inevitable differences between our Governments, we have nevertheless been concerned to consider whether there is any action which we can agree to take in order to put an end to the violence and disorder which are subjecting our three countries, and Northern Ireland in particular , 
to increasingly severe stress in both human and material terms. The origins of that dispute lie

We had a word yesterday evening about the briefings 
which seem to have been given recently both to the Press and to visitors to Northern Ireland. 
discussed this with Donald Maitland. I have It seems that 
there may not be a general problem but rather two separate and fairly narrow problems:(i) The unethical behaviour of the "Insight" team of the Sunday Times. 
(ii) A rather too articulate and forthcoming attitude to visitors by General Tuzo. 
Donald is dealing with (i) by warning Departments 
against having any dealings with the "Insight" team. He does however think that briefings by officials such as Philip Woodfield of the Press (particularly of the Foreign Press) is beneficial and should be encouraged. On (ii), the best course would probably be for 
you to have a word at some convenient moment with Lord Carrington; he can deal with the matter very easily when he goes to Northern Ireland at the end of next week.

20th September 1971 During the Prime Minister’s meeting at Chequers on 
15th September to deal with various points concerning Northern Ireland, there was some discussion on the question of harnessing the desire of members of the TAVR in Northern Ireland to do their bit in aid of the security forces. Two possible courses - to call out the TAVR as such, or to find some way of switching complete TAVR units to the UDR-were considered but rejected. The Prime Minister expressed interest, however, in trying to arrive at some arrangement whereby individual members of the TAVR might resign so as to serve in the UDR, with reserved rights to rejoin the TAVR in due course, and the Defence Secretary and CGS undertook to look into this possibility further. 
The Defence Secretary has now approved an outline scheme 
as set out in the attached "prospectus" which has been prepared in a form suitable for issue through TAVR units in Northern Ireland. This scheme sets out to remove as far as possible the disincentives to transfer 
- we believe reasonably 
successfully. There are just two points about it which call for some comment. First, we had hoped that it would be possible to give a full guarantee that any rank held in the TAVR would be automatically restored if the holder, having switched to the UDR, subsequently re-enlisted in the TAVR; but there would be serious practical difficulties in giving such an assurance in absolute terms, and we do not feel able to go beyond the formula in paragraph 8 of the attached prospectus. Second, the requirement to undergo the same vetting process as any other applicant for the UDR (paragraph 
3 of the prospectus) may rankle with some ex-TAVR applicants, but we feel we must stick to it - since a man whose political views might not necessarily conflict with his value as a TAVR member might of course be quite unacceptable for the UDR.

Cabinet: Northern Ireland I am not sure how much discussion about Northern Ireland you will 
wish to have at Cabinet tomorrow. But you may like to take the opportunity, before the Parliamentary debate and your meeting with Mr. Lynch and Mr. Faulkner, to give your colleagues a brief summary of the present position, to seek their approval in general terms to our objectives at the tripartite meeting and to make sure that they appreciate the possible consequences if that meeting yields no real improvement in the situation. 2. 
of State for Defence might be asked to summarise, briefly, how matters stand on the political and security fronts respectively. 
There is not much 
ground for optimism in either respect. There will be even less if the Parliamentary debate develops unsatisfactorily; and it is important that the line taken by the Government and their supporters should be as conciliatory as possible, without sacrificing any of the points of principle which we should have to maintain, perhaps even more firmly, if we were compelled to institute direct rule. 3. 
As regards the current position the Home Secretary and the Secretary As regards our objectives at the tripartite meeting, these can perhaps 
be summarised as follows:(a) We must seek to prepare the way for the Home Secretary’s conference - not by attempting to rehearse in detail the various proposals which may be canvassed at that conference but by trying to create the conditions in which all parties will be prepared to discuss any means of improving the position of the minority without preconditions other than the necessary reservation as regards the Border and the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. 
(The Cabinet should be clear that the 
constitutional status of Northern Ireland can, and should, be distinguished from the constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland. Provided that Ulster remains an integral part of the United Kingdom, our pledge is satisfied; and there is nothing in that pledge to prevent us considering radical changes at Stormont itself - 
e. g. changes in the size and composition 
of both Houses, the introduction of proportional representation, and even a coalition Government, if it were created by democratic means. The Cabinet

Northern Ireland I am sending you separately a brief for tomorrow’s Cabinet, since I 
think that it might be wise for you to make sure that you have your colleagues’ support as regards both our line at the forthcoming tripartite meeting and the disagreeable and dangerous course on which we may have to embark thereafter 
- possibly at very short notice - if the meeting is wholly 
unproductive. I do not suggest that you should seek to do any more at Cabinet 
tomorrow. But there are two additional points which I ought to bring to your attention:(a) The concept of a deal between Paisley and the Roman Catholics 
is clearly gaining ground. Hugh Fraser came to see me this morning, at his own request,to give me his impressions after a visit to Northern Ireland during which he clearly saw a good many people. Put pretty briefly, the main points which he wants to make (and would welcome an opportunity to discuss with you personally) are as follows:(i) The Army are getting into an increasingly untenable position. The hostility of the Catholics is now so great that there are not merely Catholic "no go" areas and Protestant "no go" areas; there are also Army "no go" areas, in which the Army are compelled to remain more or less permanently on the defensive in their own enclaves, with occasional sallies to deal with some local disturbance. (This situation was described very vividly in the attached article from the Financial Times which you may have seen). Moreover, relations between the Army and the RUC are now very bad; and the RUC have practically withdrawn from the business of maintaining law and order in the worst areas. General Tuzo has been compelled to fall back on the expedient of sending troops out in police cars; but this is a very ambiguous development in the role of the troops,which we ought not to countenance. 
(ii) Authority is now disintegrating rapidly at all levels; and Mr. Faulkner’s writ no longer really runs in a large part of the Province. On the other hand there is no reason why Mr. Faulkner should not survive politically for an indefinite time. There is no obvious means by which he can legitimately be overthrown.

PRIME MINISTER FROM PETER GREGSON 
I UNDERSTAND THAT MR FAULKNER SPOKE TO THE HOME SECRETARY THIS AFTERNOON AND SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO PUBLISH BEFORE THE DEBATE HIS GREEN PAPER SETTING OUT HIS PROPOSALS FOR THE REFORM OF STORMONT. 
OF COMMONS AND POSSIBLY ALSO PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION.) ARGUMENTS WERE: 
(1) THAT AT A TIME WHEN PROPOSALS WERE BEING MADE FROM ALL IT WAS WRONG THAT THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT SHOULD APPEAR NOT TO HAVE ANY PROPOSALS TO MAKE FOR GREATER PARTICIPATION BY THE MINORITY. 
(2) THIS WOULD HELP TO PRODUCE A FAVOURABLE CLIMATE FOR 
THE DEBATE. (3) 
THAT THE PROPOSALS IN THE GREEN PAPER WOULD STAND A 
MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF SUCCESS IF TREY WERE TO PRECEDE THE TRI PARTITE TALKS AND THUS BE SEEN AS FLOWING FROM THE INITIATIVE OF STORMONT RATHER THAN AS A RESPONSE TO PRESSURE BY LYNCH. 
WERE SOME SERIOUS OBJECTIONS TO THIS PROPOSAL. 
THE HOME SECRETARY TOLD MR FAULKNER THAT HE THOUGHT THERE HE THOUGHT THAT 
THERE WAS MUCH MERIT IN THE PROPOSALS BUT THAT IF THEY WERE UNVEILED AT THIS STAGE IT WAS LIKELY THAT THEY WOULD BE wRITTEN OFF AND TALKED DOwN IN THE DEBATE SO THAT THEY WOLD BE DEVALUED BY THE TIME THE TRI-PARTITE TALKS TOOK PLACE. 
THE CHANCE OF THEIR BEING 
ACCEPTED BY THE MINORITY AS A SIGNIFICANT CONCESSION WOULD BE WEAKENED. 
MOREOVER, HE THOUGHT THAT A PROPOSAL 
MADE BY STORMONT TENDED TO CARRY WITH IT, FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE MINORITY, A BUILT IN HANDICAP. 
THE HOME SECRETARY LEFT IT WITH MR FAULKNER THAT HE WOULD 
REFLECT ON THE MATTER OVER THE WEEKEND AND THAT THEY WOULD TALK AGAIN ON MONDAY. 
I HAVE HAD A WORD WITH SIR BURKE TREND. HE STILL TAKES THE 
VIEW WHICH HE EXPRESSED TO YOU YESTERDAY, AND WHICH I ALSO HOLD, THAT TO PUT FORWARD THESE PROPOSALS NOW WOULD BE SIMPLY TO WASTE AMMUNITION IN ADVANCE OF THE TRI-PARTITE TALKS. ADMITTEDLY IT WOULD GIVE GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN SOMETHING MORE POSITIVE TO SAY IN THE DEBATE, BUT THIS IS A SMALL BENEFIT COMPARED WITH THE POSSIBLE COST TO OUR POSITION IN THE TALKS. 
I WANTED TO WARN YOU OF ALL THIS IN CASE IT IS RAISED WITH YOU OVER THE WEEKEND EITHER BY MR FAULKNER OR BY THE HOME SECRETARY. THE PROPOSALS MIGHT STAND A 
BETTER CHANCE OF ACCEPTANCE BY THE MINORITY IF THEY CAME AFTER THE TRI-PARTITE TALKS.

17 September, 1971 Thank you for your letter of 9 September about We were of course considering whether we should 
make a protest in response to this statement beyond what the Mission have already said on the record. However, we think that a formal protest might well result in losing more than we should gain. As Sir Colin Crowe points out in the last paragraph of the telegram, the Secretary-General was particularly anxious that his spokesman’s remarks should not be regarded as an initiative against Her Majesty’s Government: this was characteristic of U Thant’s cooperative attitude throughout to the Northern Ireland situation. For the past two years he has gone out of his way not to embarrass us over this problem. To lodge a formal protest now might lessen this goodwill and, if the protest leaked, interest that at the moment does not exist in U.N. circles would be stimulated. 
We think that the best course would be for 
Sir C. Crowe to speak informally to the Secretariat (or the Secretary-General himself if a suitable opportunity occurs), and remind them that briefing on the UK is something which should come from us, and not be accepted from other Missions. (An unofficial reminder on similar lines was made at the time of Mr. Gerry Fitt’s visit to New York). I enclose a draft telegram to New York in this sense and if you agree we will despatch it.

The Rt Hon Reginald Maudling MP Home Secretary House of Commons Westminster LONDON SW1 
Dear Sir 
I am sorry to trouble you on a matter which, at first sight, may appear trivial but it is of vital concern to our membership in Northern Ireland. 
The Ministry of Development in Northern Ireland have been making newspaper announcements with regard to the Rent and Rates strikes which are taking place. One of the newspaper announcements which I have seen says, amongst other things, "The Government is determined that legal powers will be sought to deduct monies due - 
including arrears - from 
all forms of State and public payments". It is assumed by our members, I think correctly, that the Government in Northern Ireland intend to withhold payment of Supplementary Benefit in order to compensate for Rent and Rates which have not been paid. This will place our Clerks on Post Office counters in the front line. 
These Government notices to which I have referred already created a situation in Newry last week where our members were fearful of violence against them because of certain Stop Payment Notices in regard to Supplementary Benefits. It was assumed by the community and by our members that these Stop Payments related to those involved in the Rent and Rates strike. 
I hope it will be possible for you to review this situation and to ensure that our members at Post Office counters are not involved in all the difficulties which will arise if the legal powers which the Government is seeking are conceded. 
I have already raised this matter with the Acting Director of the Post Office, Northern Ireland, who is sympathetic to our point of view. 
I hope it will be possible for you to make it clear to Stormont that action such as that which is proposed will expose our members

NORTHERN IRELAND. 
1. THE DAIL IS MEETING A WEEK EARLY, ON 20 OCTOBER, TO DEBATE NORTHERN IRELAND, 
HAVE THUS THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE IRISH 
GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION HAVE TO TAKE UP FORMAL PUBLIC POSITIONS, FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, CONCERNING THE HOME SECRETARY’S TALKS, MINORITY PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC LIFE, AND THE KEY ISSUE OF INTERNMENT. THE MINORITY LEADERS WHOM MR. LYNCH SAW YESTERDAY WERE EVIDENTLY UNMOVED ON THE INTERNMENT ISSUE BY WHATEVER MR. LYNCH TOLD THEM ABOUT THE CHEQUERS TALKS. MCCANN WAS SUNK IN GLOOM LAST EVENING, BUT ADMITTED HE HAD NOT YET SEEN THE TAOISEACH. HE IS IN ANY CASE EASILY EXCITED ON NORTHERN IRELAND QUESTIONS AT THE BEST OF T 
ON INTERNMENT BY SOME DEVICE OR OTHER. I URGED HIM TO SUSPEND BOTH JUDGMENT AND ADVICE TO HIS OWN PEOPLE UNTIL HE HAD HEARD MORE ABOUT THE CHEQUERS TALKS THAN RONAN AND GALLAGHER (BOTH OF WHOM RETURNED FAIRLY DEPRESSED) COULD TELL HIM. MCCANN HIMSELF HOLDS THE QUOTE CHARGE OR RELEASE UNQUOTE VIEW. 
2. FURTHER GLOOM HAS BEEN CAST ON THE SCENE BY MR. FAULKNER’S DECLARATION ON HIS RETURN TO THE EFFECT THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE ANY CATHOLIC IN HIS GOVERNMENT WHO WAS NOT A UNIONIST. SOME COMMENTATORS HAVE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE PRIME MINISTER’S REPORTED OBSERVATION THAT THE REUNIFICATION OF IRELAND WAS A LEGITIMATE. POLITICAL AIM, AND THE GENERAL OPINION IS THAT EITHER MR. FAULKNER IS TRYING TO SABOTAGE THE HOME SECRETARY’S TALKS, OR, IF H.G. 00 NOT EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY DISAVOW MR. FAULKNER ON THIS POINT THE TALKS ARE USELESS ANYWAY. 
S. HIS ADVICE WAS NATURALLY THAT WE HAD BETTER MOVE FAST

DRAFT STATEMENT ON NORTHERN IRELAND POLITICAL PROGRESS IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS BOUND TO BE 
IMPEDED SO LONG AS VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION CONTINUE: AND THE PURPOSE OF INTERNMENT, AND OF THE ARMY’S MEASURES WHICH ARE DIRECTED IMPARTIALLY AT VIOLENCE FROM WHATEVER QUARTER, IS TO RESTORE TO NORTHERN IRELAND THE NECESSARY DEGREE OF STABILITY FOR FURTHER POLITICAL ADVANCE. 
THE BORDER IS NOT AT ISSUE. NOR IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
POSITION OF NORTHERN IRELAND AS PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND, WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE PRINCIPLE OF A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED ASSEMBLY BASED ON UNIVERSAL ADULT SUFFRAGE. 
BUT THE REFORM PROGRAMME WHICH HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE 
CARRIED THROUGH AND TO WHICH BOTH THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT AND THE UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT ARE FULLY COMMITTED, TOGETHER WITH INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTICIPATION BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MINORITY ON THE LINES SUGGESTED IN MR. FAULKNER’S RECENT INITIATIVE, HAVE POINTED THE WAY FORWARD. IN DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND AND UNITED KINGDOM MINISTERS IT WAS AGREED THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND WERE TO INVITE THE HOME SECRETARY TO ARRANGE AS SOON AS THE SECURITY SITUATION HAS SUFFICIENTLY IMPROVED TALKS UNDER HIS CHAIRMANSHIP WITH THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT, REPRESENTATIVES OF BOTH SIDES OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND PARLIAMENT AND OF OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MAJORITY AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES. 
THE PURPOSE OF THESE DISCUSSIONS WILL BE TO SEE WHAT AGREED 
WAYS AND MEANS CAN BE DEVISED, WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND DEMOCRATIC FRAMEWORK, OF GIVING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MINORITY AS WELL AS OF THE MAJORITY COMMUNITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND AN ACTIVE PERMANENT AND GUARANTEED ROLE IN THE LIFE AND PUBLIC AFFAIR OF THE PROVINCE.

PRIME MINISTER There seem to be only two possible approaches to the problem of 
Northern Ireland: (1) We can go on as we are. (2) We can try to devise some new political initiative. 
2. The brief for the meeting with Mr. Lynch is based, fundamentally, on 
the former assumption, i. e. that we go on as we are, doing the best we can within the limits of certain political and constitutional assumptions which are regarded as beyond question. 
If we are honest with ourselves, however, we 
must admit that this means, essentially, that we go on living from day to day and from hand to mouth, arguing first with the North and then with the South about each successive "incident", adjusting our tactics to developments in the situation as they occur, hoping that sooner or later things will get better but always waiting on events and the reaction which they dictate. The advantage of this course is that - so far at least - it has succeeded in preventing the pot from finally boiling over; and it may, of course, continue to do so. we might be well-advised to stick to this policy. 
If so, Its disadvantage, however, 
is that it offers no permanent solution, no light at the distant end of the tunnel and, it must be admitted, no current prospect of success in the short term. On the contrary, the situation seems to be steadily deteriorating; the relations between Ulster and Eire appear to be becoming increasingly polarised; the IRA are adopting a daily more flagrant attitude of defiance towards all three Governments involved; civil disobedience in Ulster, encouraged by Dublin, is approaching the point when really serious social and economic damage could be inflicted on the Province (at the ultimate expense of the British taxpayer); and the Opposition at Westminster are beginning to try to snatch the political initiative from the Government’s hands. If this process continues, sooner or later the elastic must snap; and one of the main objections to merely "going on as we are" is that this course offers no insurance that the breaking point will not come sooner rather than later. Another objection is that disobedience and violence are apt to be infectious; and Great Britain is uncomfortably close to Northern Ireland from this point of view. 3. 
The alternative policy - i. e. a radical new political initiative - would 
be designed to anticipate the point at which the elastic snaps and to ensure that we received the credit for having tried to avert calamity while there was still time to do so. The form of such an initiative could not be decided,

BRITISH POLICY IN NORTHERN IRELAND (Note by the Central Policy Review staff) 
In 1969 and 1970 successive British Governments had a well-defined policy on Northern Ireland. Its prospects of success were promising; its assumptions were reasonable; it commanded bipartisan respect at Westminster; and it was supported by the moderate en at the head of the Governments in Belfast and Dublin. Through no fault of our own, that policy has failed. It is important to be absolutely clear about what we were trying to achieve; about the completeness of our failure; and about our need for a new policy if we are not simply to flounder. 
2. The 1969-70 policy arose from the Stormont Government’s failure 
to maintain order with its own resources. It had to call in the British Army. The Westminster Government demanded a major concession in return. That concession was the Reform Programme, designed to remove the basis for Catholic grievances. It was recognised that this Program would be unpopular with the Protestant majority which had elected the Unionist Government at Stormont. But in 1969 the next Stormont elections were still four years away. In the interval it was hoped that there would be time for the Programme to take effect; for the Catholic community to be reconciled to Unionist rule; and for the Protestant community to discover that Reform could bring peace without endangering their way of life. It would then be possible for the moderate Unionists, lead by e.g. Chichester Clark or Faulkner, to win the 1973 elections and to defeat any extremist Protestant challenge led by e.g. Craig or Paisley. 
3. One element in this policy has worked out well. Contrary to some
