EMERGENCY REINFORCEMENTS FOR HQ 39 INF BDE Reference: A. 
BACKGROUND 1.

the 11-12 units mark (9 currently deployed plus 2 or 3 Plebiscite battalions). 
HQ Northern Ireland have been re-assessing the command The 39 Brigade force level would then rise above Originally, HQ Northern Ireland asked for an 
extra brigade headquarters and, as you will have seen in reference A, HQ 19 Airptbl Bde was nominated. 
But CLF now 
believes that there are overwhelming arguments in favour of merely grafting on a temporary Staff increment, including a second deputy commander, to HQ 39 Brigade. 
THE PROPOSAL 2. 
a. In principle, HQ Northern Ireland’s proposal rests on the 
need to avoid splitting the command arrangements for the Belfast area: 
Tactical Considerations. a tactical entity. Belfast is essentially Terrorists and terrorist mobs can 
(and do) move rapidly from one part of the city to another. Similarly, arms, ammunition and explosives are moved about quickly. 
Firm control of, and rapid reaction to, 
such events can only effectively be exercised by one headquarters. 
b. Operational Experience. 
the most difficult area to control in the Province experience and background knowledge are essential. 
Operationally, Belfast is An 
extra (inexperienced) brigade headquarters would arrive on P + 4 at the earliest when the "battle" could be at its height (as was the case with HQ 24 Bde during MOTORMAN).

A/120/GEN/6103 (ASD 2a) dated 9 Jan 73. The aim of this minute is to update you on the state of 
play of our contingency planning for the reinforcement to cover the Plebiscite and the publication of the White Paper. 
ASSUMPTIONS 2. 
You will recall that you gave me, as a basis for planning, 
the following guide-lines: a. 
The Plebiscite. b. The White Paper. To deploy on 4 Mar for either a best 
case of less than 4 weeks or a worst case of up to 4 months: three battalions from UKLF. 
To be brought to notice from the day 
of publication of the White Paper (P Day): (1) At 24 hours from P Day: 
(2) At 72 hours from P Day: two battalions from UKLF.

We agree with the sentiments of ASD 17 regarding the

We confirm that the current requirement of the UKMF is for: a. b.

However, we hope to increase this to include the 2 Air Sqns from the armoured recce regiments. UKLF have been asked to provide a justification for the inclusion in the full UKMF orbat of these air squadrons which, when fitted with ATGW, will greatly assist the anti-armour capability of 3 Div. 
When this is received and 
approved (or otherwise) DS 7 will be asked to consider whether SACEUR should be informed of our increased anti-tank capability as it is one of the AD 70 recommendations.

RAF ASSISTANCE TO RMP IN NORTHERN IRELAND Reference: A. 
CGS 1180 dated 12 January 1973. 1. The RAF Department (DGPS (RAF) and PM(RAF)) have 
now confirmed that, after a further study of the problem, they are unable to increase their support to the RMP in Northern Ireland. 
2. You will recall that in addition to 45 policemen, the RAF are also helping out in Northern Ireland by finding some 9 Intelligence NCOs, 18 dog handlers and 98 technicians (to REME). I suggest that it would be contrary to out best interests to rock the boat and to return to the RAF on this issue.

CGS’s VISIT TO NORTHERN IRELAND 11-12 JANUARY 1973 
1. The main thing to come out of the visit, at th discussions in HQ Northern Ireland, was that they accepted to ally CGS’s ideas for the reinforcement at the time of the plebiscite,and the White Paper, as he put them in his minute to S of S on 10 January. They admitted that the paper on which the preliminary work had been done and which had been discussed on 10 January, was out of date. 
2. At the Gen 79 on Monday 15th therefore CGS will try to determine whether the reinforcement for the plebescite should be 2 or 3 battalions; he feels that the total to be stood by or warned should not exceed 10; that is to say if 2 are sent over, for the plebescite only 8 more should be put on standby, and if 3 for the plebescite only 7 on standby. 
3. As far as the plebescite was concerned CGS learnt nothing more of the location of the 390 polling stations at present planned. It appears that several are to be sited on or near inter-faces and these are the ones that are likely to cause most trouble according to the brigade commanders. Until the number of stations are resolved HQ Northern Ireland are unlikely to be able to confirm the actual reinforcement requirements. 
4. CGS’s visit in fact took him largely around administrative units and therefore there is no operational news to report. The briefing at HQ Northern Ireland by the 3 brigade commanders confirmed all that CGS knew from reading the various sitreps before he wentand he does not propose to put out anything in writing about the last two days. He was however told that the task force really was achieving something and was not just a public relations exercise as the GOC had stated before Christmas. Commander 39 Brigad considers the Belfast Task Force as being equal in effectiveness and usefulness to one infantry company. In the context of the police the GOC was told by PM (RAF) that the RAF Police were very keen to play a greater part in Northern Ireland. CGS would be grateful if this statement could be investigated further, as he understood that the RAF in this building were not as keen on the idea as PM (RAF)

a. Republican. BGS (Int)’s views are: 
Official IRA (Para 5) (1) 
We do not "know that they are much better armed". believe that most of arms are in the South. 
We We believe that they are better organised than the Provisional IRA. 
(2) It is not likely that the Official IRA will now publicly end their truce. 
b. 
Provisional IRA (Para 6) (1) Unlikely now to declare unilateral ceasefire. 
2. Protestant Extremists. a. b. BGS (Int)’s views are: Unlikely to take action before publication of White Paper. If reaction does take place it will follow immediately upon 
publication of White Paper rather than some days later. c. 
The most likely form of reaction is: 
(1) Immediate industrial action which would be pretty effective in Belfast. 
(2) There would not be attacks on SF at once although the action might build up to that.

Head of DS 10 NORTHERN IRELAND: FORCE LEVEL STUDY We shall not have an opportunity to discuss the paper on 
HQ NI’s force level study (MO4’s minute of 5 January). My 
major point, on the assumption that we are not seeking at this stage to re-write the paper itself,is to comment that it does not seem clear whether the recommended course of action prior to the publication of the White Paper proposes that three extra battalions and possible a Brigade Headquarters should actually be deployed into the Protestant areas of Belfast before there is a definite increase in violence. 
Paragraph 
49 suggests that this is planned; paragraph 71, however, suggests that the deployment would be in specific response to increased violence. 
My own view would be that, except where there are overriding reasons to the contrary - eg the practicability of additional troops should not be 
2. deploying people in time - 
deployed in the operational areas until there is a specific increase in the level of violence for them to counter. 
I 
think it would be difficult to show that, on balance, the additional deployment would have a deterrent rather than a provocative effect. 
Moreover, I feel that, so far as possible, 
it would be better to have the maximum number of additional units standing by in Great Britain, rather than in Northern Ireland, until it is really necessary for them to move across. I suppose it is just arguable that if the border poll is held before the White Paper is published, additional troops deployed for security duties for the border poll could be kept on for the White Paper (paragraph 50e), but the disadvantages set out in paragraph 51 seem to outweigh that point.

THE WHITE PAPER THREAT STUDY 1. The eruption of Protestant violence in October 1972 
demonstrated the ability and determination of extremists to report to areas to protect their interests. 
Since then, 
Protestant extremists have publicly avowed their intention of opposing any solution to the Northern Ireland problem which diminishes Protestant power. 
As the Catholics hold the opposite 
view, any compromise solution proposed by HMG which seeks to unify the mass of moderate citizens on each side of the sectarian divide will probably be opposed by the extremists in both oommunities. 
Thus the publication of HMG’s White Paper of 
legislative proposals for the future of Northern Ireland in early 1973 could provide the catalyst for a resumption of Protestant violence.

His assessment is therefore unlikely to be From military 
intelligence sources, it is already clear that the threat is sufficiently grave to warrant the preparation of contingency plans. Assumptions 2. 
This paper assumes that HMG’s legislation proposals for 
the future of Northern Ireland will seek to strike a compromise between the views of both opposing sets of extremists. 3. 
It also assumes that if Protestant violence erupts the 
majority of Protestants will remain passive and not actively support the extremists.

26th January 1973. Knowing your close personal interest in Northern Ireland, 
I venture to send you, once again, an account of my latest visit. To summarise and save you reading what I have to say, my 
suggestions would be:- 
(1) An urgent need to end the political vacuum at the earliest possible date; 
(2) To solve the very difficult problems created by the RUC. 
(3) To take advantage of Irish willingness to enter into a treaty with us to rid them of the embarrassment of Clauses 2 and 3 of the 1937 Constitution. 
(4) To ensure that the Apostolic Nuncio in Dublin is kept closely informed as to developments. 
I would like to stress how highly Willie Whitelaw and his team are regarded by all moderate opinion I encountered. 
We 
all know that the extremists of both wings are going to howl when the White Paper comes out, but the plunge has got to be taken sooner or later, and the best hope lies in the howls being as nearly equally loud as possible. 
The Prime Minister The Rt. Hon. Edward Heath, MBE, MP 10 Downing Street London, S.W.l.

Notwithstanding my Times letter, which he showed no He expressed complete support for the Administration 
("never has a British team done so much to help us"), and said he hoped that minor criticisms of the Army would not be thought of as a blanket condemnation since "no other army in the world would have behaved so well under provocation". 
He admits that the 
Catholic Church and Community must bear a heavy load of responsibility for communal troubles and agrees that they must adopt a more sympathetic approach to genuine Protestant difficulties. 
He paid an ad limina (i.e. periodic, routine) visit 
to Rome in the Autumn and assured me that he had made the British position abundantly clear to the Secretary of State and to the Pope. 
He had gone especially to the Irish College and was 
prepared to assure me that there were no IRA priests in the pipeline: also that there were none of whom he was aware of in his diocese. 
Catholic Community should stop sulking and start to play a part in every aspect of the Province’s life. 
He agreed with me that it was high time that the Whether, within the

If people in Belfast are now cautiously telling you 
how Irish they are, people in Dublin are now beginning to talk with pride about their British service connections! I first visited Dublin myself in 1940 and have been there about three times a year since 1952 and I have never known the man in the street more spontaneously pro-British. 
This attitude is reflected in political circles. There 
is far more understanding of the magnitude of the problems we face in Ulster and far greater realisation that it will be many years before they have the financial and military resources to lift the burden from us. 
any White Paper that provides for a meaningful Council of Ireland but I retain the impression that despite the extraordinary success achieved by Sir John Peck, they still find HMS somewhat cold and remote and all my instincts suggest to me that they are correct. Repeated hints, for example, that they would like An Anglo-Irish Treaty to relieve them of the encumberance of Clauses 2 and 3 of the 1937 Constitution have all fallen on stony ground, and Dr Whitaker, who reverted to this subject repeatedly in conversation with me, certainly speaks the mind of the Taoiseach.

outline suggestions for An Anglo-Irish Treaty and in December sent Tony Royle an excerpt from Professor Norman Gibson’s lecture in Dublin, together with Dr Whitaker’s observations thereon. 
This latter I repeat together with a paper in 
which he expands on his ideas. I am aware that there may be risks in being seen 
hob-nobbing in Dublin so far as Protestant sentiment is concerned but with regular contacts now going on in Brussels and Strasbourg it seems strange that there is so little contact between Belfast and Dublin, particularly since the tacit abandonment of Clauses 2 and 3 of the 1937 Constitution would do more to allay Protestant anxiety - and hence bring the parties together anything.

He wished me to stress to HMG that, insofar as "Rome 
rule" exists, it is HIM; but that his "kingdom" is confined to two acres of garden! It is his view that the Irish Government is the most secular administration to which he has ever been accredited. 
He would like to see a United Ireland but implored me to

Northern Ireland: The Timetable The meeting of GEN 79 has a very full agenda. But, whether or not 
the meeting manages to get through all of it, I think it important that Ministers should, on this occasion, reach a firm decision whether the White Paper is to be published before or after the Border poll, which is to be held on 8th March. 2. 
should be left open for further consideration. 
At the last meeting, on 15th January, you said that this question If a decision is not reached 
now, it will in practice be a decision in favour of publication after the poll, i.e. about 21st March, since even now we have only about three weeks if we are to publish before the poll (because the latest date would need to be the last week in February). 3. 
The Secretary of State has made clear his preference for holding the 
poll first. He can reasonably argue that there is still a good deal of work to be done in preparing the White Paper; and that there is a reasonable chance that the poll will take place without too much trouble if it comes first. On the other hand, we have had the JIC assessment that the amount of trouble when the White Paper is published is likely to be about the same whether we have it before or after the poll. Moreover, to have the poll first will play into the hands of the Protestants, who reckon that a heavy majority in the poll will give them additional justification for demanding that Protestant views should determine the future constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland. Their reaction to the White Paper itself will be proportionately stronger if it comes after the poll. By contrast, the non-sectarian, moderate Alliance Party want the White Paper to come first; and this view is probably still held both by other non-sectarian groups and by the Roman Catholics (even if they are going to abstain in fairly large numbers on the poll in any event). The Secretary of State can perhaps confirm that these are still the current attitudes of the respective parties; and he may also be able to indicate whether the Opposition at Westminster are likely to take a similar position. In my own view logic still puts the White Paper before the poll; but I could not claim that this should prevail against a balance of political advantage which inclined in the opposite direction.

Financial Arrangements for Northern Ireland (GEN 79(73)/3) 
In paragraph 7 of the Annex to GEN 79(73) the Secretary of State for 
Northern Ireland proposed that, while keeping control of the total demand which Northern Ireland makes on United Kingdom resources, we should give the new Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive much greater freedom in the determination of priorities for expenditure than the previous Northern Ireland Government possessed. 
He suggested that this would promote a 
sense of responsibility within the new Administration and would make a political career more attractive to men of ability in the Province. 
In the 
present memorandum the Chief Secretary sets out in rather more specific terms the Treasury’s thinking on the way in which Mr. Whitelaw’s suggestion might be implemented. 2. 
The Chief Secretary proposes that Northern Ireland public 
expenditure as a whole should continue to be settled through the existing arrangements for the Public Expenditure Survey, i.e. with full regard to our general public expenditure policies. 
But within this framework he 
proposes to establish two different categories of programmes. The first category would remain subject to much the same arrangements as at present for determining specific allocations and regulating expenditure within them. It would comprise expenditure on law and order (responsibility for which will be reserved to Westminster); on social security (which must be on the basis of exact parity with Great Britain); on agriculture and fisheries (where we shall be closely involved in negotiations in the EEC about policies for the whole of the United Kingdom); and on assistance to industry and employment (where we must not only have regard to the EEC considerations but must also ensure that account is taken of our general industrial policies and of the problems of the development areas generally). The second category comprises all other areas of public expenditure in Northern Ireland; and, as shown in the table in the Annex, it amounts to rather more than half of the total of Northern Ireland public expenditure. 
the Northern Ireland institutions would have a high degree of freedom to determine relative priorities and to reallocate funds between programmes, 
Within this category

a sentry opened fire on an armed intruder without hitting him, and near Bessbrook 3 gunmen ambushed a mobile patrol but did not inflict any casualties.

Note of a meeting held at 11.45 am on Monday 15 January at 10 Downing Street 
Those present: The Prime Minister (in the Chair) Lord Carrington Mr. Whitelaw Mr. Prior Mr. Pym Sir Michael Fraser Mr. Hurd 
The Prime Minister said that there were two problems to be considered. 
The 
first was the short-term question of how we should react if Mr. Faulkner were re- 
placed as Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party by an extremist such as Mr. Craig. It would then be necessary to break the links between the organisations and the procedure for doing this was set out on the first page of Sir Michael Fraser’s supplementary paper dated 12 January. 
Mr. Whitelaw said that it was right 
to consider this possibility, but the present information was that Mr. Faulkner would be able to retain his position for the time being. 
If he were ousted and 
we had to proceed as envisaged in Sir Michael Fraser’s paper, we might have to reckon with considerable opposition from Party supporters in the country. 
other hand, this problem might be easier if, as seemed likely, the position in Northern Ireland would at that stage be very confused. 
might therefore be a question of which Party we recognised.

This is a "strategic" memorandum, in the sense that it is confined to 
describing the basic features of the constitutional settlement which Mr. Whitelaw envisages and indicating the timetable of action, both Parliamentary and other, by which he hopes to bring that settlement into effective operation. A good many points of detail are left undefined, for subsequent consideration on the basis of individual memoranda yet to be written. 2. 
This is a sensible approach to the subject - always provided that 
we do not commit ourselves so firmly at this stage to the skeletal structure of the settlement that, when we subsequently come to put flesh on the bones, we find that we are creating a misshapen monster: 
Until we have examined 
the more detailed memoranda, therefore, our conclusions about the basic principles should remain as provisional as is compatible with effective action. 3. 
This is directly relevant to the Secretary of State’s own conception of 
the settlement, which is essentially "evolutionary" in the sense that it envisages the emergence of a new constitution by successive stages over a period of time which seems unlikely to be completed much before the end of this year. There are certain advantages in this approach. 
It keeps the 
situation fluid to some extent; and it therefore gives us a degree of flexibility in manoeuvring the conflicting interests into the least inharmonious positions. And it presumably allows us - at least in theory - to arrest the process at any stage and even, if necessary, to reverse engines. 
But there are 
corresponding disadvantages. The rather protracted course which Mr. Whitelaw suggests maximises the occasions of disturbance and prolongs the period in which disaffection and opposition can be organised against us. It imposes a correspondingly heavy and extended liability on us in terms of the maintenance of law and order. Before endorsing the Secretary of State’s suggestions in principle, therefore, the Committee should perhaps consider the alternative approach, whereby the settlement would represent a single act on our partcomplete in itself and made effective at one point of time. From many points of view this is more attractive particularly in so far as it is psychologically more decisive and politically more compact. But the price might be high, particularly if we encountered

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland invited the Prime 
Minister to lunch on 11 January, 1973, to outline his ideas for the next stage in Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State said that, as a result of a great 
number of talks which he had with the political parties in Northern Ireland and with others, he had come to the conclusion that the Government should not try to present a completely cut and dried and detailed constitutional settlement in the White Paper. 
He saw 
great advantage in leaving an element in the new arrangements to be decided by Northern Ireland opinion for itself, within limits laid down from Westminster. 
His proposal therefore was that the 
White Paper, which should be published as soon as possible after the plebiscite on the border issue (which he proposed should be held on 8 March), should announce that there would be elections for a new legislative assembly. 
Since there would not be enough 
time to redraw constituency boundaries before an election, the election would have to be on straight majority voting in existing Northern Ireland constituencies. increased to 80 - 
The size of the assembly could be the size which most people wanted - by the cooption 
of additional members in proportion to the party distribution of votes cast; coopted members would have to have stood for election. The assembly would be neither a Parliament nor a county council but would have powers to legislate within clearly defined fields which would be laid down in the White Paper and would exclude security (though the leader of the assembly might be brought into a Security Council chaired by the Secretary of State). 
The White 
Paper would then say that it would be for the Assembly after its election to make proposals to the Secretary of State as to how the powers would be exercised, and the White Paper would have to define the parameters within which the exercise of the powers would have to

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 0700 HRS 5 JANUARY T0 0700 HRS 8 JANUARY 1973 GENERAL 1. 
During the week-end the level of major violence was lower than during 
recent week-ends. There were 59 shooting incidents of which 36 involved SF, compared with 77 (47) for the period 29 Dec to 1 Jan 73. There were 4 explosions. One officer was wounded, one civilian was killed and three were wounded. The civilian casualties were all the result of unexplained shootings. 2. 
Maire Drumm was elected acting President of the Provisional Sinn Fein in 
Dublin. Drumm lives in Andersontown, has one son in the Maze prison and she has previously served 6 months for encouraging people to join the IRA. She has never wavered from a hard line and is unlikely to change now. 
3. The level of hooliganism in Belfast, Londonderry and the Provincial 
towns was higher than it has been over recent week-ends. The worst episodes were in the Creggan in Londonderry where SF had to fire over 60 baton rounds on two occasions to disperse crowds of rioting youths. This violence was sparked off by a PD rally and may be a precursor to events to mark the anniversary 
at the end of the month.

OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1. 
General. The level of violence in December was similar to that in 
the second half of November although the number of shooting incidents in which the Security Forces were involved fell from a daily average 17 in November to 12 in December. 
Security Forces more than doubled during the month. 
The number of incidents not involving the There were fewer 
explosions (57 as opposed to 82) and the IRA’s threat to escalate violence before Christmas did not materialise. 
over the period 2359 hr 22 December to 2359 hr 25 December they would not undertake offensive operations against the Security Forces. 
The Provisional IRA declared that In the 
event although acts of terrorism continued the number in which Security Forces were attacked was greatly reduced. 
Unsolved murders It was interesting that over 
the Christmas holidays the Civil Rights rallies were very poorly attended. There were 9 further rocket attacks by the IRA using Russian made RPG 7 launchers, but none on the scale of the co-ordinated attacks which took place on 28 November (see November Monthly Report). 
continue to cause concern, but the establishment of an RMP/RUC Task Force has had some success in reducing these killings in East Belfast. 
Security 
Forces successes against the Provisional IRA have been considerable and have weakened their ability to operate as a cohesive organisation. Security Forces have also achieved considerable successes against Protestant extremists who continue to avoid a confrontation with the Security Forces and have concentrated their efforts against isolated members of the Catholic Community. 
In the Republic the authorities have shown signs that they 
intend to clamp down on terrorists with their ’Offences against the State’ Act and the arrest of three prominent IRA men.

SUMMARY OF SECURITY FORCES ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE OPERATION MOTORMAN 31 JULY - 31 DECEMBER 1972 
1. Despite the withdrawal of nine IS battalions since the implementation of 
Operation MOTORMAN, Phase 3 of the operation, the build up of intelligence and the removal of key terrorists, continues. Though neutralisation of the IRA has not been completely achieved, vigorous and successful actions by the Security Forces have seriously reduced the IRA’s morale and made the most encouraging inroads into their command structure. Simultaneously, with the development of Protestant militancy and a more general polarisation of the communities, SF have had to look to both directions and a good deal of military effort has been devoted to counteracting extreme Protestant groups. Some measure of the endeavour is reflected in the following statistics which cover the period since Operation MOTORMAN was launched (31 July) to the end of 1972:

2. 3. 4. Major Units in the Infantry Role. Armoured Reconnaissance.

Of the 18 major units in the infantry

The number of squadrons remains at 4. The number of squadrons is now 4. 
ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT 5. 
The strength of the UDR as at 31 December 1972 was 8,959. This represents 
a decrease of 197 on the previous month. This decrease is as a result of less applications( and the new policy to weed out those members who have a poor attendance record. 
DETENTION 6. 
a. By 29 December the Commissioners had reviewed the cases of 167 men who had 
been interned and ordered the release of 63. The following remain interned/ detained as at 31 December 1972: 
10 interned under the previous powers whose cases have not yet 
been reviewed by the Commissioners. b. 
teen reviewed by the Commissioners. c. 
d. 106 detained under the previous powers whose cases have not yet 104 who were previously interned and whose cases have been 
reviewed by the Commissioners who have ordered that they should be detained. 
72 detained since the introduction of the Commission and held under interim custody orders until their cases are heard by the Commissioners. 
It should be noted that since the introduction of the "Detention of Terrorists" (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 on 7 November 1972 there have been 265 arrests with a view to possible detention. Apart from the 72 who have had interim custody orders served on them, a further 17 have had criminal charges brought against them. 
CEASEFIRE POLICY 7. 
It is possible that the Provisional IRA, as part of their plan to gain 
political respectability, will try to reach a negotiated truce. Mr Whitelaw has said that he will not negotiate with the Provisionals again as their behaviour towards the ceasefire of June/July 1972 has-demonstrated that they are completely untrustworthy. Therefore the Secretaries of State for Defence and Northern Ireland have agreed that in future, should the Provisionals express a wish for a ceasefire, they should be advised to cease firing. The Security Forces would continue to take action against those who break the law or who engage in terrorist activities. In fact for the Army it would be "business as usual" at least until there were real signs of the intention of a ceasefire being translated into fact. Should this good faith be exhibited then clearly political and military activity would be reconsidered.

Annex E to A/BR/30/3/1/MO4 Dated January 1973 
TRAINING COUNTER BOOBY TRAP TRAINING 1. 
Booby traps are becoming more frequent, especially in unoccupied buildings: 
the greatest care needs to be taken by all units to ensure that all ranks are "booby trap conscious". The probable reasons for this increased use of booby traps are: 
a. b. 2. 3. 4. The terrorists, faced with a general shortage of explosives due 
to SF activities, are now trying to make better use of their available resources. 
The waning support of the civilian population tends to make the terrorist go for a SF booby trap policy. 
The recent tragic death of a staff sergeant caused by a booby trapped 
rocket motor exploding, again re-emphasises the need for an acute sense of awareness of possible booby traps. 
Formal orders must be given frequently warning all ranks not to touch 
suspicious objects under any circumstances. Failure to comply with this order has led to a number of tragedies recently. 
To give more help to units training for operations in Northern Ireland, 
an ATO is to be attached to each NITAT. This officer will be in constant liaison with CATO HQ Northern Ireland to ensure that the latest lessons and terrorist techniques can be rapidly passed to units. 
5. Farther details of terrorist bomb activities during December 1972 are 
given at Appendix 1. NEGLIGENT DISCHARGES 6. 
There were 23 negligent discharges in December 1972. In one of these 
accidents a civilian was killed. A summary of the negligent discharges for November and December 1972, together with a summary of all negligent discharges since June 1972 is at Appendix 2. A welcome reduction from the very high totals of July, August and September is showh,but it must be remembered that there has been a significant reduction in force levels since those months. Clearly every effort must be made to reduce further these incidents, which not only result in casualties, but also give rise to more enmity against the Army. 
No 4 T SNIPER RIFLE 7. 
With the return into service of this weapon, the revised alternative 
unloading drill has been forgotten by many. The sear and magazine catch of this weapon share the same spring, thus if the spring is weak and the magazine catch if fully released, as it will be if the magazine is removed, there is a chance that the sear will drop and the round in the breach be fired. The User Handbook for the Rifles, 7.62 mm, L42A1 and L39A1 and Telescopes, Straight, Sighting L1A1 and Scout Regiment (Army Code No 60704) details the correct methods of unloading at Paragraph 23. The essential point is that the breach should always be fully open before the magazine is removed. 
TAMPERING WITH BATON ROUNDS 8. 
Instances are ocurring of tampering with Baton Rounds for training 
purposes, by removing the projectile or by removing part of the propellant charge, to allow realistic training with a live enemy. It is stressed that this should not on any account be allowed for the following reasons:

Jan 73 
TERRORIST BOMB TECHNIQUES 1. 
Use of Dustbins. Captured terrorist literature describes the 
dustbin as being a good airtight container for Nitrobenzine mixes. 2. 
Anonymous Telephone Calls. Cases continue to occur of terrorists 
using anonymous telephone calls to lure troops into areas which are booby trapped. 
The utmost caution must continue to be exercised in any

3. Hiding Places for Explosives. Cars continue to be found with 
traces of explosives in their door panels; cases have been known where about 100 pounds of explosives have been concealed in door panels. 
innocent drivers have been intimidated into carrying explosives in this manner. 
There is also evidence that female terrorists have been 
instructed to use hair lacquer or other strong smelling perfumes in order to conceal the smell of Nitrobenzine. 
4. Double Bombs. 
happened in Belfast where a parcel bomb was followed by a car bomb 20 minutes later in the same area. 
These have so far been rare, but a case has recently Fortunately the Security Forces were 
suspicious and no casualties were suffered but all units are warned now to expect this hazard in the future. 
5. Car Bombs. These continue to be a main feature in the terrorist’s bombing programme and they have been used throughout the Province. Many 
car bombs have been neutralised by our EOD teams but it would help them if units could pass back reports on suspicious cars more rapidly.

TO PRIORITY FCO TELNO 7 OF 4 JANUARY/INFO UKREP BELFAST. YOUR TELNO 2: COUNCIL OF IRELAND. 
1. MR LENIHAN, THE NEW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, GAVE A SMALL RECEPTION YESTERDAY AFTERNOON TO MEET THE HEADS OF MISSION. I HAVE BEEN FRIENDLY WITH HIM FOR A LONG TIME AND WE HAD QUITE. A SUBSTANTIAL TALK DURING WHICH HE ASKED ME TO COME FOR A FULL DISCUSSION BEFORE I LEAVE. 
2. HE SAID HE WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN THE NORTH, AND THEN GAVE ME HIS VIEWS ON THE FORMATION OF A COUNCIL OF IRELAND. HE HAD EVIDENTLY SEEN MCDONOUGH SINCE HIS RETURN FROM LONDON, BUT THE NOTEWORTHY POINT IS THAT HE STRESSED SEVERAL TIMES THE NEED TO START WITH A VERY MODEST STRUCTURE CAPABLE OF EVOLVING INTO SOMETHING IMPORTANT. IN FACT HIS POSITION WAS MUCH NEARER TO OURS THAN TO THAT OF HIS OWN OFFICIALS. 
3. AS MCDONOUGH WAS ALSO AT THE PARTY I ASKED HIM HOW HE HAD GOT ON AND HE MADE THE SAME GLOOMY NOISES, STRESSING HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO SELL ANYTHING SO MODEST AS WE PROPOSED TO THE IRISH PUBLIC. I THINK THIS IS RUBBISH, AND NOT THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFFICIALS THINKING THEY KNOW MORE POLITICS THAN THEIR OWN POLITICIANS. 
4. THE CONCLUSION, I SUGGEST, IS THAT WHILE THE SECRET MEETINGS ARE HELD AT OFFICIAL LEVEL IN LONDON, I, AND MY SUCCESSOR WHEN HE ARRIVES, SHOULD BE KEPT FULLY INFORMED AND SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO ENSURE THAT AFTER EACH ROUND THE MINISTER GETS OUR VIEWS DIRECT AND NOT EDITED AND FILTERED BY HIS OFFICIALS. I COULD MAKE A START WHEN I TAKE UP HIS OFFER OF A TALK. 
5. I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.

C W Roberts Esq 10 D

Thank you for your letter of 2 January in which you said that the Prime Minister would be glad to know what evidence we have about responsibility for the 3 car bomb explosions in the Republic on 28 December. 
As you know, the JIC Assessment of these incidents in JIC(A)(73)(SA) (IR)1 of 3 January covers this and, having discussed this assessment this morning with Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Ministry of Defence we have nothing further to add.

1. FIRST MEETING WITH IRISH TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY. THE AMBASSADOR WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MCDONOUGH FROM DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. OUR REPRESENTATIVES WERE CRAWFORD AND WHITE FROM FCO AND WOODFIELD AND TREVELYAN FROM N10. 2. WE EXPLAINED THAT THE FORM OF A POSSIBLE COUNCIL OF IRELAND DEPENDED A GREAT DEAL ON THE SORT OF SETTLEMENT FOR NORTHERN IRELAND DECIDED ON BY HMG, AND MR. WHITELAWS CONSULTATIONS WERE STILL PROCEEDING AND MIGHT WELL OCCUPY MOST OF JANUARY. ONLY THEREAFTER WOULD MINISTERS CONSIDER THE ELEMENTS OF THE SETTLEMENT. ANY VIEWS WE EXPRESSED WOULD THEREFORE HAVE TO BE TENTATIVE AND THERE WAS LITTLE WE COULD YET SAY ABOUT THE DETAILED WORKING OF A POSSIBLE COUNCIL. ON THE OTHER HAND WE SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO HEAR ANY SUGGESTIONS THE IRISH WOULD LIKE TO PUT FORWARD. 3. 0’ SULLIVAN SAID THAT THE IRISH REALISED THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF A COUNCIL OF IRELAND WOULD HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE GENERAL SETTLEMENT IN GENERAL, THEY ENVISAGED A COUNCIL OF MINISTER AND AN ASSEMBLY OF PARLIAMENTARIANS FROM NORTH AND SOUTH. IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT IT SHOULD NOT BECOME A MERE TALKING-SHOP 
SHOULD BE GIVEN TO IT. 4. IN SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSION WE MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS (A) THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE NORTHERN IRELAND SETTLEMENT WOULD HAVE EVOLUTIONARY ELEMENTS. MOREOVER MANY SUBJECTS IN THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FIELDS WOULD CONCERN WESTMINSTER AS MUCH AS OR MORE THAN STORMONT. THIS COVERED MOST EEG SUBJECTS. (B) THERE WOULD BE NO POINT IN HAVING A COUNCIL OF IRELAND WHICH WAS BOYCOTTED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MAJORITY IN THE NORTH. THIS 
, AS WELL AS CONSIDERATION IN (A) , SUGGESTED THAT COUNCIL 
SHOULD START AS SOMETHING NOT TOO AMBITIOUS, WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF IT EVOLVING WITH EXPERIENCE. CONCEIVABLY, IT COULD BEGIN THROUGH A COMMTTIEE OF OFFICIALS, AND GROWN TO INCLUDE MINISTERS AND PARLIAMENTARIANS AT A LATER STAGE.

Rev Martin Smyth Captain Sir George Clark Lt Col George E Liddle Rev S E Long Rev John Brown Mr James Molyneaux MP 
Mr Whalley Mr Orr 
THE NATURE OF CONSULTATIONS 
The Orange Lodge asked why it had not been possible for them to see the Prime Minister on his recent visit to Northern Ireland although he had met deputations from the Churches and the ladies from the Bogside. The Lodge felt that they were constantly being rebuffed by senior Ministers in situations when they should have been consulted. As the organisers of the Covenant the previous year they represented the democratic interests of 350,000 people. They were always prepared to meet and discuss and would be glad to share their problems with the Secretary of State’s colleagues. They basically believed that a stronger Parliament should be restored to Northern Ireland and that an early general election should be held so that such a Parliament could draw its authority from the people. 
The Secretary of State said that the present discussions he was holding were on a broader basis than those which had been held at Darlington. He had not yet put proposals to his colleagues but would report to them the various views put to him. He explained that the Prime Minister’s programme on his recent visit had been governed by restrictions of time. It had therefore been decided that his discussions should be mainly confined to the political parties in Northern Ireland, but the Secretary of State said that he would bear in mind the Lodge’s offer of further consultations. Insofar as there had been misunderstandings over the Prime Minister’s visit, the Secretary of State expressed regret.

4 January 1973 
J T Williams Esq Northern Ireland Office Great George Street London SW1 
Arrest Policy: Protestants Two important decisions have been taken here at Stormont Castle in the last two days. 
2. At the morning meeting on 2 January the Secretary of State expressed anxiety to take some visible effective action to deal with the assassinations. The Chief Constable suggested that if it happened that Protestant extremists suspected of murder or other terrorist crime had to be let go after interrogation by the CID they should be re-arrested under Regulation 11 and interrogated by the Special Branch. The Secretary of State agreed that this should happen and said that if the Special Branch interrogation pointed to the preparation of submissions for interim custody orders he would be quite prepared for this. In principle there is nothing new in this, since the Secretary of State has always said that he would be prepared to detain some Protestant extremists if a proper case were made out. The new element is that some orders for the custody of Protestants are likely now soon to be made. 
3. 
and as not in itself constituting any formal change of arrest policy, since any interim custody orders would be incidental to action taken 
The Secretary of State evidently regarded this decision as a first step against 
suspected murderers and terrorists. He preferred this step to another suggestion, made by the GOC, that the RUC should re-examine, with a view to the making of custody orders, the list of the 50 or so men apprehended and released at the drinking club in the Shankill on the famous night when Gusty Spence, along with the greater part of the command structure of the UVF, was alleged to have slipped through the fingers of the security forces. 
4. The Secretary of State said that he would also look again at the five 
specimen cases recently submitted to him of Protestant extremists who might be made the subject of interim custody orders. What he had in mind was that if it were possible to put two or three bad men inside as a result of investigations into their being suspected of murder or other terrorist crime he might at the same time make orders on another two or three Protestant extremists on the basis of information about their activities not necessarily related to specific criminal incidents. These latter two or three might be from the five specimen cases. He has since looked at these specimen cases and decided that there would be good grounds for making custody orders in at least two cases. (It does not follow that orders will in fact be made.) 
5. The second decision was taken at the morning meeting on 3 January, when 
arrest policy was formally considered on the basis of Army papers 113G of 9 December and 12 December. The decision was that the present arrest instructions are amended with immediate effect by the introduction of a

ARREST INSTRUCTIONS (REVISED) 
a. Anyone against whom there is known to be evidence to justify the preferring of criminal charges. b. 
Anyone against whom there s thought to be evidence which might, after 
questioning, justify the preferring of criminal charges. If it emerges, during questioning, that an arrested person cannot be charged, then irrespective of whether he is a member of the Provisional IRA, consideration will be given to a possible application for an interim custody order, where the grounds appear to be sufficient. c. 
Anyone known to be holding officer rank in the Provisional IRA even 
though there is no evidence to justify criminal charges. d. 
Provisional IRA volunteers, who, on the strength of reliable 
intelligence, are known to be an exceptionally serious threat to security. e. 
Other terrorists who are known, on the basis of a joint intelligence 
assessment, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an interim custody order. f. 
Anyone in the company of a person arrested "red-handed" if the 
arresting soldier suspects him of having committed or being about to commit an act prejudicial to peace.

1. SECURITY REVIEW The GOC and Chief Constable reported a generally quiet 24-hour period. 
The Secretary of State agreed to the establishment of a joint RMP/RUC Task Force in Londonderry on the lines of that already operating in Belfast. 
To counter allegations of lack of activity on the part of the security forces in relation to recent murders in Belfast it was decided that the Information Service might release news about the establishment of a separate control room for the Task Force in Belfast. 
Arising out of a discussion about the interpretation of the word "illegal", Lord Windlesham asked Mr Harris and Mr Macmahon to co-operate in producing a short brief on the application of the term to organisations and their uniforms. 
2. ARREST POLICY (Resumed Discussion) 
The meeting had before it HQNI Paper 1113G of 12 December, para 7(e) of which would have been modified by the decision taken at the Secretary of State’s meeting of 13 December (SSM (72) 118 Item 2). 
The GOC said that subsequent discussions between his HQ and NIO Belfast had revealed that the proposed modification would have introduced unforeseen difficulties. After further discussion it was agreed that the sub-paragraph should read as follows:"Other terrorists who are known, on the basis of a joint intelligence assessment, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an Interim Custody Order." 
The meeting noted that the Army Paper was intended for limited distribution and took the view that no suggestion should be made in any quarter of any fundamental change being made in arrest policy.
