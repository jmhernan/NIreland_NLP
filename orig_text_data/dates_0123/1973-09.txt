PEACETIME STRUCTURE OF THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND 1. 
Headquarters Northern Ireland sent a paper on the peacetime 
structure for the Army in Northern Ireland to the Ministry of Defence on 1 Aug 73. This paper makes a case for a force level of one resident armoured reconnaissance regiment and six resident infantry battalions in Northern Ireland as a permanent garrison once the situation has returned to ’normal’. 
2. I held a meeting on 24 Sep 73 attended by DASD, VQMG and Head 
of DS10 to consider how the paper should be dealt with. Apart from the political considerations in such a force level, which would be three times as large as the previous peacetime infantry force level in Northern Ireland, it would involve the building of a new barracks in Northern Ireland (for the 6th battalion) and the acquisition of a major training area. 
3. At first sight there could be some advantage in formally endorsing 
a long term force level of 6 resident infantry battalions, particularly where it comes to defending the size of the infantry order of battle in the context of the Defence Studies Working Group or similar exercises in future. But the underlying arguments in support of the six battalion garrison are not particularly convincing, since they necessarily rest, in large measure, on an estimate of the level of lawless activity which would pertain in "normal" times, and in the capability at that time of the RUC to deal with it. And in practical terms there is considerable advantage in maintaining some roulement element within the force level once we have brought the total down to 12 or less. The use of roulement battalions provides more operational duty time, and also helps to spread expertise and sense of purpose over the Army as a whole. I understand that AG’s conference has laid particular emphasis on this aspect. 
4. There are 2 further arguments against attempting to crystallise a 
resident infantry force level as high as six battalions. First, we have to face the possibility of losing up to, say, four battalions from the order of battle for reasons connected with recruiting and finance. If this happens, then a resident force level of six battalions in Northern Ireland could entail reducing either a brigade of 3 Division or the Parachute Brigade by at least one battalion (depending on what happens to NZUK Brigade and Cyprus SBA). More importantly, it is extremely doubtful,

In your letter to Bill Mumford of 20th September 
you mentioned that the Prime Minister, in approving the proposal not to replace two Army units which are due to leave Northern Ireland in October and November, had added the comment that the reduction should be so planned that the withdrawal of troops from Catholic and Protestant areas should be balanced. I confirm that this will be the case. Both these first stage reductions will be made in Belfast, but there is of course no question of leaving any area completely uncovered: as is always necessary when a reduction takes place, unit boundaries and deployments will be adjusted and this will be done in such a way that the coverage of Catholic and Protestant areas will be in approximately the same proportions as at present. 
It has been decided, in consultation with the Secretary 
of State for Northern Ireland, that the units affected by the decision should be informed tomorrow afternoon. 
I am sending copies of this letter to the Private 
Secretaries to the other members of GEN 79 and to Brian Webster.

Enc1 3 to A/BR/20/M04 September 1973 
PEACETIME STRUCTURE FOR THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND Reference: A: 
HQ NI letter 1060 G dated 1 August 1973. 1. At a meeting held by DMO and attended by DASD, VQMG and Head of DS10 on 
24 September 1973 it was decided that it was not practicable to continue with the study of the peacetime structure for the Army in Northern Ireland, initiated in Reference A, until such time as the results of the present studies of the Public Expenditure Standing Committee are known. 
2. However, since it would appear that it might be necessary to maintain a 
force level of 12 battalions and one resident armoured reconnaissance regiment in Northern Ireland for sometime to come, it was considered that the camps in which the 8 roulement battalions would live should if possible be improved, especially those which are likely to be occupied for longest. 
3. Would you therefore please consider where you think it likely that the 8 
roulement units in a 12 battalion force level will be stationed and if possible say which are likely to be occupied longest in a gradually reducing force level. It is appreciated that you may not be able to go as far as this, but if you are able to state the likely station for a number of these battalions, this will suffice.

NORTHERN IRELAND: FORCE LEVELS When the Secretary of State minuted the Prime Minister on 
19 September about the proposal not to replace two units which are due to leave Northern Ireland in October and November, he mentioned that it was intended:- 
a. 
to inform the units concerned within a few days of the proposal being approved, subject to a final check with SSNI that the timing was satisfactory from his point of view (the assumption being that the news would soon become public once the notifications had been made); 
b. 
not to volunteer a public statement about the reduction, but to be ready to answer questions about it 
- the answers having been agreed with the NIO. 
No. 10’s letter to you of 20 September conveying the Prime Minister’ approval did not contain any comment on either of these points. 
2. 
to notify the two units which will not now be required in Northern Ireland 
Germany - tomorrow afternoon, 26 September. This will have the 
advantage of making it unnecessary for 7 Para RHA to embark on their final work-up programme for service in Northern Ireland, which they would otherwise have to commence at the beginning of next week and which would of course be a waste of time and effort unless they were actually due to go to Northern Ireland. Mr Whitelaw has been consulted by the GOC about this timing,and is content. 
NIO in Belfast is attached for information. 3.

the reduction should be so planned that the withdrawal of troops from Catholic and Protestant areas should be balanced.

MA/CGS NORTHERN IRELAND FORCE LEVEL REDUCTIONS You will see from the attached letter from No 10 
of yesterday’s date that the Prime Minister has agreed to the proposal that the Northern Ireland force levels be reduced by two battalions during October and November of this year. I understand that the Prime Minister’s proviso that the withdrawal of units be balanced as between Catholic and Protestant areas has already been met in the selection of units which are not to be replaced. 
The Secretary of State would be grateful if the necessary action could now be set in hand.

FORCE LEVELS REDUCTIONS 1. 
US of S(Army), in a round-up meeting with me before he went 
on tour, raised one or two points on PR aspects: a. 
b. He believes that we shall have to go rather further 
than simply saying that force levels are kept under constant review. 
We shall have to be prepared to disclose the identity 
of the units not being replaced. c. 
The emphasis should be on developments in the situation 
in Northern Ireland which permit this - we should not accept imputations that the changes are dictated by personnel considerations. 
d. reinforcement 
We should so emphasise the possibility of further need. 
I believe that all these points have been very much in our own minds, but since US of S(Army) raised them with me specifically I thought that I ought to put them on record.

With your minute of 17th September you circulated SSNI’s reply 
concurring with our proposal to go ahead with the first stage of the reduction plan, i.e. to reduce by two units in October-November. As you mentioned, the next step is for the Secretary of State to put the proposal to the other members of Gen 79 and I attach a draft minute for this purpose. 
2. 
I should make two comments on the draft: a. 
CGS considers that it would be advisable to take this 
opportunity of driving home the point that we do not intend the plan to be affected by the temporary requirement for soldiers to help with prison guard duties. Hence paragraph 4. 
b. Although Mr Whitelaw makes no mention in his minute of 
any preference for how early or late the units should be informed, at Friday’s NIOM Mr Cooper said that NIO saw advantage in telling the units become public - 
- and thus letting the news as early as practicable. Paragraph 5 of the 
draft reflects this view, which is of course in line with what we ourselves would prefer.

DRAFT MINUTE FROM SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE PRIME MINISTER You will recall that at the Gen 79 meeting held on 12th July the 
the CGS and I expressed our concern about the effect on the Army of maintaining the existing Northern Ireland force level. We explained the cumulative severity of the penalties involved; and we described how we hoped that it would be possible for the present level of 18 Major units in the infantry role to be reduced to 16 during the autumn, to 14 by the end of December and to 12 by about next Easter. The Committee fully accepted the case for such reductions and agreed that we should begin to plan for them, but that complete secrecy must be maintained for the time being and there should be further consultation in September before any action was taken which might become public. 2. 
We have now re-examined the matter. I am in no doubt that the 
penalties of maintaining the present force level are still as serious ry as they appeared in July and will become increasingly so. From this point of view, the argument for seeking a reduction is no less strong. Meanwhile the intense pressure maintained by the Security Forces against the terrorists since Operation Motorman has clearly brought about a considerable improvement in the security situation. The pressure must be maintained but, for the reasons to which I have referred, I am anxious not to keep the force level any higher than is strictly necessary for the task.

Implementation of the planned reductions would in no way affect the availability of units in Britain and in Germany to reinforce Northern Ireland at short notice: experience has shown that it helps to keep the temperature down, as well as to lesser turbulence for the Army, if the reserves are held in Br i t a i n and Ge rmany rather than on t h i s sort.

1. LM to Encl 2 to A/BB/20/M04 dated 7 Aug 73 Thank you for your minute at reference A enclosing a paper by HQ 
Northern Ireland. 2. 
We think that any subsequent papers on this subject should include an 
indication of the cost of the proposals. We will be prepared to co-ordinate the costing work but will require more details (eg numbers of regular military personnel, CONRATES, UDR personnel and civilians) before setting it in hand. It is suggested that it may be necessary to present the costs in two ways - first the variation on current LTC provision, which will probably show a saving in running costs but additional capital expenditure, and secondly the increase over the cost of the 1968 garrison.

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND NORTHERN IRELAND FORCE LEVEL REDUCTIONS 
AUS(GS) BGS(INT) DPR(ARMY) ASD 2 M04 DS10 
You will recall that at the Gen 79 meeting held on 12th July 
the then CGS and I expressed our concern about the effect on the Army of maintaining the existing Northern Ireland force level. We explained the cumulative severity of the penalties involved; and we described how we hoped that it would be possible for the present level of 18 major units in the infantry role to be reduced to 16 during the autumn, to 14 by the end of December and to 12 by about next Easter. The Committee fully accepted the case for such reductions and agreed that we should begin to plan for them, but that complete secrecy must be maintained for the time being and there should be further consultation in September before any action was taken which might become public. 
We have now re-examined the matter. I am in no doubt that 
the penalties of maintaining the present force level are still as serious as they appeared in July and will become increasingly so. From this point of view, the argument for seeking a reduction is no less strong. Meanwhile the intense pressure maintained by the security forces against the terrorists since Operation Motorman has clearly brought about a considerable improvement in the security situation and I am advised that, in the cities at least, an increasing proportion of such trouble as continues to occur is essentially criminal in its nature and requires a police as much as a military approach. I fully appreciate that the RUC is still heavily dependent on the Army and will remain so for some time to come - though I hope that the steps which you are taking to strengthen its leadership will begin to have a positive effect quite soon. I hope too that the extra regiment of RMP now being formed will help very substantially to reinforce the RUC’s capability. 
None of this means that I have any illusions about the readi- 
ness of the various extremist groups to rebuild their strength if the pressure on them were reduced radically in the short term. My point is simply that, for the reasons I have mentioned, I am most reluctant to keep the force level any higher than is necessary.

The chairman defined the objects of the meeting, which were to: a. 
Confirm the arrangements for Phase 1 of the reduction 
in force level (from 18 to 16 major units in the infantry role) on the assumption it would be approved by GEN 79. 
Establish guidelines for Phases 2 and 3 of the reduction (from 16 - 14 and 14 - 12 major units in the infantry role 
b. 
respectively). c. 
Determine the company strengths of roulement units in the infantry role at each force level. 
2. b The chairman then outlined the programme for the reduction 
of the force level laid down by the CGS, noting how HQ Northern Ireland’s detailed proposals differed:

NORTHERN IRELAND FORCE LEVEL REDUCTIONS 
Reference: A. Gen 79(73) 8th Meeting Minutes dated 13 July 1973. B. CGS/1180 dated 16 August 1973. 
1. Background. You will recall that at the Gen 79 meeting 
(Reference A) on 12 July 1973 my predecessor proposed a timetable for cutting back the force level in Northern Ireland, in steps of 2 units at a time, to the following pattern: 
a. b. c. October-November 73 
By Christmas By 1 April 74 
- reduce to 16 - reduce to 14 - reduce to 12 
During my recent visit to Northern Ireland, (Reference B), I discussed these reductions with the GOC, who has since put forward his own proposals for the first stage of the rundown. I now seek your formal approval to reduce the Northern Ireland force level by 2 units in October/November 73. 
2. Reduction of 2 Units. The GOC proposes to reduce the 
military presence in the mainly Protestant areas of East and South Belfast. Although this will involve some risks, the GOC and I believe that they must be accepted. I therefore intend to stand down: 
a. 7 Para RHA (from UKLF), who were due to deploy 
25-27 October. b. 
32 Engr Regt (from BAOR), due to deploy 28-30 November.

PEACETIME STRUCTURE FOR THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND Reference: Encl 2 to A/BR/20/M04 dated 7 Aug 73. 
1. We think that subsequent papers on the peacetime structure for the Army in Northern Ireland should include a section on the requirement for civilian staff. The total civilian strength is at present about 800 non-industrials and 2100 industrials with attempts to recruit a further 200 industrials in progress. Clearly a force level of the kind which you are contemplating would involve substantial reductions. It is important for both Army Department Planning Guidelines and civil management purposes that an estimate of the future requirement should be provided. 
2. 3. Similarly, although not of direct concern to IE(A), we suggest that the 
probable reduction in CONRATE officers and soldiers, which would result fr the UDR contraction, should be stated. 
Finally, VT & CF, CM(A)l General and CM(Ind)2b should be included on the distribution of subsequent papers. W G MANN
