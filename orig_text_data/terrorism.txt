Annex A to A/BR/30/1/M04 Dated 25 October 1972 
HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING 25 OCTOBER 1972 
BACKGROUND 1. 
General. The week was relatively quiet and saw the cessation of Protestant 
inspired violence. 2. 
IRA Activity. Provisional IRA activity in Belfast and Londonderry has 
remained at a relatively low level with a total of 158 shooting incidents and 20 explosions. Londonderry continues to suffer hooligan activity with the Security Forces the main target. There has been no increase in border or rural activity although in one serious incident one UDR soldier was killed and another, his brother, injured. The soldier seriously injured in the booby-trapped house in Armagh died on 24 October, and another soldier was shot dead in a single shot sniping incident in the Falls. There have been further indications that the Provisionals are losing support. Andersonstown,once the hardest area in the City has been progressively quieter since Operation Motorman. Residents of a number of housing estates there have reportedly expressed their wish for the IRA to end hostilities and the local IRA battalion is known to be thoroughly disorganised. There are indications that the Provisional IRA in Belfast is suffering from lack of effective leadership; Seamus Twomey may be in the Republic and the continued SF domination seriously restricts IRA command and control. In Londonderry, where there continue to be conflicting reports of IRA undergoing training in nearby County Donegal, the Provisionals issued a statement on 18 October warning that anyone in the city "found collaborating with the RUC or the Army verbally or otherwise would be executed accordingly". 
3. Protestant Activity. Evidence that the UDA, whilst attempting to conceal the 
part they played in the violence of the previous week, were in fact encouraging it, was highlighted during the week. William Craig’s "shoot and kill" outburst offended moderates but regrettably attracted Vanguard and UDA rank and file support. After a meeting between UDA and senior Army officers on 18 October the UDA issued instructions ordering the abeyance of further confrontations with the Army. This order seems to have been largely obeyed although UDA patrol presence has not diminished. Sectarian attacks have however continued, spreading from the city to the country. Realising the greater difficulty in protecting isolated targets ’midnight marauders’ burnt Catholic-owned haysheds, a church, a church hall and two schools in the countryside. Perhaps the most significant and, from all the available evidence, extreme Protestant activity of the week was the theft of weapons from the Lurgan TAVR Centre in the early hours of 23 October. In this raid 104 weapons were stolen, of which 69 were recovered within four hours. Vanguard Headquarters is thought to be planning a number of courses of action designed to disrupt the local Government elections. The Loyalist Defence Volunteers declared that the "loyal British people of Ulster would not tolerate the imposition of the Proportional Representation system of voting". 
4. Security Force Activity. Troops redeployed during last week’s Protestant 
rioting have returned to the hard IRA areas and the week has been fairly quiet though tense. There has been no reduction in force levels and selective anti-terrorist operations have continued, including finds of 24 weapons and arrests of 13 IRA officers.

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING 18 OCTOBER 1972 
1. General. 
Defence Association (UDA) were about to mount coordinated attacks on Catholic properties located in predominantly Protestant areas. 
Throughout the week there were persistent rumours that the Ulster These rumours were supported 
when during Wednesday night UDA and Tartan gangs rampaged in the Shankill and .East Belfast. 
(SF) to recapture ’Gusty Spence’ an escaped murderer and acknowledged UVF leader. 59 Protestant arrests were made but subsequently all were released. 
There was only one serious SF casualty and it is likely that the reaction was instinctive rather than contrived. on Sunday night and has continued each night since. 
Major rioting followed an operation mounted by the Security Forces During the 
same night there were at least 18 separate incidents of fire being directed at SF from within Protestant areas. 
Though the following 
night was less active intersectarian incidents continued according to the expected pattern. 
Extreme Protestant activity both anti-Catholic and anti-SF occurred After renewed rioting in East 
Belfast and the Shankill on Monday night in which there were at least 40 Protestant shooting incidents at SF, the UDA issued a statement calling on all Loyalists to withdraw cooperation from the Army and the Whitelaw administration ".......to hell with the British Ary, to hell with the Whitelaw administration. Ary and the British Government are now our enemies". 
The British On Tuesday night there was 
no let-up and Protestant terrorists engaged SF in over 50 shooting incidents unprovoked either by IRA or SF. 
IRA shooting incidents and bomb attacks. 
Meanwhile there has been a slight decrease in Despite this overall decrease there 
were a number of serious IRA incidents including a brutal attack on a Catholic magistrate renowned for his firm attitude towards terrorism. For different reasons both Republican and Protestant extremists now seem united in their opposition to the local government elections on 6 December. 
Six Provisional Officers were 
arrested including the OC of the Newry Provisional Company; the operations officer of the 1st Belfast Bn and two of those believed to be involved in the murders of CSgt Ruddy (UDR, brutally murdered last week); and Spr Stewart (shot in the Four Square Laundry incident). 
2. Protestant Activities. 
the week which included the first sustained shooting attacks by extreme Protestants against SF since Internment Week. 
on Catholic properties, including three churches, continued. Extremist Tartan 
gang activity took place on the Sunday and Monday nights, both nights beginning with attacks on Catholic properties but becoming entirely anti-SF when the Army intervened. 
Information that UVF leaders, including Gusty Spence, were meeting 
on Wednesday evening in a Shankill Club led to the temporary arrest of 59 Protestants. On Tuesday the UDA in Londonderry claimed responsibility for destroying a fertiliser factory, an alleged source of IRA explosives, across the border in the Republic. A car bomb exploded in Clones (in the Republic) seriously injuring one man; there are indications that this may also have been planted by extreme Protestants. 
Extreme Protestant violence has dominated events during Attempted assassinations and incendiary attacks

3. IRA Activity. Reports continue to indicate that Provisional morale is low 
and that they have found it increasingly difficult to operate due to SF domination. They have been further hampered by selective arrests and subsequent detention of senior officers the most important of which was Cornelius McHugh, the Operations Officer of the 1st Battalion in Belfast. 
Though IRA activities have to some 
extent been reduced during the week reports of a forthcoming intesification of the sniping campaign have been received. 
4. Security Force Activity. The main feature of the week has been the 
contingency deployment of troops out of IRA dominated areas into Protestant areas. On three occasions during the week up to three company-sized groups were redeployed to deal with Tartan rioting either in the Shankill or East Belfast. 
The week has 
seen some excellent finds including 74 weapons. 5. 
Propaganda. 
into the Republic, the UDA propaganda effort has been maintained and even increased. A determined effort has been made to get the UDA into the headlines daily. 
Following last week’s claim of a successful raid over the border They 
have published a booklet attacking 1 PARA over the incidents in the Shankill Road in early September; they have even forecast that British troops will "run amok" in Protestant areas. 
from Vietnam as instructors in guerilla warfare. 
They have also stated that they are using US Army veterans The deaths of two Protestants 
on Monday night provided a propaganda platform from which the UDA are attempting to alienate the Protestant community from SF and Government. 
In comparison 
the propaganda efforts of Republicans have been slight and only appeared in the Republican orientated press.

A Catholic magistrate was shot 
and seriously wounded (probably by the Provisional IRA) as he delivered his children to school on Wednesday, and a Catholic youth, who had a Protestant girlfriend was found murdered in East Belfast on the same day. 
Early on Saturday 
the Headquarters of 10 UDR, off the Lisburn Road, was raided and five self-loading rifles and seven loaded magazines were taken. Protestants were responsible. 
Indications are that extreme Incidents during the week included the attempted 
murder of a Resident Magistrate, a successful booby-trap attack in a house in Armagh, and the shooting of an RUC constable on foot patrol in Belfast.

The paper would go to Cabinet on 17 October and (barring accidents)/published on 30 October. It would not be called a discussion". 
but a "paper for 
(ii) The Diplock Commission Names of the 3 members serving on the Commission would be announced shortly. 
(iii) Tribunals 
Four chairmen had been appointed. It would be unwise to appoint laymen to the tribunals in view of the assassination attempt on Mr Staunton. 
2. Border Security 
Ministers had decided not to resume cratering on the border. The Army had been asked to do a study of the increased use of ramps. This would be included in the study on border security to be undertaken by Lt Col Nevill. 
3. Protestant Extremists 
The risk of militant Protestant activity over the coming weekend was discussed, and in particular the danger of the UVF operating under the cover of UDA offers of assistance to the Army in controlling Tartans. It was agreed that the Secretary of State should be alerted to the risks of Protestant activity over the weekend. 
The next NIOM will be held at noon on Tuestay 17 October in Conference Room "B". The meeting on Friday 20 October will be held in Room 35 (on the same floor). Present:

OUTLOOK 
4. Reiorts have been received that militant Protestant activity is likely to escalate at the weekend. Details are not available but it will probably take the form of that of the 11 October 1972. Continuing Protestant activity may then spread to Rural areas durin the coming week. 
5. If Protestant violence-is aimed against Catholic people or pronerty, then 6i 
the Provisional IRA will enage in a counter reaction in their ; sned capacity as defenders of the minority. The Provisionals can be expected to continue their campaign against the Security Forces along much the same lines 
as in recent weeks. 6.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 060700 HOURS TO 090700 HOURS OCTOBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
The weekends violence followed the usual pattern of a more active 
Friday with quieter Saturday and Sunday. However there were less shooting incidents (77) than in recent weekends (130 last weekend). On the other hand there were 12 bombings compared with 7 last weekend causing 1 civilian killed and 16 injured. Another bomb in the Lower Falls had the appearance of a Protestant attack. Several useful arrests were made and there were 6 hits on terrorists (including 1 killed). The Civil Rights anniversary rally in Londonderry passed off uneventfully but later minor stoning and hooliganism took place. There were several incidents of UDR weapons being stolen and one UDR man was abducted temporarily. 
2. During Fri/Sat (6/7 Oct). There was an increase in shooting incidents 
(35) in Belfast and one gunman was shot dead. There were no SF casualties but 2 other hits were claimed. An explosion caused extensive damage to a Youth Club in Mullhouse St (Falls). 
number of arrests were made including 
2 officers and 4 volunteers of the Provisional IRA. Londonderry was extremely quiet; there were no shooting incidents and only sporadic stoning in the Shantallow area. A 150 lb bomb caused extensive damage in Ballymena. A UDR soldier was abducted in Newry and in 3 separate incidents, other UDR soldiers were robbed of a total of 3 rifles, a shotgun, an SMG and ammunition, a 9mm pistol and an air rifle. UDA members were active in Lurgan and Lisburn. 
3. During Sat/Sun (7/8 Oct). 
dropped to 13 but an explosion in Leeson St (Falls) killed a 22 year old woman and injured 14 other civilians 
The number of shooting incidents in Belfast a 9 year old girl is VSI. There was 
increased hooliganism by Protestant youths in E Belfast. Londonderry had another quiet day though a soldier was wounded in one of the two shooting incidents in the Bogside. 
A Protestant youth (20) was shot dead in Newtown 
Stewart by a UDR patrol, after a bombing incident. 15 shots were fired at a SF patrol on Armagh and 5 rounds were returned; there were no casualties. There were 3 explosions in the rural area.

NOTE OF A MEETING AT NOON ON 6 OCTOBER 1972 1. The Chairman reported the general conclusions reached by Ministers that morn- 
ing on the timing of possible political developments and other matters, and said that work in the Northern Ireland Office on the setting up of tribunals and the Diplock Commission was proceeding urgently. 
2. The meeting discussed the possibility that the Sunday Times Insight team might 
publish an article on the use of patrols in plain clothes by the Army. The information services have been working hard on countering IRA propaganda about "assassination squads" by making the facts available to the press. The line should be taken that it is natural and essential for the security forces to have recourse to patrols in plain clothes. If an unreasonable article did, appear this Sunday, it was possible that a reply might be delivered in a major speech. 
3. Although there has been little change in the security situation, two dangers 
in particular remain: that Provisionals who have been in the Republic will step up their activity in Northern Ireland; and that Protestant extremists will grow in strength. Any information about the Provisionals in the Republic which could be passed to the authorities there for action should be sent to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 
4. The next meetings are due to take place at noon on 10 and 13 October in Conference Room B.

A/R/30/1/M04 dated 4 October 1972. Headquarters Northern Ireland weekly operational summary for the week 
ending 4 October 1972 was circulated under Reference A. An updating of the summary up to 0800 hrs Friday 6 October is attached at Annex A. 
The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. The weekly intelligence report as at 6 October 1972 has been issued 
separately. OUTLOOK 4. 
October 1972 6 OCTOBER 1972 01-930-7022 Ext 7876 Provisional IRA activity may be expected to continue to comprise mainly of 
sniping attacks against the Security Forces in Belfast and the rural areas, and attempts to mine Security Force vehicles in the country. In border areas, while the Provisional IRA are able to mount raids from the Republic, continuing attacks must be expected particularly around Strabane, Clady and Castlederg. 
5. The Official IRA are likely to continue to place their main emphasis on 
political activities in preparation for the forthcoming local government elections: they are likely to increase their propaganda activity designed to ensure the removal of the proscription of Republican Clubs in order that their candidates may stand as representatives of this political grouping. The forthcoming Official Republican sponsored rallies in Londonderry are likely to be well attended and act as a focus for political attack. 
6. 7. The likelihood for further interfactional incidents remains. Any interference 
by the Security Forces will result in fire from both groups being directed onto the soldiers. 
There continues to be divergent views amongst Protestant extremists as to 
what their future activities should be, particularly as Darlington has not given them a focus for opposition. The possibility exists of increased emphasis on attacks on suspected IRA members or premises.

UPDATING POINTS FOR HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY AS AT FRIDAY 6 OCTOBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
The rise in IRA activity shows signs of continuing. There were 13 
bomb incidents and 48 shootings, one of which was an attempt on the life of Mr Craig. 
CASUALTIES 2. MIL - 
9 injured (2 VSI) 
CIV - 2 killed (intersectarian) - IRA - 2 hits claimed. 
ARRESTS 3. 
FINDS 4. 
6 injured (1 intersectarian) Only routine ones made, except James TRAINOR (Adjt A Coy 3 Bn Provo). Some 8 weapons, assorted ammunition and explosive. 
IRA ACTIVITY 5. 
A bomb went off without warning in a Catholic Bar killing one and wounding 
several. 13 bomb attacks were spread throughout the Province but shootings mainly confined to city areas, though there were a couple of cross border shooting incidents. 
6. 7. An explosion successfully ut off electrical power to most of County 
Fermanagh. This is the first really successful ’black out’ resulting from many attacks on the supply system during the last year. 
Intimidation against individual members of the Press continues. 
PROTESTANT ACTIVITY 8. 
Credence to reports of Protestant attacks on isolated Catholic families 
living in Protestant areas are strengthened by the murder of a young Catholic at his home in Portadown. A grenade is believed to have been thrown through the window. 
9. Parties of UDA called on householders in Lisburn and ordered them to 
handover their PR voting forms which they then tore up. The UDA were masked and cudgelled. 
10. Overt UDA activity continues in East Belfast. An MRF vehicle was forcibly stopped by a group of UDA on the Newtonards Road at 0105 hrs 5 Oct. One soldier is VSI with compound skull fractures resulting from a brick being thrown through the windscreen. His pistol was stolen.

5. Political, With representatives of the NILP and SDLP at the Labour Party 
Conference in Blackpool, the disagreements between the parties are likely to be given another airing and to this end Mrs Shirley Williams, formerly Minister of State for Northern Ireland in the Home Office, has proposed an emergency debate on Northern Ireland, Mr Wilson’s statement on unity in 15 years and the withdrawal of licensed firearms has produced a strong reaction amongst Protestants. John flume stated on Monday that Northern Ireland, as a political unit, was inherently unstable and that to find within it a basis for stability was simply impossible, On the other hand Dr Connor Cruise O’Brien replying to Mr Hume’s belief that the 1920 Government of Ireland Act is the source of Northern Ireland’s major ills, said that even to suggest unity is to destroy hopes of peace. 
6. Propaganda. By the end of September anti-Army propaganda generated by 
Republican sources had reached the highest level so far since the introduction of direct rule. The reason may be a sense of political isolation and signs of an increasing, slow but sure, pressure exerted against the IRA by the Catholic population. Current themes now includes 
a. Allegations that Security Forces are acting in conjunction with the UDA in order to terrorise Catholics into accepting an imposed political solution. 
b. A campaign against Army plain clothes patrols designed to deprive us of an important tactical advantage. Allegations are made in such a way as to link these patrols with unsolved murders. 
Continued reference to harassment in Catholic areas, brutality 
towards those taken into custody for questioning and unlawful shooting at ’innocent’ civilians. 
d. Continued efforts are being made to discredit all our statements and to blame any publicity unfavourable to the IRA on to what they term "Army black propaganda". 
7. The emphasis of Republican propaganda is on discrediting authority, whereas a 
year ago attempts were made to glorify the IRA as well. The extreme Protestants remain quiet on the propaganda front, at least so far as the Army is concerned. 
8. The Falls Gunbattle. On 24 September The Garrick Social Club, a meeting 
place frequented by both factions of the IRA, was bombed causing one Provisional death and 29 injuries, many of whom are likely to have been sympathisers of the Officials. The funeral which followed on 29 September became the catalyst for a serious gunbattle in which up to 3000 rounds were exchanged, two terrorists (one a woman) and one soldier were killed and at least seven other terrorists and bystanders were hit. Although the cause of this outbreak remains in doubt it is likely to have been initially the result of increasing interfactional tension, and the Security Forces only becoming involved after they had shot dead one of the Official IRA gunmen. The battle continued until the evening when the Security Forces withdrew. During the engagement a total of 28 vehicles including six buses were hijacked, 13 of which were burnt out.

killed a member of a plain clothes surveillance team posing as the driver of a sundry delivery van. This patrol was part of a most successful intelligence gathering operation which had, over the past few months, provided information which had been responsible for, either directly or indirectly, over 30% of the arrests of Provisional IRA officers in the Andersonstown area. A WRAC member of the patrol escaped unhurt. The IRA simultaneously raided a home which they believed to be the Headquarters of this unit. The Four Square Laundry Service, as it was called, has now been withdrawn. It was, incidentally, a popular laundry service offering good service at cut rates. 
Incident in Andersontown. On 2 October the Provisional IRA ambushed and 
10. Sectarian Murders. These have continued at an average of one a day. Because of the impenetrable wall of silence which surrounds them the CID find most of their enquiries fruitless so that it is difficult to determine which are truly sectarian and which are the settling of old scores for other reasons. 
11. Bombs. During the week there were 15 explosions in the City amongst which were two particularly significant car bombs. The first, a 100 lb device, exploded outside the James Connelly Club killing ex detainee Patrick McKee, a Volunteer in the Provisional IRA. Whether planted by extreme Protestants or intended to exacerbate interfactional differences may never be known. The second car bomb loaded with approximately 200 lbs, exploded in Marlborough Street. Significantly, Security Forces arrested yet another recently released internee as he was seen to run away after getting out of the car. A further illustration of IRA ingenuity was the hiding of 200 lbs of explosive in a settee which was then delivered to a furniture warehouse by bombers posing as workmen. 
LONDONDERRY 
12. The city has remained quiet during the week with only 23 shooting incidents in which one soldier was very seriously injured and in another an RUC constable was slightly wounded. Although 9 bombs were found and defused there were only 4 explosions in the city, one of which was a device in the region of 600 lbs. Hooliganism in the form of stoning and bottling of patrols was considerably reduced compared to the previous week and at a ’Prayer for Peace’ meeting 1500 people were exhorted to keep the children off the streets. 
RURAL AND BORDER AREAS 
13. Rural. Security Forces have been fired on in rural towns notably Portadown, Armagh, Coalisland and Maghera but there has been no inordinate increase in terrorist activity. On 27 September a 100 lb bomb destroyed Armagh City Hall and others damaged premises in Armagh, Newry, Dungiven and Portadown. There have also been a number of minor stoning incidents in Armagh and several anti-Catholic hooligan attacks in Bangor. 
14. Cross Border Activity. In addition to continued attacks on electricity pylons, the most significant event was the IRA raid into Castlederg on 29 September. This raid, following so soon after the incident reported last week, in which a UDR soldier and his wife were murdered in their home on the Border, illustrates how easy it is for the terrorist to mount his activities from the Republic. 
OUTLOOK 
15. Provisionals may be expected to continue sniping attacks against the Security Forces in Belfast and the rural areas, and to continue to attempt to mine Security Force vehicles in the country. Although the rate may be raised in response to further Security Force successes, it is unlikely that the Provisionals have the capability in Belfast (given the reportedly weak state of the 1st/3rd Battalions) to sustain a much increased level of activity. In Londonderry, however, following the reported return of leading Provisionals from the Republic, an increase in activity may be expected.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 290700HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 to 020700 HOURS OCTOBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
The level of violence was higher than previous weekends over the last two 
months. On Fri/Sat there were 50 shootings and two explosions, on Sat/Sun 53 shooting incidents and 4 explosions. On Sun/Mon 27 shootings and one explosion. Casualties totaled 2 soldiers killed and 3 wounded ( 1 x VSI); 6 RUC wounded; 18 terrorists claimed hit, and 5 civilians killed and 30 wounded. Most of the trouble was in Belfast with Londonderry and the Rural areas relatively quiet. The major violence was in the Lower Falls area which continued throughout Friday afternoon and evening and seems to have been started by Provisional action against the Officials-this being a predominately Official area. The bombing of a Catholic club, perhaps by Provisionals, and a funeral procession were the main cause and apportunity for the serious violence between the factions and against Security Forces. 
This 
developed on Saturday into attacks on Security Force posts mainly in the Falls, but died away during the late evening with Sunday being mainly quiet. Meanwhile the Vanguard rally passed off without violence. ZU3 estimates of the attendance were 15000 including a parade of UDA members some wearing masks and carrying cudgels. 
Prayers for Peace meetings took place throughout the province. In Strasbourg it is reported that the European Commission for Human Rights has accepted the admissibility of the Irish Governments’ charges relating to interrogation and internment.

NORTHERN IRELAND - WEEKLY OPSUM AND OUTLOOK - 29 SEPTEMBER 1972 Reference: A: A/BR/30/1/M04 dated 27 September 1972. 
1. Headquarters Northern Ireland weekly operational summary for the week ending 27 September 1972 was circulated under Reference A. An updating of the summary up to 0800 hrs Friday 29 September is attached at Annex A. 
2. The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. 
3. The weekly intelligence report as at 29 September 1972 has been issued separately. OUTLOOK 
4. Provisional IRA activity can be expected to continue at the present low level in Belfast where there are indications that 2 of the 3 battalions are very demoralised. The level of activity in rural areas may escalate as terrorists increasingly seek softer targets: reports that the Provisional IRA are planning to increase their attacks against the security forces in country areas have been received. In Londonderry City an increase in the level of terrorist activity may be expected following the return of Provisional leaders. 
5. The Official IRA seem likely to maintain their truce for the present, especially while they continue to benefit from their rival’s setbacks. However, there is an increasing likelihood of interfactional strife as the Provisionals become more aware of their diminishing position. 
6. Militant extreme Protestant action continues to offer a serious threat to security, particularly in the field of sectarian murders. It is probable that it will not be until there is some indication of the outcome of the Darlington talks that Protestant organisations will decide their line of action. The theme of the Vanguard rally on 30 September 1972 has yet to be determined, however, there is no intelligence that the occasion is intended to provoke trouble, but this is always a possiblity on dispersal, particularly at the interfaces in East Belfast.

Annex A to A/BR/30/1/M04 Dated 
HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 27 SEPTEMBER 1972 
INTRODUCTION 1. 
General. The week began with a feeling of apprehension over the increasing 
viciousness of attacks and anticipation of some dramatic incident arranged by any of the opposing extremist factions to demonstrate their power before the Constitutional Conference in Darlington. No attempt to influence the Conference materialised and the week has been quiet in urban areas though the Border continues to be the scene of ruthless terrorist activity, some of which was mounted from the Republic. In the Crossmaglen area a skilful ambush was mounted which led to the death of an Army officer and the wounding of one soldier and two policemen. Shooting incidents and bomb attacks remain at much the same level as the previous period though there has been an increase in incendiary devices planted, most of which have been discovered before detonation. The recovery during the period of 41 weapons and 6,844 rounds of ammunition (making an overall total since Op MOTORMAN was launched of over 380 weapons and 55,000 rounds of ammunition) is an indication not only of Security Forces success but also of the number and variety of weapons available to the terrorist. Forensic tests have proved at least 377 different weapons are currently in use in Belfast and this is probably well under half the number at present available to the Provisionals. The level of UDA militant activity has been low, though a number of bombs, most of which failed to ignite properly, were almost certainly the work of extreme Protestants. 
2. IRA Activity. Though the Russell Court Hotel bombing on 25 September was 
no doubt intended to remind those whose eyes are turned towards Darlington that the real power lies with the Provisionals, IRA terrorism has remained surprisingly low. Their morale is reported to be affected by continuing military domination and by interfactional, dialectic disputes. As the Provisionals in Belfast continue to be rounded up by the Security Forces the influence of the Officials is increasing. 
3. Extreme Protestant Activity. This heading is used because the dividing 
line between the activities of the militant UDA and the UVF is becoming increasingly ill-defined. There has been some local Protestant uneasiness at the activities of militant Protestant forces and, after six months of Direct Rule, there are clear indications of increasing sectarian strife, eg, the overt appearance of over 50 uniformed UVF at the funeral in Larne of a publicly acknowledged UVF member. UVF bombs have been planted during the week including an attempt to destroy a L 1/4 million Catholic Church and an attack on a Republican Social Club in Belfast. UDA patrols of Protestant areas have appeared daily throughout the Province and some of these, notably in Lisburn and Belfast, have been masked and armed with cudgels. In two incidents patrols were found in possession of pistols and arrests were made. 
4. Security Forces Activity. As information becomes increasingly available 
so the attrition of IRA resolve progresses. Weapon finds and arrests of IRA officers and volunteers have been responsible for the deterioration in the morale and effectiveness of two of the Provisional IRA battalions in Belfast. As the days get shorter our relatively much better night fighting capability will be to our advantage. Over 117,000 cars were checked during the period and some successful arrests coupled with patrolling throughout the Rural areas appear to have again forced the terrorist to operate from the Republic, flitting across the border to lay mines and shooting at the Security Forces. In Belfast continued progress has been made in establishing the acceptance of RMP/RUC patrols in the Ardoyne, Garnock

Hill and Springfield Road areas. In Londonderry, patrols report a reasonable reception from the locals although some children and the Derry Young Hooligans present an increasing nuisance factor. WRAC (Provost) are being used to search 
women in both cities. 5. 
Political. 
BELFAST 6. 
The Whitelaw Conference continues in Darlington at the time of 
writing. The SDLP declined to take part and the parties represented are the Unionist, Alliance and Northern Ireland Labour Party. 
The level of terrorist activity has remained relatively low each week 
throughout the month. However, following the arrest by Security Forces of Eddie Campbell (a Provisional Battalion Commander) on 20 September 1972, disturbances in the Ardoyne resulted in a gunman being shot dead and a second wounded. The incidence of both sniping and bombing attacks has been low. Despite considerable damage to the £21/2 million Russell Court Hotel no-one was seriously injured. However in one of three Protestant bombs planted outside a Republican Social Club beside Unity Flats, 29 civilians were injured one very seriously. No warning was given. No bombs were planted inside the Operation Segment area, the City Centre zone closely controlled by the Security Forces. On 24 September an antiinternment rally in Andersonstown attracted 2,000 protestors, a high attendance for this type of event in recent months. The UDA has continued to patrol in Belfast, particularly in the areas to the South of Andersonstown, and there has been some hardening in their attitude towards the Security Forces, particularly in their refusal to discard cudgels and masks. Two soldiers died of wounds during the week. 
LONDONDERRY 7. 
In the City there has beer an increase in the pattern of deliberate harrassment 
of Security Force patrols by children operating in sizeable groups. Shooting incidents remain at a low level and, although casualties are fewer than last week, one soldier has died from gunshot wounds. Constant checks of vehicles and pedestrian movement including the searching of females by the newly introduced WRAC (Provost) have reduced bomb attacks. Disturbances followed the arrest of Charles McSheffrey (OC Londonderry City Provisional IRA) on 22 September 1972, but these were short-lived due to speedy military intervention. McSheffrey has been charged for possession of an Armalite. Press reports, backed up by statements from John Hume MP indicate that the five ’Movement for Peace’ women have been subject to verbal and physical intimidation. There has been little Protestant activity in the Waterside though two masked UDA patrols dispersed and removed their masks when told to do so by the Security Forces. 
RURAL AND BORDER AREAS 8. 
The recent increase in bomb attacks in the rural and border areas has been 
maintained. Pylons, commercial premises and the Security Forces remain the principal targets. On 21 September 1972 an officer was shot dead and a soldier wounded whilst investigating a bomb on the border near Crossmaglen. Two RUC constables were ambushed and wounded whilst searching, with the Gardai, for a rifle lost in the previous incident. On the same day, a group of IRA thugs from the Republic attacked three UDR families close to the Fermanagh border, brutally murdering a private and his wife, and rapidly re-crossed the border cheering and blowing their motor horns. The level of activity in Strabane has slightly decreased during the last seven days but it still remains the most active area of the border. Besides sporadic shooting incidents the nearby Customs Post was blown up on 23 September 1972 and hooligans have roamed the streets of the town. Militant Loyalist activity has reduced, though the UDA have been in evidence in Larne, Carrickfergus, Greenisland and Lisburn. Portadown has not featured so

significantly during the week and there has been less intersectarian activity 
there than in the last three weeks. PROPAGANDA 
9. As a preliminary to the opening of the Eire Government’s case against HMG at the European Commission of Human Rights at Strasbourg, the Republican propagandists have taken the opportunity to reiterate old allegations of torture and brutality, some dating from a year ago. The Provisionals have continued with their current campaign of allegations of harrassment, brutality and atrocity whenever a suitable incident has arisen. 
10. Accusations of brutality at Long Kesh have increased and have now become a continuing theme. The propaganda campaign begun by the UDA has now died away and little has been heard from them during the week. 
OUTLOOK 
11. There are indications that the Provisional IRA, particularly two of the Belfast battalions, are becoming increasingly isolated from Catholic support and demoralised by Security Force domination. However as long as Sean Stepheson continues at the helm, there is little doubt that they will continue to pursue a campaign of violence as long as they have the will and the capability. The Official Republican Movement will continue to gain from Provisional failures and will continue to exert its influence in the Provisional areas of Belfast. Militant extreme Protestant action continues to offer a serious threat to security. It is probable that Protestant organisations will decide their line of action after there is some indication of the progress being made at the Darlington talks.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 220700 to 250700 HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 
GENERAL The level of violence again showed no increase over previous weekends. 
On Fri/Sat there were 30 shootings and one confirmed explosion, on Sat/Sun 39 shootings 3 explosions and one border mine; and on Sun/Mon 25 shootings and 5 explosions. Casualties totaled one officer killed and four soldiers wounded (3 x VSI); three RUC wounded (1x VSI); eleven terrorists claimed hit, all in Catholic areas; and one civilian killed and one wounded. The principal events of the weekend were a serious border incident and the arrest of two prominent Provisionals on Fri/Sat; some intersectarian trouble in East BELFAST and the City Centre on Sat/Sun; and an anti-internment rally attended by 2000 in Andersonstown on Sunday, which passed with little incident. GB weekend press comment concentrated on the DARLINGTON talks, which begin today. The Observer carried an important article by Conor Cruise O’Brien. Elsewhere the European Human Rights Commission meets today in Strasbourg (in camera) to judge the admissibility of the Irish Republics’ case calling for an investigation of alleged brutality resulting from interrogation. In the Republic, the Justice Minister warned of ’tough and immediate measures to stamp out IRA terrorism after the recent trouble in DUNDALK. 
2. During Fri/Sat (22/23 Sep 72). There were 30 shooting incidents, 25 of which involved the SF who claimed one hit. In an incident on the border near Crossmaglen, Co Armagh, an officer of 1 A & SH was fatally wounded and a private of 1 A & SH and two RUC constables were wounded. One of the constables is critically ill. A separate report is at Annex A. Gdsm Fee of 2 SG was wounded in the neck and shoulder in Londonderry and is VSI. A subsequent follow up resulted in an Armalite being recovered. The body of a man (RC) was found in Belfast. There were no other military or civilian casualties. In Londonderry two men were captured with an Armalite one of whom was 
who 
was number 2 on the wanted list of IRA leaders in Londonderry. The customs caravan at Strabane was blown up and an explosion was heard in the Sion Mills area, but there were no other explosions during the period.

f. Suffolk. A bomb was found behind the CESA Club in Glen Road, it 
was exploded by ATO. No damage or casualties. It is thought that a Mr William DUFFY, a customs officer and another man had been taken from the Whitefort Inn Andersonstown Road by the Provisional IRA on 20 Sep. Mr DUFFY was transferred from Armagh after he had witnessed an IRA murder. 
LONDONDERRY 3. 
There were four shooting incidents all involving Security Forces. 
Fire was returned twice and one hit was claimed. There was hooliganism in the Creggan and the Bogside. A soldier of 2 SG was concussed by a brick. A 30 lb bomb was planted in a garage in Strand Road by 2 men but it failed to explode. ATO disposed of the bomb. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 4. 
There were three shooting incidents. At 1830 hrs a group of gunmen 
in two cars crossed the border at Aghalane, SW of Newtownbutler and carried out attacks on UDR men. Pte BULLOCK and his wife were shot dead in their house by one car load of men. The other group of terrorists drove to another house nearby in an attempt to murder another UDR man. He was away in the fields and his wife, seeing the gunmen approach, hid with her children. However the terrorists stole his uniform, a combat jacket and two full SMG magazines. On their way back to the Republic the gunmen fired a burst at Aghalane Post Office, the house of a third UDR soldier, as they passed. There were two shooting incidents in Portadown but no casualties. Fire was returned in the second incident, and in the fol ow up subversive literature was found in the flat from where the firing came. The funeral of Edmund WOLSLEY, killed by a car bomb on 18 Sep, took place without incident. There were three armed robberies involving a total of about £150 and some liquor.

issued seperately. OUTLOOK 4. 
22 SEPTEMBER 1972 The outlook remains as for last week. As the date for the Secretary 
of State’s conference approaches so extremist groups must be expected to demonstrate their ability to influence events in the Province and thus point up their non-participation at the conference. 
5. There are indications that the Provisional IRA are becoming increasingly 
isolated and demoralised by security force domination; however, it requires only a few determined terrorists to carry out an action designed to show that without their participation the conference cannot be expected to succeed. 
6. The Official IRA will continue to gain from Provisional failures, and 
are expected to continue to try to exert their influence in the Provisional areas of Belfast.

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 20 SEPTEMBER 1972 
INTRODUCTION 1. 
General. Provisional IRA activity has continued for the 
second week at a relatively low level. Nevertheless, interfactional disturbances in LARNE at the week-end were a depressing indication of the spread of sectarianism. Other serious incidents involving Protestant extremists have occurred in BELFAST and CARRICKFERGUS. After pressure from numerous sectors the LAW strike at the two power stations was called off and though the Parachute Regiment remain persona-non-grata to the UDA, the UDA have resumed ’diplomatic relations’ with the Security Forces. The Secretary of State has decided that no undue publicity advantage should be taken of this climbdown by LAW. Other significant events during the week included the arrest of 
(gunman 
and Provisional Company Commander), the Protestant bombing of a Catholic hotel and by no means least the recovery of a large amount of arms and ammunition. 
2. Force Levels. The next three weeks will see a reduction 
of one brigade headquarters and four major units.The result of this will be that by Thursday 28 September we shall be deployed on a three brigade basis with 39 Infantry Brigade responsible for the whole of BELFAST. By 9 October 39 Infantry Brigade will have eleven battalions, 8 Infantry. Brigade six battalions, 3 Infantry Brigade three battalions, with one Province Reserve battalion in addition. This represents a reduction of one brigade headquarters and six major units since Operation Motorman began. 
3. IRA Activity. The general reduction in shooting attacks 
may well be due to IRA employment of trained snipers who are expending at least half the previous weekly totals of ammunition for twice the casualty rate achieved. On the other hand rumour has it that the younger IRA men can see the end in sight and having lined their pockets are quietly withdrawing from the ranks. The propaganda campaign continues and in two most provocative statements the Provisionals accused the military of establishing military strongpoints in two hospitals and two cathedrals and claimed ’the right of assault’. The Officials continue to consolidate their political base and there is evidence to support their claim that they are weaning support away from the Provisionals. Relations between the two factions have not improved. 
4. Protestant Activity. A number of events have confirmed 
the increasing participation of extremists in acts of terrorism normally the province of the IRA. Two men, one a UDA Company Commander, have been charged with attempted murder after a shooting incident. In LARNE petrol bombings and subsequent shooting was clearly UVF-inspired, and there is strong circumstantial evidence to indicate that Protestants planted the bomb which virtually demolished the Imperial Hotel in BELFAST on 14 September. Intelligence does not confirm Gusty Spence’s claim that the UVF has a total strength of 1,500 in BELFAST organised into 3 battalions.

5. 
and additional commitments on the Protestant front, pressure continues to be applied to the ’hard IRA’ areas. This 
Security Forces Activity. Amidst reducing force levels profile survive hilst IRA activity remains lower than for 
any period since the ceasefire; but the additional presence required with the emergence of UVF terrorism will seriously stress deployment in IRA dominated enclaves. Intelligence improves and hence arrest of key terrorists and recovery of arms parallels this progress. Since Operation MOTORMAN, over 700 persons have been arrested of which approximately 300 have been charged. Frustrations continue to occur when apparently serious offenders are released on bail rather than being held on remand. The arrest figures on Provisional Officers to date are shown below. 
6. Political. The Europa Lodge Hotel in DARLINGTON, Co 
DURHAM has been selected as the venue for next week’s constitutional conference on Northern Ireland. It now seems certain that when the Conference gets under way on Monday 25 September only the Unionist, Labour and Alliance parties will be represented. The SDLP and the DUP, though refusing to attend the Conference, are expected to publish their proposals for the future Government of Northern Ireland before the talks begin. The Derry Nationalist Party announced its intention to contest the forthcoming local government elections. It is closely aligned to the Provisional IRA. In another attempt to enter the political arena, the Provisional IRA in LONDONDERRY have formed the Derry Defence Association. Despite the merger of Vanguard, UDA and LAW clear differences of opinion exist between the leaders. 
BELFAST 7. 
Sniping and bomb attacks remain at a similar level to the 
previous period, more accurate shooting has accounted for the still high casualty figures. The most concentrated attacks occurred on 14 September after the arrest of (OC B Company 2nd Battalion Provisional IRA). The number of unexplained attacks on civilians has increased and most of these victims have beep Catholics. Following one such incident on 17 September, 
, the OC of C Company 
UDA was arrested by Security Forces and has since been charged with attempted murder. The most serious of the explosions in the city is believed to have been a Protestant bomb planted outside a Catholic owned hotel frequented by IRA. The high casualty figures (3 killed and 50 injured) was largely due to the absence of warning, unusual in IRA inspired bombs. UDA masked patrols have been more active during the week, many of them armed with cudgels. The UDA rally on 16 September passed off peacefully as did the much smaller Vanguard rally on the same day. 
3 INFANTRY BRIGADE 8. 
Shooting in the rural areas has remained sporadic with 
incidents occurring in ARMAGH, DUNGANNON and PORTADOWN, although most of the activity was confined to the border areas. A number of pylons were felled in Co TYRONE. The main DUBLIN/ BELFAST railway line was slightly damaged by an explosion 600 metres north of the border and three large mines have been defused by ATO. Other mines have exploded harmlessly elsewhere

in the Brigade area. Two shops were damaged by incendiary devices in PORTADOWN on 15 September and on the same day three weapons. ammunition and firearms were stolen from the homes of two UON men. 
8 INFANTRY BRIGADE 9. 
The City has become increasingly active. The number of 
casualties has increased and the Derry Young Hooligans (DYH) have been much more in evidence. Nevertheless incidents of passive co-operation and in some cases active assistance, give some hope, e.g. a 200 lb mine was reported to Security Forces by a Catholic priest amongst others, and in one incident on Monday local parents persuaded young hooligans to disperse. Provisional leaders remain in BUNGRANA though a number of snipers have reappeared in the CREGGAN causing one death and three injured(two VSI). 
24 AIRPORTABLE BRIGADE(less BELFAST) 
10. The area was quiet other than inLARNE when on 17 September following the petrol bombing of the home of a Catholic member of the RUC Reserves the RUC came under fire. Fire was returned and either in crossfire or purposeful terrorist gunfire two men were killed. The ensuing gunbattle and inter-sectarian rioting was cooled by the timely reaction of five Royal Marines who were by chance running a ’Community Relations’ camp nearby. On 13 September there were violent disturbances in CARRICKFERGUS when the sixteen UDA men were remanded in custody on the MONKSTOWN arms charges, seven RUC officers were slightly injured. Yesterday all sixteen were released on bail of £900 each! 
PROPOAGANDA 
11. Another attempt has been made to make propaganda capital out of the stationing of troops in a corner of the grounds of the Royal Victoria Hospital BELFAST. In a similar vein, the Provisional IRA have declared the Cathedrals and hospitals in ARMAGH to be legitimate targets. An effort has been made to charm flagging support in the South by accusations that we are firing indiscriminately into crowds. The aim is to persuade the Premier, Mr Lynch, to raise the actions of the British Army with HMG. The usual accusations of brutality and atrocities have continued but with a swing away from the idea of schools as a theme in favour of brutality at Long Kesh, although most of the actions have fallen on the RUC. We have encouraged the isolation of extremists in the UDA and the UVF as the opportunity has occurred. The actions of the militant UDA and UVF on the SHANKILL and in LARNE have helped to disaffect some moderate opinion away from support for these extreme organisations. 
OUTLOOK 
12. The Constitutional Conference will surely dominate the events of the coming week. It is expected that both factions will continue to demonstrate their strength by headline seeking events. Hostile propaganda intent on frustrating high military morale and disaffecting moderate opinion is however likely to be intensified particularly as even the extremists jostle for a respectable platform.

by Ministers last week, and it, together with a Memorandum from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, will be circulated for the further discussions due to take place later this week. 
will be whether any announcement of conclusions should be made before the Conference, and if so how those conclusions should be communicated to the Government of the Irish Republic and the S.D.L.P. 2. 
One question to be considered If there is to be any dismantling of the Special Powers Act discussions 
will be necessary between the Northern Ireland Office and Ministry of Defence. ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT 3. 
The Northern Ireland Office is in touch with the Ministry of Defence 
about members of the U.D.R. who become involved with the Ulster Defence Association, and, in particular, three members of the Regiment who were involved in recent court proceedings. OPERATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE 4. 
Violence has continued to be at a relatively low level, but casualties to the security forces remain serious. 
Reasons for the lull are uncertain. 
Operation Motorman has had some effect, as has the comparative loss of public support for the Provisionals, who are not as yet doing much to counter this. There may also be some uncertainity in the Provisionals’ own ranks about future policy. 
But the possibility that they are planning a major act of 
terrorism cannot be ruled out. 5.

Protestant militants remain divided, in spite of recent efforts to present The leadership has talked of restoring relations with the

both Provisional IRA and Protestant extremist groups must be expected to attempt to carry out activity designed to show that without their participation the conference cannot be expected to succeed. 
5. The Provisional IRA, which has conducted activity at a low 
level during the last few weeks, must be expected to raise this level. In this they are likely to further concentrate attacks on the security forces, and a bombing offensive prior to the conference cannot be ruled out. 
6. The UDA is likely to concentrate on its propaganda campaign 
in an effort to embarrass the security forces, and less on street activity. Nonetheless, it is far from being a monolithic organisation and individual groups may seek a confrontation with the army.

Annex A to A/BR/30/1/M04 Dated 3 September 1972 
HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 13 SEPTEMBER 1972 
INTRODUCTION 
1. General. A number of events have held the headlines on the Irish scene during this period. The Protestant rioting of the first three nights of last week culminated inevitably in shooting between the Security Forces and UVF - 
inspired 
extremists in which two Protestants were killed and two wounded. Despite the deaths of 3 soldiers over the weekend caused by a Provisional mine, petulant Protestants are prepared to strike and demonstrate for the removal of the regiment they consider responsible for the deaths of their so-called innocent citizens. Much of the current terrorist activity is designed to promote the power of the faction concerned prior to the Secretary of State’s talks and, just as the UVF - 
inspired 
action was set up to show the strength of the Protestant front, further IRA atrocities can be expected to attempt to prove their domination of events. An extension of this ’jockeying’ is the emergence, after weeks of disarray, of a new hard line Protestant political party which unites the Vanguard, the para-military Ulster Defence Association and the Loyalist Association of Workers. It was significant that the tragedy of Munich aroused universal anger and condemnation even though Northern Ireland had endured death and destruction on a far greater scale without the spontaneous outflow of sympathy and the creation of the will to act internationally against terrorism. 
2. IRA Activity. Despite reports that the Provisional IRA campaign in Ulster would be intensified in order to disrupt the Secretary of State’s conference, it has remained subdued. The level of bomb attacks and snipings have remained at much the same level as last week. With the exception of the mining of a Saracen near Dungannon the Border has been virtually free of serious incidents. Although 8 soldiers were injured in 132 urban sniping incidents, there are indications that in Belfast the IRA’s reduced activity may be due to low morale in their battalions caused by the continued pressure of the current phase of Operation Motorman. 
3. Protestant Activity. Militant Protestant activity has dominated the situation during the week. On 7 September two civilians were shot dead and two wounded in the Shankill after Security Forces came under fire. In a statement on 8th September the UDA denied ’official involvement’ in the shooting although it was implicitly admitted that individual members acting without authority might have been involved. Nevertheless the UDA have used the incident to boost their flagging support and their already active propaganda campaign against the Security Forces. Furthermore, in a protest at the continued presence of the Parachute Regiment in the Shankill, the Belfast East and West Power Stations, largely staffed by member of LAW, are on strike. The activities of the UDA continue to pose a threat in the Portadown area; a number of cases of intimidation of Catholic families combined with a less friendly demeanour toward the Security Forces are all indications of the changed mood. 
4. Security Forces Activity. The domination of hard Catholic areas continues. Detention orders have been signed on a number of Provisionals. Large hauls of firearms and ammunition have been recovered in search operations which have become increasingly successful as more information is received from those members of the public who are becoming increasingly disaffected with the IRA.Battalions are beginning to know who and what is in their areas and the coming weeks should see more arrests and hence further inroads will be made into the IRA organisation. Patrolling continues in Border and Rural areas and, despite the tragic mining incident on Sunday, their success maybe measured in the significant reduction in explosives used, in the increased routine finds and the arrest figures produced by intensive alert patrolling.

5. Belfast. On the night of 7 September following three nights of increasing 
Tartan gang violence in East and Went Belfast, in which patrols were stoned, property damaged and individual Catholics intimidated, soldiers came under fire from extreme Protestants. A mobile patrol off the Shankill attempted to disperse a crowd of UDA and was fired on from several locations. In the resulting exchange of fire 2 civilians were shot dead and 2 injured. Intelligence confirms that the UVF opened the firing, and the UDA only joined in after the Security Forces had returned the UVF fire. Shots were fired at Security Forces in Protestant areas of the city later the same evening, and again on 8 and 9 September. Crowds of Protestants demonstrated in the area of Tennant Street RUC Station on 8 September in protest at military activities on the previous night. Mr Brian Faulkner, the former Prime Minister, and Mr Stratton Mills MP, also present but in a concillatory mood were jostled and several RUC men attacked. During a search of a public house used as a headquarters by the UDA on 7 September, Security Forces found one sniperscope, pipe and nail bomb-making material, several radio transceivers and a small quantity of ammunition. On the same night, a farmhouse near Monkstown (North Belfast) was searched and a quantity of television sets and other stolen property was found. A more detailed search led to the recovery of 6 rifles, one Sten gun, one .38 revolver and 6,000 rounds of ammunition. 
6. Security Forces have continued to come under sniper fire in Catholic areas, and 4 soldiers have been injured in this way. The bombing campaign has continued but at a very low level with only 4 explosions, attributable to the IRA. Unexplained murders have continued, 2 civilians shot dead and 3 injured in separate incidents not involving the Security Forces. One of the dead was a Protestant partner of a mixed marriage, and the other a Protestant criminal on remand. Minor street unrest has taken place in Catholic areas and patrols have been stoned. 
3 Infantry Brigade 
7. There have been further incidents in Portadown and Armagh, but the most serious occurred near Dungannon early on 11 September when an armoured vehicle was blown up by a large land mine. Three soldiers were killed and 4 injured, two very seriously. There was street unrest in Portadown on 7 September as Security Forces attempted to disperse 100 masked UDA men. A bomb which detonated outside a Catholic-owned bar in the town on 6 September, and which killed the driver of a passing car an off-duty member of the UDR, is believed to have been planted by Protestants. In Armagh, Security Forces came under fire on the evening of 8 September after the Northern Resistance Movement Parade addressed by Michael Farrell, had dispersed. Patrols had been the target of snipers on 2 previous occasions in the city during the week, without suffering casualties. 
8 Infantry Brigade 
8. The city has had a further comparatively quiet week, and it is evident that the Provisional IRA are suffering a serious loss of support in the enclave. There were 15 shooting incidents (3 soldiers injured) and 3 explosions in commercial premises in the Strand Road area. There has been minor street unrest in the Creggan throughout the week. 
Propaganda 
9. Whilst schools, brutalities and atrocities still continue to be current IRA themes, the statement attacking the so called occupation of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast is new and somewhat unexpected. We occupy a small area of the hospital grounds and buildings no longer required by the hospital authorities and have been doing so since 1969. It appears that this is a propaganda attack mounted in the hope of getting us out of that area which military assaults have failed to do. We have countered the Provisionals allegations by appearences on TV and radio as well as by statements to the press. 1 PARA have come under heavy propaganda attack from

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 080700 to 110700 HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 GENERAL 
1. After the Shankill confrontation on Thursday and the march to Tennent Street RUC station by 350 workers from Harland and Wolff on Friday, the weekend turned out to be relatively quiet, considering the potentially explosive situation. For the second successive weekend the level of violence was higher on Sat/Sun (approx 40 shooting 
incidents - 31 of 
them in Belfast - and 1 explosion) compared with Fri/Sat (24 shootings 3 explosions) and Sun/Mon (20 shootings 2 explosions . Casualties totalled 3 soldiers killed and 9 wounded; 1 RUC wounded 3 civilians injured, and 1 terrorist claimed hit. BELFAST saw most of the action. LONDONDERRY was very quiet except for one bomb explosion (30 lbs) which destroyed a cafe. In the countryside, a Northern Resistence Movement meeting was held on Saturday in Armagh, at which the speakers, approved the Slack September actions in Munich amongst other things and it ended with 39 batons having to be fired to disperse the crowd. 27 Borstal Boys rioted in Armagh Jail. Near Dungannon a 300-400 lb claymore type device was command detonated on Sunday night from a dead ground position 
70 yards away. It killed 2 and wounded 3 A & SH soldiers in a Saracen. One of the wounded subsequently died. On the border the newly built Customs post at Auchnacley was destroyed again. In GB weekend press comment concentrated on the deterioration in relations between tho Protestant community and the Army in general and 1 PARA in particular. The News of the World had banner headlines concerning an autumn IRA bombing campaign in GB . The Sunday Tele graph carri ed a revealing biography of John Stephenson. 
2. During Fri/Sat 8/9 Sep 72. It was quiet in Ulster except in Belfast where a march of about 350 workers from Harland and Wolff to the Tennent St RUC station had all the makings of a possible serious disturbance. However after speeches from Mr Faulkner and other Protestant leaders the crowd dispersed and all was peaceful at 1500 hours. SF were involved in 18 of 24 shooting incidents, in one of these LCPL Taylor, 3 RGJ sustained a minor wound. In the rural areas there were 3 bomb explosions, one extensively damaged the newly built Customs Post at Aughnacloy. Later a claymore mine exploded when a patrol was searching the area. One civilian was slightly injured. It is thought the mine was detonated by radio. In Armagh youths stoned SF. 
3. During Sat/Sun 9/10 Be 72. There was an increase in shooting incidents. SF being involved in 24 of 36. In Belfast, fire was returned 8 times and initiated 6 times in 19 incidents. 2 hits were claimed. PTE Blackmore 1 LI was slightly wounded by a blast bomb. Londonderry was notably quiet all day. In Armagh following the Northern Resistance Movement parade of about 300 people, 39 baton rounds were fired to disperse the crowd. Later 27 Berstel boys rioted in Armagh Jail and took themselves to the roof. The RUC remained in charge of the situation throughout.

2. The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. 
3. The weekly intelligence report as at 8 September 1972 has been issued separately. OUTLOOK 
4. The effect on the level of terrorist activity of any internal debate within the Provisional IRA as a result of recent press articles is difficult to estimate, and will clearly depend upon whether there is rank and file reaction to these events possibly leading to a leadership struggle. As yet there is no intelligence to indicate this happening. However, the Provisional IRA must be expected to carry out some offensive if they are not to lose the initiative completely. 
5. The Officials can be expected to try to take advantage of any long or short term embarrassment felt by the Provisionals, as a result of the recut disclosures. 
6. The UDA must be expected to attempt to further embarrass and harass the security forces as the talks on the future of Northern Ireland approach. Reports have been received that their activities will be stepped up later this month.

Annex A to A/BR/30/1/M04 Dated 7 September 1972 
UPDATING POINTS FOR HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY AS AT FRIDAY 8 SEPTEMBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
The main development of the period has been clear evidence of 
increased Protestant terrorist activity, notably the Shankill gunbattle between Protestants and Army patrols on Thursday night and the significant find of arms and explosive on Thursday which led to the arrest of 16 Protestants. 
TERRORIST ACTIVITY 2. 
IRA a. 
Some 62 shooting incidents have occurred, mostly involving the IRA, 
a considerable increase over the previous period. There has been a total of 9 bomb incidents (of all types), 3 on Wednesday, 5 on Thursday, only 3 in Belfast. The 2 bombs in Londonderry on Thursday are a significant increase. 
b. c. The Provisionals have denied reports of a leadership or loyalty crisis. An unusual tactic was revealed by the discovery of a tunnel dug from 
an RC house in Belfast towards an Army OP. d. 
3. 
Protestant a. 
In a border incident on Thursday, 2 soldiers of 1A and SH were wounded 
when their patrol was ambushed. A rifle and ammunition was recovered 50m across the border, with the cooperation of the Garda. 
The major gunbattle between 1 PARA and Protestant gunmen in the Shankill 
which lasted from 2020 to 2110 on Thursday, was initiated by the gunmen as UDA hooligans withdrew. 2 Protestants were killed and 2 received GSW; a further hit is claimed. The situation was cooled after CO 1 PARA had spoken to Anderson but the atmosphere was explosive for a time. The large quantity of equipment recovered from UDA HQ in Wilton Street included a sniperscope, bomb-making gear, ammunition, medical kit and radios. 
b. The significant find (8 assorted weapons, explosives, uniform, a radio 
and stolen cars) in Monkstown by 40 Cdo acting on RUC information, led to the arrest on Thursday of 16 Protestants all of whom have been charged and remanded in custody. 3 of them are UDR soldiers. 
c. Incidents of UDA masked and cudgelled activity occurred on both days 
in Belfast, much of it ostensibly to protect schoolchildren. Outside Belfast, militant activity has been negligible, but 100 UDA ran riot for a time in Portadown on Thursday evening 2 Protestants were arrested and later released pending summons. 
4. Other. Intersectarian or motiveless murders continue the bodies of 2 
Protestants were discovered on Wednesday/Thursday night. Incidents of juvenile hooliganism have continued, mostly in Belfast. 
SECURITY FORCES 5. 
There have been no significant changes in deployment or profile. While 
Catholic attitudes towards Security Forces remain unchanged, the attitude of the UDA, notably in Belfast, appears to have hardened considerably.

22. Successful bomb attacks have been made near STRABANE. In the most recent attack a Water Pumping Station at SION MILLS was destroyed by two bombs. Eight incendiary devices damaged Protestant owned shops in Ballymena. Two of the shops were gutted by fire. This incident follows a less successful incendiary attack on a Protestant owned Supermarket in the Waterside area of LONDONDERRY. 
23. On 3 September a Security Force ambush challenged two men near the border in the North of the Enclave and opened fire when one man drew a pistol. One hit was claimed. Gunmen ambushed a patrol between Maghera and Toomebridge area on night 30 31 August but there were no casulaties. 
Propaganda 
24. IRA propaganda themes continue on the same lines as the past few weeks. Considerable play has been made on the occupation of schools and the opening of the school term. Our counter has been to ensure publicity for the evacuation of some schools and the efforts being made of alternative arrangements in the case of those we still have to occupy. Once again every opportunity has been taken by the IRA propagandists to utilise every story of brutality and atrocity to the maximum. 
25. Perhaps the major event in the propaganda field has been the revelations of Maria McGuire into the leadership crisis of the Provisionals. Judging by the stream of denials issued, this is having some effect. Our alleged harassment of the UDA has led to a severing of "diplomatic relations" with them; we can confidently expect an increased amount of propaganda from this source. 
Outlook 
26. The effect on the level of terrorist activity of any internal debate within the Provisional IRA as a result of recent press articles is difficult to estimate. It will depend on the reaction of the rank and file which itself could lead to a leadership struggle. As yet there is no intelligence to indicate this happening. The current level of violence is likely to be maintained with concentration on Security Force targets. 
27. The Officials can be expected to try to take advantage of any long or short term embarrassment felt by the Provisionals as a result of the recent disclosures. 
28. The UDA has indicated that it will return to a more militant posture towards the Security Forces. There may therefore be a greater risk of confrontations with the Security Forces.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 010700 TO 040700 SEPTEMBER 72 1. 
GENERAL. The level of violence was low on Fri/Sat (18 shootings 4 
explosions) and Sun/Mon (16 shootings 2 explosions) but higher than usual on Sat/Sun (55 shootings 38 in Belfast nil explosions). In all one soldier was killed (accidentally); three soldiers and one RUC constable were wounded; and six civilains were hurt. In Belfast at 0410 hrs on Sunday morning two patrols met in 40 Cdo area (NEW LODGE) and engaged one another accidentally. Gnr CUTTING (7 Bty RA att 40 Cdo) was killed and one gunner and one marine were wounded. On Sunday afternnon in Andersonstown both Catholic civil rights movements supported by a number of parents and teachers, in all about 400, demonstrated against continued use by Security Forces of Catholic schools. (Term begins again today 4 Sep). Londonderry was quiet, as was the border. In the countryside, there were a few assorted incidents, mostly in Portadown. In Great Britain, weekend press comment featured the disclosures of the Provisional defector 
, whose position in law is unclear - she 
is reportedly wanted by Interpol in connection with the attempt to fly Czech arms through Amsterdam on 16 Oct 1971. The main points she made were that there is a power struggle within the Provisional leadership, who are under pressure to call off the bombing compaign; that a real power resides in the hands of Stephenson ( a bigoted murderer) in Dublin, and Toomey in Belfast, where the dynamic for the whole campaign exists; that anger among Northern Catholics in general has been growing because of the political sterility of a purely terrorist policy; and that the IRA must call a cease fire and talk, while HMG must realise that the IRA must have a place at some ultimate conference table. In the Republic, the Provisionals issued a statement dismissing the allegations made in England by Maria McGuire, claiming that she was of no consequence in the organisation and knew little of significance. 
Elsewhere, Mr Heath meets Mr Lynch today 4 Sep in Munich at the Olympic Games. 2. During FRI/SAT 1/2 SEP 72 the Province was quiet. There were 17 shooting 
incidents of which 14 involved the Security Forces. A Corporal in 40 Cdo was wounded in the leg by gunfire. There was one explosion, and ATO detonated 3 devices. There was a spate of arson in Portadown, thought to be an attempt by Protestants to set up an intersectarian clash. 
3. During SAT/SUN 2/3 SEP 72 there was a marked increase in shooting and in 
Belfast the level was the highest since Motorman. However there were no explosions, although there was a spate of incendiary attacks against Protestant owned shops in Ballymena In an incident in Belfast 2 patrols mistook each other for gunmen and exchanged fire; one soldier was killed and two wounded. Elsewhere two soldiers, and an RUC constable were wounded one of whom was on leave. Four civilians wore wounded and 4 hits were claimed. 
4. During SUN/MON 3/4 SEP 72 there were fewer incidents than the day before. 
There were 16 shooting incidents of which Security Forces were involved in 12. There were two explosions. There were no Security Force casualties or hits claimed, but two civilians were wounded in Belfast. There was a demonstration in Andersonstown against the use of schools by Security Forces. In Co Londonderry UDR fired over the heads of an angry crowd at a VCP; Bernadette Devlin rang HQ Northern Ireland 
hat they were firing at the crowd.

1. Headquarters Northern Ireland weekly operAtional summary for the week ending 30 August 1972 was circulated under Reference A. An updating of the summary up to 0800hrs Friday 1 September is attached at Annex A. 
2. The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. 
3. The weekly intelligence report as at 1 September 1972 has been issued separately. OUTLOOK 
4. The Provisional IRA are likely to seek an intensification of the campaign: in this it is likely that they will concentrate of sniping in all areas and mine attacks against the Security Forces. Explosive attacks against commercial targets will continue, and an attempt may be made to carry out a "spectacular" operation or series of operation, aimed at obtaining maximum media coverage. It is likely that Belfast city centre could be a target in such an attack. 
5. Intimidation in Republican areas may increase as the terrorists continue to be alienated from the minority. 
6. There are some indications of splits within the Officials, but no evidence that significant numbers intend to resume militant activities. 
7. There remains the possibility of Protestant bomb attacks being mounted: however, the majority of the Protestant population will continue to show restraint, especially while their leadership remains fragmented.

UPDATING POINTS FOR HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY AS AT FRIDAY 1 SEPTEMBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
IRA Activity. Concerted efforts have been made by the Provisionals to 
renew offensive operations in Londonderry. Four bombs were placed in Strand Road/Waterloo Place on 31 August. All are believed to have been smuggled through check points by girls. There are obvious difficulties in searching female for small quantities of explosives (however steps are being taken to reinforce WRAC Provcet). Attacks on Customs Posts continue and further successful bomb attacks are being made on public utility installations around Strabane. The Provisional IRA continue to carry out sniping attacks. 
2. Protestant Activity. The Protestant organisation remain outwardly subdued however the shooting of two Catholics in the Shankill area seems to be the work of a Protestant extremist organisation. The shooting of a young Catholic in Rugby Road, a mixed area, could have been carried out by extremists of either faction. He is believed to have been a drug taker and this could have provided an excuse for his killing. 
3. Security Forces Activity. RUC mobile patrols continue in the Bogside and Creggan and RMP continue to patrol all Catholic areas throughout the Province. Three Protestant weapons have been seized and one armed Protestant was arrested in Portadown. This caused an immediate reaction from a large crowd of Protestants but the Security Forces succeeded in cooling the situation down. Arms and explosives finds were made in Andersonstown, Falls Rd and the Coalisland area.

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 30 AUGUST 1972 
Introduction 
1. IRA Activity. Shooting incidents at Security Forces have increased marginally over the previous week. However a major shooting incident lasting 3 hrs took place in Beechmount area in which 2000 rounds were exchanged. 
There were 33 explosions during the week, many of which were 
in rural areas and once again a premature explosion killed two or possibly three bombers. SF casualties continue to be heavy, 7 killed and 26 wounded including 2 UDR soldiers killed in an explosion and 2 soldiers being killed by sniper fire. The Provisional IRA has extended its campaign of intimidation, not only to deter the civilian population from assisting the SF but to force them to assist the IRA through fear rather than through political conviction. Recent statements by the Provisional IRA have emphasised their determination to press attacks against military targets. 
2. Protestant Activity. The Royal Black Preceptory marches of 26 August passed without incident. For the last 3 years these marches had not taken place because of the blanket ban on parades. UDA activity has been less noticeable as have the activities of the Protestant extremists although information linking them with recent acts of violence continues to be confirmed. There is also evidence that general crime is taking place under the cloak of the UDA but without the permission or approval of the Inner Council. The RUC have arrested 6 Protestants, 2 armed, in two separate incidents. Neither incident had sectarian or political overtones but those serve as examples of a section of the Protestant community which is taking advantage of the existing state of lawlessness. 
3. A number of antique UVF weapons were discovered buried in a freshly dug hole at the North of the Crumlin Road. 
4. Security Forces Activity. There has been no change to the recent policy of maintai 
patrols in all areas with the intention of restricting the 
movement of bombers and gunmen. Arrests of wanted men have continued, among them Thomas Gorman and Desmond Mackin, who has since been charged with the attempted murder of Lt Watt, 2 Fd Regt RA. Gorman is also believed to be responsible for the increasingly sophisticated explosive devices which have been found in the Andersonstown area. A number of weapons have been found including two Armalite AR 180 rifles, bringing the total of armalite rifles found during Op MOTORMAN to at least eleven and the number of SLRs recovered to 3. 
4. Op GRENADA patrols continue despite the disruption caused to the minesweeper refitting programme by the industrial problems in the naval dockyards. The two most recent patrols were carried out by fishery protection vessels. Since 1 January 1972 over 430 ships have been boarded by minesweepers of the Royal Navy and the LRRSC of the Royal Air Force. Although no arms have been found the continuous presence of the patrol is well known to all ships who sail in Northern Ireland waters and acts as a constant and effective threat to seaborne gun-running. 
5. As a result of the interrogation of 15 people between 25 and 28 August 1972 one successful arrest operation was mounted and 3 IRA Provisionals out of a planned total of 7 were arrested.

13. Reports in the press indicate that two Belfast youths have appeared at a special court in Dundalk following their arrest in possession of a stolen car.

15. A Sinn Fein march organised in the Creggan against the military presence was attended by 500. 
This was taken as an excuse for hooliganism by 200 
local delinquents and 4 soldiers were injured in the stoning which followed. Over 200 baton rounds were fired before the mob dispersed. 
16. Members of the 30 strong Creggan and Bogside CESA appeared in uniforms but although they were in groups of 6 or so, they made no attempts initially to stop traffic. 
However in the last 48 hours they are reported to have stopped some vehicles. 
17. The UDA have not been prominent this week and the few incidents that have been reported are considered to involve loafers rather than UDA members. 
18. In an incident in Strabane a Protestant guitarist and his two sisters were injured by a booby trap placed near the Army check point. 
This is 
the second incident in recent weeks in which civilians hav picked up innocent objects which have subsequently proved to be booby traps. 
Propaganda 19. The propaganda themes remain unchanged in principle. 
The campaign The 
These 
reports are the only indications available of any increased activity by the Irish Security in borer areas. 
against the Army’s presence in Catholic areas has continued and stories of alleged atrocities and brutality are exploited to the full. 
Provisional IRA have stepped up their efforts to discourage fraternisation by using leaflets and intimidation. An encouraging feature has been the recent condemnation of the Provisionals intimidation of the Catholic residents of Riverdale by Roman Catholic Priests in Church on Sunday. 
Outlook 
20. The Provisional IRA are likely to seek an intensification of the campaign. It is likely that they will concentrate on sniping in all areas and wine attacks against SF and explosive attacks against commercial targets will continue. 
An attempt may be made to carry out a "spetacular" operation or series of operations aimed at obtaining maximum new media coverage. 
21. There are some signs of splits within the Officials, but no evidence that significant numbers intend to resume militant activities. 
22. While in the current period no extremist Protestant bomb attacks have been mounted these remain a possibility in the future.

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 23 AUGUST 1972 
INTRODUCTION IRA Violence 1. 
The marked decrease in shooting incidents involving the Security 
Forces and the increase in Security Force casualties suggests a greater selectivity in choice of targets. However the number of explosions has increased, although a number of the targets have been in suburban areas. Attacks on the electricity supply system continue in the country. A large premature explosion in Newry killed 8 people including two terrorists and injured six bringing the total of civilian casualties during the week to 11 killed and 78 wounded. IRA casualties claimed during the period are nine. 
Protestant Violence 2. 
Although there have been widespread reports of UDA road blocks and 
of motorists being beaten up by UDA men in remote parts of the Province only three such road blocks were seen and dealt with by Security Forces. Three bombs planted in Catholic areas are believed to be the work of Protestant extremists. 
Security Forces Activities. 3. 
The Security Forces have continued to maintain patrols 
with the intention of restricting the movement of bombers and gunmen in all areas. This activity has tended to be concentrated in urban areas with the result that the terrorists have chosen soft targets in the suburbs. However the number of shooting incidents has decreased and finds and arrests continue to be made. It is to be noted that no IRA terrorists and only a single weapon have been recovered as a result of information received in questioning at the Police Offices. 
RUC Patrols in Catholic Areas 4. 
Joint RUC/RMP patrols have now been taking place in Catholic areas 
for two weeks. Despite the willingness of the individual constables to carry out these patrols it has become evident that the majority of Catholics in these areas are not prepared to tolerate an RUC presence. The RUC are well aware of this feeling and consider that it will be a long time before they are accepted. 
Political 5. 
The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland holds its conference of all Loyalist political groups today , 23 Aug 72. The Vanguard Movement threat to 
become a political party may materialise if the conference does not succeed in achieving a measure of unity amongst the Loyalist Organisations. It is interesting that unity was the theme taken by all the speakers at the poorly supported UDA/LAW rally in Belfast on 19 August.

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
6. It is known that there is some strength of feeling within the 
Vanguard leadership that a new Protestant political leader is a prerequisite to a united Protestant front which they believe should represent the Protestant people at the Secretary of State’s conference. 
Belfast 7. 
A reduction in shooting incidents has been accompanied by heavy 
Army casualties(three killed and 17 wounded.) There have been two instances of claymore type mines being used in the town, on the Glen Road and in Cupar Street. These two devices were both command detonated but their use in built up areas shows utter disregard for human life. During a search of a deserted building an alert ATO discovered a light sensitive cell which was set up to initiate a charge when the light of a torch fell on it. This is yet another degree of sophistication in the terrorist’s campaign against arms searches and ATOs. This sophistication was not matched by the partial failure of three bombs planted in Catholic areas of East Belfast. They were all large bombs 100-200 lbs but all failed to detonate fully. It is believed that Protestant extremists were responsible and it is interesting that despite the experience in commercial explosives field that must exist in the Protestant Community such inexpert bombs should be planted. Assassinations of both Catholics and Protestants continue and little or no information has been received which might lead to those responsible. The move from St Pauls Secondary School and St Josephs Training College is complete and the target date for the vacation of the remaining six schools remains 1 September. 
8. In one of the 18 shooting incidents in Andersonstown during the 
week a REME Cpl was shot and is very seriously ill. The rounds were fired into the Holy Child School post from a nearby house by two gunmen. 
3 Infantry Brigade 9. 
The area has been relatively quiet but a sapper officer and an 
NCO of 1 S & SH were wounded in separate shooting incidents. Searches continued and a quantity of explosives were found near ARMAGH. 
10. Attacks on pylons continued but the two most significant incidents were the bomb in the Customs Clearance Station in Newry and the use of a pressure switch to detonate a mine which had been laid as part of a carefully planned ambush. In the former incident two men planting the bomb in the Customs building were killed when the bomb exploded prematurely. Four customs personnel and two lorry drivers, all Catholics, were also killed by the explosion and six other civilians were injured. This is the second premature explosion in Newry in the last three weeks. In the last incident one bomber died and three were injured in an attack on a garage. The use of the pressure switch is another step in the development of mines in rural areas which has evolved from trip wires to command detonation and from the principles of booby trapping both the main charge and the batteries to placing a number of smaller mines in the area around the main charge.

support for moderate politicians, there is a danger that the more extreme elements of the UDA will become disenchanted with political activities and resort once more to direct, violent action. 
10. Attitudes of RC Community. a. 
Moderates. In any event, a continued 
level of violence and lawlessness by some Protestant extremists. particularly UVF and VSC, can be expected. 
prepared to accept the provisions of the White Paper and likely to take p..rt in the elections. 
There is 
The community is undoubtedly tired of violence, generally However, the community remains susceptible to

possibility, considered at present to 
be remote, that some groups might boycott the elections if a significant movement demanding the release of detainees and "political" prisoners and the removal of the Army from RC areas should develop. 
b. Extremists. 
(1) The PIRA has declared its intention, and continues to demonstrate its ability to maintain its campaign of violence; there is good evidence that the PIRA continues to be supplied with high quality, modern weapons. There are encouraging signs, however, that the leadership is facing internal difficulties and that the SF’s rate of attrition is having a serious effect on morale and quality. It is currently believed that the Provisional Sinn Fein will not participate in the eleotions, although there remains the possibility of a change of heart. 
(2) The OIRA is clearly determined to contest the elections in another guise. However, although it professes that its ceasefire policy will be maintained, increasing evidence of the local involvement of OIRA members in terrorism continues. Should its support at the LGE prove to be minimal, the possibility of renewed, officially-sponsored violence 
cannot be discounted. The OIRA, too, is well equipped with weapons, ammunition and explosives. 
11. Non-Sectarian Attitudes. The major non-sectarian political groups are likely to contest the elections, though their support may be hampered by lack of funds. It is impossible to assess the extent of support for the Alliance Party for whom the LGE will be its first electoral contest. 
The participation of non-sectarian 
centre groups like Alliance and NILP may, by diverting attention from the Loyalist versus Republican issue, reduce the likelihood that extremists will intimidate voters or mount a planned campaign to disrupt the poll. The use of PR, and the consequent importance of voters’ second and third preferences, may also help to limit intimidation of voters (in so far as intimidation is based on rational calculations). 
12. Summary. a. 
With the Exception of VUPP, in the case of LGE, and the Provisional Sinn Fein 
in both cases, the elections are unlikely to be boycotted by any significant political group, though some of the smaller ones may reserve their efforts for the NIAE. 
b. Except for the PIRA which can be expected to attempt to interfere with 
the conduct of the elections wherever it can, there is unlikely to be a concerted campaign of disruption. 
c. The participation of a range of parties, and the presence in polling 
stations of agents from those parties, will tend to reduce the likelihood of armed attack on polling stations (except possibly by the PIRA).

4. It can be expected that the Provisional wing of the IRA will 
intensify their terrorist campaign at about the time the White Paper is published (P-Day) to mark their rejection of it. The reaction of the so-called "loyalist" extremists might at first take the form of industrial action, but, as with the general strike called for 7 February, there is a danger of such action deteriorating into violence. In more detail, the possible reactions of the two militant sections of the community could include any or all of the following: a. Protestant (1) Intimidation of isolated Catholics and increasing Catholic murders. (2) Demonstrations, marches, riots and unruly behaviour on the streets. (3) Picketing, or attempted disruption of the security forces, local government offices, etc, and possibly demonstrations or attacks at Stormont itself. (4) barricading of some Protestant areas. (5) Large scale rioting and attacks on Cautholic areas, and possibly the burning of homes. (6) Assassination of military and political VIPs. (7) Strikes in public utilities. 
b. Catholics (1) Reaction to any of the actions just described above including counter-murders. (2) Barricading of Catholic areas. (3) Intensification of the bombing and shooting campaign. (4) Assassination of political and military VIPs. 
The reaction by militant Protestants could be on a scale greater than yet encountered and although reinforcements would not be deployed unless

BORDER PLEBISCITE - SECURITY ASSESSMENT 1. I have now received an official request 
from HQ NI for two extra battalions for the border plebiscite on 3/4 Mar 73..........................FLAG A They ask for confirmation that if the White Paper is to be published in March they may retain the two extra battalions until after publication. 
2. The detailed assessment is at........................FLAG B 
I do not think you need read the whole of this but you should note: 
a. They estimate that 200 of the 390 polling stations will require a military 
presence....................................SIDEFLAG 1 b.

The summary of Military taks........................SIDEFLAG 2 The UDR will be on full call-out......................SIDEFLAG 3 
One Important proviso from HQ NI is that 
although their assessment takes account of the upsurge of militant Protestant violence on 7 Feb it assumes that there will be no appreciable deterioration in the security situation before 8 March. If it did deteriorate additional reinforcements might be required for deployment in Protestant areas.............................................SIDEFLAG 4

7. Some moderate Catholics may wish, for a variety of reasons, 
to vote. Lost of these will no doubt take advantage of the total vote, but it is expected that both wings of the Sinn Fein/IRA would seek, by intimidation, to prevent Catholics, in general, from voting. In some areas the IRA will see. polling stations, or the Security Forces guarding them, as convenient target for attacks. Such attacks might also include attempts to remove or destroy ballot boxes. There are some indications that NICRA plan a more militant policy towards the conduct of the plebiscite, although to date no specific evidence is available. 
8. On present evidence, the vast majority of Protestants, both 
extremist and moderate, are likely to support the plebiscite, assuming that it is held before the publication of the White Paper. Some apprehension has been voiced by those who will have to vote in predominantly Republican areas and who fear intimidation, and a few Protestant voters will probably vote by post rather than risk this. As the prevailing attitude of Catholics generally towards the plebiscite is one of indifference, it is doubted whether there will be widespread intimidation of Protestants. If there are outbreaks of violence, these are expected to occur in areas where Catholics are in the minority rather than vice versa. 
9. There is no firm evidence to believe that there will be 
attempts to frustrate the holding of the plebiscite, eg by strike or other industrial action aimed at creating a situation in which it would be impossible for the plebiscite to take place. 
OTHER SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS 
10. Closure of Schools. There are some indications that children will be used to disrupt polling, particularly in areas of West Belfast where some schools have to be closed to allow polling stations to be established. 
In order to minimize the threat from 
large numbers of school children on the streets, S of S has invited the Ministry of Education to advise headmasters of schools which are not being used as polling stations to remain open on 8 larch. 
11. Road Closure in Border Areas. There is as yet no firm indication that terrorists or groups of people from the Republic will travel north to discourage or disrupt the events of polling day. In spite of this it would be only prudent to strengthen patrolling in border areas on the day of the poll. 
ASSESSMENT OF SECURITY FORCE TASKS 
12. In the course of several discussions with Officials from Stormont, MOHA and with the Under Sherrifs it has been agreed that the Security Forces should take on the following commitments in connection with the plebiscite (in chronological order). 
13. Protection of Courthouses/County Halls. The Under Sherrifs 
have selected a total of twelve Courthouses/County Halls in which to prepare and issue voting cards, ballot papers and applications to vote by post. In late February, postal votes are to be returned to County Halls for safekeeping before they are included in the count on 9 Mar. It can be seen that destruction of these buildings or more specifically the papers and documents held there could seriously prejudice the conduct of the plebiscite. The guarding of these buildings is an RUC responsibility, but it will be necessary

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
19. Protection of the Counting House. Once all the ballot boxes areat the counting house, the security of the place will become paramount. The effects of bombing or arson at the counting house during 9 
Mar could at one stroke place the whole plebiscite 
in grave jeopardy and provide the perpetrators with a resounding political and propaganda victory. Indeed once the plebiscite has started, terrorist interest in the counting house is likely to increase, and hence the need for the Security Forces to protect the place from, ideally, 1800 hrs 7 Mar. This task is to be the responsibility of the RUC, although after a preliminary recce the Army have undertaken to provide up to 4 pls to assist in the outer protection of the Floral Hall. The RUC are to be responsible for the immediate security of the Hall, together with the checking of all traffic and persons entering the secure area. 
20. Transporting Votes to Archives. After the count has been completed, the votes become Crown property and are to be transported to the Law Court Archies in Belfast for storage. This should pose no serious security problems, and will probably be done by the Under Sherrifs staff in conjunction with the RUC. 
21. Bomb Threat and Hoaxes. Because all the locations of polling stations have been published and are now known to the general public, the likelihood of bomb threats, hoaxes, or arson at these places has increased. There may well be an increased need for ATOs and their teams during the next four weeks to cope with a anticipated rash of bombing attempts at polling stations by extremists in their desire to show that the plebiscite should not be held. 
22. Summary of Tasks. It has been agreed that the Security Forces undertake the following tasks in connection with the plebiscite:- 
a. 
RUC (1) 
The protection of courthouses, county halls, and 
Sherrif’s offices. (2) 
Assistance in storing and transporting ballot 
boxes to polling stations on 7/8 Mar. (3) 
polling station on 8 Mar. (4) 
counting house. (5) (6) 
b. 
Army (1)

The patrolling and guarding of vulnerable polling

Assisting with the provision of escorts for staff 
and ballot boxes on their way to polling stations in sensitive areas.

a. Protectant (1) 
Intimidation of isolated Catholics and increasing Catholic assassinations. 
(2) Demonstrations, marches, riots and unruly behaviour on the streets.

(3) Picketing, or attempted disruption of the Security Forces, local government offices, etc, and possibly demonstrations or attacks at Stormont itself. 
(4) Barricading of some Protestant areas. 
(5) Large scale rioting and attacks on Catholic areas and possibly the burning of homes. (6) Assassination of military and political VIPs. (7) Strikes in public utilities. 
b. Catholics 
(1) Reaction to any of the actions just described above including counter-assassinations. (2) Barricading of Catholic areas. 
(3) Intensification of the bombing and shooting campaign. (4) Assassination of political and military VIPs. 
Concept of Operations 6. 
Catholic and Protestant areas is that in the Catholic areas the Army operates virtually independently because the RUC are not accepted by the public as an impartial force, whereas in Protestant areas they are. If elements of the Protestant population resort to violence, additional troops will have to be deployed into these areas, such as the Shankill and East Belfast, where presently law enforcement is largely conducted by the RUC. This deployment would inevitably lead to an armed confrontation with the Army. Once deployed in strength, and with a shooting campaign in progress, the Army would be forced to adopt a strategy of attrition against the extremists which Would be bound to alienate large sections of the Protestant community living in these areas. The Army’s actions could be construea to be represive and to be that of a British Army acting on Westminster orders to suppress Protestant Loyalists. This could weld the Protestant community against HMG,and cause some disaffection amongst the RUC and UDR. The implications of either over-reaction or a protracted campaign of attrition against Protestant extremists shielded by the majority population could be more serious than anything previously encountered. If widespread Protestant violence erupts, these risks cannot be avoided. They can best be minimised by adopting a concept of operations based on :- 
The fundamental difference in the concept of operations in 
a. Confronting Ulster Protestant extremists with Ulster Security Forces; that is the RUC, Army and UDR acting jointly and not the British Army acting independently. This has already been started by the formation of the Task Force and recent joint operations in the Shankill and East Belfast. 
b. The discrediting of Protestant extremists and their 
organizations before the White Paper is published so as to isolate these extremists from the bulk of the Protestant 
population, who may well remain apathetic whatever the contents of the White Paper. This could be achieved by adopting a major offensive Information Policy campaign directed from London and Stormont.

c. The gradual introduction of a selective arrest policy against militant Protestants whilst continuing the present arrest policy against members of the Provisional IRA, This will accustom the Protestant community to the detention of Protestants in advance of any outbreak of violent opposition to the White Paper. 
d. The bolstering of the RUC by attaching non-uniformed GB specialists to them. (This is a measure which needs urgent attention if the necessary personnel are to be in their posts in sufficient time to be effective when the White Paper is published). 
Military Plans to Counter the Threat 7. 
Op FLAXEN envisages the reinforcement of Northern Ireland by up 
to 10 battalions and an armoured car squadron together with their logistic support, and the deployment of these units firstly into Protestant areas of Belfast and then to Carrickfergus, Larne, Lisburn, Lurgan, Portadown, Armagh and elsewhere as required in the Province. It would be unwise to do this unless or until widespread Protestant violence breaks out and the necessity for large scale military action against militant Protestants is appreciated by the Protestant community 
Protestant opinion against HMG). The outbreak of widespread and serious Protestant violence is not expected to occur before the publication of the White Paper, and therefore Op FLAXEN is most likely to be implemented sometime after publication day. 
(any large scale pre-emptive action might quickly weld 8. Should the present situation in Protestant areas of Belfast 
deteriorate further, a contingency in Op FLAXEN envisages the reinforcement of the Province by up to three battalions to stabilize the situation before the Border Poll. In any event, the MOD have already agreed to our request for two or possibly three extra battalions for security duties during the period of the Border Poll. These battalions will remain in the Province if the White Paper is published within about 14 days of the Border Poll or longer if the security situation so necessitates. 
Summary 9. 
It is possible that the publication of the White Paper could 
herald a serious outbreak of violence from the extremists of either or both factions of the community. Operations against the Provisional IRA will continue, but a contingency plan (Op FLAXEN) has been prepared to deal with the threat from the militant Protestants. Should this come about the contingency plan envisages the reinforcement of the Province by up to 10 battalions and one armoured car squadron.. The first battalions to arrive would be deployed to Belfast. Subsequent battalions would move to other sensitive areas in the Province.

the 11-12 units mark (9 currently deployed plus 2 or 3 Plebiscite battalions). 
HQ Northern Ireland have been re-assessing the command The 39 Brigade force level would then rise above Originally, HQ Northern Ireland asked for an 
extra brigade headquarters and, as you will have seen in reference A, HQ 19 Airptbl Bde was nominated. 
But CLF now 
believes that there are overwhelming arguments in favour of merely grafting on a temporary Staff increment, including a second deputy commander, to HQ 39 Brigade. 
THE PROPOSAL 2. 
a. In principle, HQ Northern Ireland’s proposal rests on the 
need to avoid splitting the command arrangements for the Belfast area: 
Tactical Considerations. a tactical entity. Belfast is essentially Terrorists and terrorist mobs can 
(and do) move rapidly from one part of the city to another. Similarly, arms, ammunition and explosives are moved about quickly. 
Firm control of, and rapid reaction to, 
such events can only effectively be exercised by one headquarters. 
b. Operational Experience. 
the most difficult area to control in the Province experience and background knowledge are essential. 
Operationally, Belfast is An 
extra (inexperienced) brigade headquarters would arrive on P + 4 at the earliest when the "battle" could be at its height (as was the case with HQ 24 Bde during MOTORMAN).

(2) There would not be attacks on SF at once although the action might build up to that.

THE WHITE PAPER THREAT STUDY 1. The eruption of Protestant violence in October 1972 
demonstrated the ability and determination of extremists to report to areas to protect their interests. 
Since then, 
Protestant extremists have publicly avowed their intention of opposing any solution to the Northern Ireland problem which diminishes Protestant power. 
As the Catholics hold the opposite 
view, any compromise solution proposed by HMG which seeks to unify the mass of moderate citizens on each side of the sectarian divide will probably be opposed by the extremists in both oommunities. 
Thus the publication of HMG’s White Paper of 
legislative proposals for the future of Northern Ireland in early 1973 could provide the catalyst for a resumption of Protestant violence. 
but this cannot be done before the contents of the White Paper have been decided.

His assessment is therefore unlikely to be From military 
intelligence sources, it is already clear that the threat is sufficiently grave to warrant the preparation of contingency plans. Assumptions 2. 
This paper assumes that HMG’s legislation proposals for 
the future of Northern Ireland will seek to strike a compromise between the views of both opposing sets of extremists. 3. 
It also assumes that if Protestant violence erupts the 
majority of Protestants will remain passive and not actively support the extremists.

diminishes Protestant power is potentially explosive and could result in a determined campaign of violence to:- 
a. Influence moderate opinion against the proposals 
in the White Paper. b. 
Demonstrate to HMG that the Province is ungovernable 
unless their demands are granted. c. 
In the final analysis, Catholic problem by force. 
10. In the period leading up to the publication of the White Paper extremist Protestant action is continuing to be directed towards further exacerbating the situation by increasing indiscriminate sectarian assassinations, gangster type lawlessness, intimidation and enforced evictions of isolated Catholic families from their homes. 
These activities are beginning to cause a 
counter reaction from the Catholics and thus a gradual deterioration of the security situation. 
Once the White Paper is 
published extremist Protestant action could manifest itself in some or all the following ways, particularly in Belfast and its environs where the future destiny of the Province will probably be decided:- 
a. Industrial action by LAW to disrupt essential 
services and industry. b.

13. Thre is at present no clear indication of when the Protestant challenge will manifest itself. 
It is unlikely 
to be before the publication of the White Paper, but probably immediately after its contents become known the extremists will attempt to influence opinion and use the most opportune excuse to begin their campaign. 
This could reach a climax at the 
time of the Plebiscite, if it is held after the White Paper is published or the Local Elections or some deliberately staged incident. 
The initial outbreak of trouble is mostlikely 
to be in Belfast, where the militants are strongest and best organised. 
The likely duration of this violence is difficult to assess. There is little doubt that it will be 
very much better organised than the October riots and that the Protestants are capable of conducting an extended campaign, which presumably will continue until HMG accede to their demands or Security Forces action makes them desist. 
Much will depend 
upon the resolve shown by HMG to quell the disturbances and to impose a solution. 
This resolve will be manifest by 
Ministerial statements and the size and speed of Security Forces deployed. 
Provided there is a quick and determined 
reaction, the less militant Protestant organisations in the rural areas may remain quiescent and observe developments in Belfast and its environs. 
The moderates will probably remain 
apathetic as many of them sympathise with certain aspects of the extremist’s views and would like to see a retention of Protestant power. 
However, given these reasonably favourable circumstances 
it would be unrealistic to expect the combined efforts of the Army and RUC to force Protestant extremists to desist for some considerable time. On the other hand, a Protestant rejection of the extremists could result in their campaign collapsing in under a month. 
Conversely, any extremist campaign based on a general 
Protestant disapproval of the provisions of the White Paper could quickly result in a general uprising, which the general assumptions (see para 3 above) place outside the scope of this paper.

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
14. In the period leading up to the publication of the White Paper the security situation in the Protestant areas of Belfast and its environs is likely to continue to deteriorate as extremists attempt to undermine public confidence and Governmental authority by increasing their campaign of assassinations, gangster activities and intimidation of isolated Catholics and possibly the Police and Government officials. 
RUC 
15. The maintenance of order in Protestant areas, particularly in Belfast, is primarily an RUC responsibility, but clearly there are serious weaknesses which cannot be ignored:- 
a. Some lack the resolve to deal with extremist 
Protestants, as the Gusty Spence episode showed. b. 
Some are intimidated by the extremists. 
Constables have been beaten up and their homes have been attacked. c. 
Some are penetrated by the Protestant extremist 
organizations and many of them sympathise with militant Protestant aims. 
d. They are very short of high grade CID officers and efficient administrators. 
16. In the event of a Protestant revolt, widespread disloyalty and apathy amongst the RUC could have disastrous consequences and therefore it would seem important in the twilight period leading up to the outbreak of Protestant troubles to reinforce the RUC with GB non uniform specialists to improve their capability and to ensure their effectiveness is maintained during the difficult period when loyalties are strained. It is also important to bind the Regular Army to the RUC in integrated joint operations in the Protestant areas especially in Belfast and its environs.

17. The loyalty of the UDR has not really been tested as their operations have been directed towards the defeat of the IRA. 
several robberies of UDR guarded armouries and Key Points which clearly indicate an element of collusion. 
the UDR contain men who are members of militant Protestant organizations and many who sympathise with their aims. 
Since the Protestants started to re-arm there have been Undoubtedly, The 
known cases (about 38, but the total is probably as high as 300) are being weeded out. 
However it is assumed that the 
majority of the UDR will remain loyal as widespread disloyalty amongst the UDR would probably indicate the provisions of the White Paper were unacceptable to the bulk of the Protestant population and therefore the situation would be outside the. scope of this paper. 
In the twilight period leading up to 
the publication of the White Paper, the UDR should be ’steeled’ in operations in Protestant areas integrated with those of the Regular Army and the RUC. 
In this way it should be possible 
to expose the apathetic/disloyal members and to minimise the effect of disaffections when the White Paper is published. 
Timing of the White Paper 18. It is recognised that the timetable of political events may well necessitate the publication of the White Paper before the Plebiscite takes place on 8th March. 
There is however 
little doubt that the reactions of Protestants to the White Paper are likely to present less problems to the Security Forces if the Plebiscite has already been held. 
Protestants are likely to be 
less sensitive to those provisions of the White Paper which will be unwelcome to them if it has been clearly demonstrated, by means of the long promised Plebiscite, that the Border is not at issue. 
Conversely, to hold the Plebiscite after the White 
Paper would be to turn the Plebiscite into an indirect means of ratifying the White Paper (despite the limited terms of the questions), and thereby to increase the likelihood that extremists would seek to sabotage that expression of opinion.

19. Any long delay beetween the endinG of political consultations and the publication of the White Paper could case a power vacuum which might have serious security implications, an extremists attempt to undermine public confidence and therefore should be avoided. 
Furthermore, the publication should be well before the emotive period of Easter. 
20. Unless the period between the publication of the White Paper and its enactment is kept to the minimum, extremists on both sides of the sectarian divide will be tempted to seek to influence public opinion and Parliament to alter or reject certain provisions in the White Paper. 
This could result in a 
serious escalation of violence which a quick enactment might avoid. 
Neither the Catholic nor Protestant extremists are 
likely to desist until all possible hope of influencing events has gone and they are deprived of public support. 
As already 
stated, the Catholics are unlikely to withdraw their total support before they are convinced the White Paper has been enacted and accepted by the Protestant majority. 
Information Policy 21. The Protestant militants will probably endeavour to alienate moderate Protestant opinion from supporting HMG by declaring the White Paper proposals to be unacceptable and by staging incidents to depict the British Army as the suppressors of loyal Protestants. Any attempt by the Army to pre-empt Protestant militancy by a large scale pre-emptive arrest operation or the flooding of Protestant areas with troops, could quickly become counterproductive as the Protestant population would consider such action to be repressive. 
This could result in welding the Protestants 
against HMG. Thus action by the Army should be in response to Protestant inspired trouble and as far as possible Ulster Protestant militants should be confronted with Ulster Security Forces (e.g. the RUC/Army/UDR acting in unison whenever it is tactically possible).

Information Policy should seek to depict

22. Clearly, everyting possible should be done to discredit 
and erode the pubio standing of military Protestant leaders before the publication of the White Paper. 
Experience has 
shown that thin is more easily achieved when the Army are involved in operations against their activities than when the RUC are operating alone. 
23. Even when Protestant violence has erupted, from a counterpropaganda viewpoint, it is important to avoid embarking on any operations which could be seen to be generally repressive and indiscriminate. 
Any large scale arrest operations, the 
flooding of Protestant areas with troops acting on their own, indiscriminate search and screening operations could quickly become counter-productive unless their need is clearly 
recognised by the public. But operations seen to be selective and based on good information would be welcomed by the public on both sides. The Implications of Launchin g the Army against the Militan t Protestants 
24. The mere deployment of troops into Protestant areas may not necessarily create the conditions for a peaceful acceptance of the White Paper by the Protestant population. 
Initially, 
their presence may create a period of calm especially if they have been deployed to quell UDA or Tartan gang street rioting, but because there are now so many guns in the hands of extremists this will inevitably lead to an armed confrontation between the Army and Protestant extremists and casualties to both sides. The Army would then become engaged in a protracted campaign of attrition against militant Protestants which would lead to the adoption of tactics similar to those used successfully against the IRA, such as:a. 
b. 
High intensity patrolling of Protestant areas. The conduct of largo numbers of house and vehicle 
searches. c. 
The mass screening of the population in Protestant 
areas to gather the basic intelligence on which to conduct more selective operations against extremist elements.

25. The extent to which these tactics will have to be used will depend primarily upon the support the Army receives from If, as seems likely at preent, the RUC adopts 
the RUC. 
on attitude of apathy without openly refusing to do their duty, the Army could be forced increasingly to operate alone. 
Even so, its efforts could be rendered nugatory 
by an RUC failure to interrogate and proceed against suspects and those persons arrested by the Army. 
Thus, the attitude 
of the RUC will be crucial to the success of military operations which emphasises the importance of ensuring that non-uniformed GB police specialists are inserted into the RUC ranks before the likely outbreak of serious Protestant violence. 
26. Although the Republican campaign of violence has shown signs of faltering, it is likely to continue to receive Catholic support until a settlement with the Protestants is reached and accepted by them. 
are capable of maintaining a high level of violence. 
Official IRA are known to be a more formidable and better organised force. 
A resumption of violence by them could have 
serious security implications which would require higher force levels in the Catholic areas. 27. The Protestant extremists seem determined to resort to force unless HMG accede to the majority of their legislative demands. Many Protestants sympathise with these extremist’s views although the majority will probably remain apathetic until the outcome becomes clearer. 
There is likely to be some disaffection 
amongst the RUC and UDR which could have serious security implications if both forces are not bolstered by the Regular Army and some GB plain clothes police specialists in the period leading up to the publication of the White Paper. 28. The provisions of the White Paper are less likely to be emotive to Protestants if they are published after the promised Border Poll has been held and the Border is no longer an issue. The period between the publication and enactment of the White Paper will probably be most turbulent and should be kept as short as possible. 
As recent events have shown, the Provisionals The

29. The deployment of troops into Protestant areas will inevitably lead to an armed confrontation between the Army and extremist Protestants and a campaign of attrition against Protestant militants. 
The Army’s efforts to deal with 
Protestant extremists can be nullified by the non-cooperation or apathy of the RUC. 
Past experience of large scale arrest 
operations directed against one section of the community or large scale pre-emptive action by the Army is very likely to weld Protestant opinion against the Army, as such acts might appear to be repressive and indiscriminate. 
These dangers are 
minimised if Ulster Protestant extremists are confronted by Ulster Security Forces. 30. However, in these circumstances we might well soon reach a point where, should political negotiations fail to provide a halt to the violence, the Army could find itself faced with a protracted and open-ended campaign of attrition against extremist organisations shielded by a large proportion of the Protestant population. 
serious than anything we have yet faced in Northern Ireland. POSSIBLE SCENARIOS 
General 31. There are a large number of different ways in which the Provisionals, Officials and extremist Protestants could react to the publication of the White Paper. 
In our examination 
of the possible scenarios the following two are considered to be the most likely. Scenario A 32. This envisages a situation in which: a. 
The Provisional IRA have continued their campaign 
throughout the period leading up to the publication of the White Paper and oppose its provisions. 
Their ability 
to create violence has been further diminished and more emphasis has been placed on hooliganism. b. 
The military implications would be more 
The Officials have maintained their truce and resort to arms only if the Catholic areas are threatened.

To guard KPs (and possibly Stormont), two additional battalions. 
47. General. There are three periods during which Security 
Forces action can be taken against the extremist organisations (in both sectarian groups). These periods are: a. 
Before the White Paper is published. b. After it is published but before th outbreak 
of serious Protestant violence. c. 
After the outbreak of serious Protestant violience.

d. Deployment of three battalions and possibly a brigade headquarters into 
Protestant areas of Belfast. 
c. Commencement of joint RUC/Army/UDR operations in Protestant areas in response to extremist activity. f. 
50. The advantages of this course are that: a. 
Continuance of Army operations against the Provisional IRA whilst controlling the interface areas. 
It avoids the danger of leaving the RUC to operate 
alone in circumstances which could affect their morale, shake their loyalty and weaken them before the crisis. It will allow the Army firmly to identify itself with the RUC. b. 
It may enable the Security Forces to improve the 
state of security in Protestant areas, introduce an element of calm in them and increase public confidence. 
This 
may lead to some successful operation which could erode the militant organisations and discredit them in the eyes of the general public, which could seriously degrade their eventual chance of launching successfully a terrorist campaign. c. 
It will enable the Army to build up intelligence 
about the militant Protestants and their activities before the outbreak of Protestant violence. d. 
The introduction of non-uniform GB police specialists 
to ease the load on the RUC could re-establish the principle of help being provided by GB police before the White Paper formalises such attachments. 
e. If the Plebiscite is held before the White Paper is 
published, and if an increase of violence in Protestant areas has not previously necessitated the input of reinforcements, they would be deployed for security duties for the Plebiscite.

Recommended Course post White Paper and Protestant Violence (Course Twenty) 
54. This course envisages the following measures being adopted after the publication of the White Paper and after the outbreak of Protestant extremist violence:- 
a. b. 
c. 
The proscribing of selected militant organisations. A selective arrest policy against militant Protestants. The continuance of a strong information policy campaign to discredit 
the extremist Protestants (conducted from London and Stormont). d. 
Reinforcement of the Province by a further ten 
battalions for Scenario A or twelve battalions for Scenario B to a total in the Province of 28 or 30 battalions respectively. 
e. Maintenance of the principle of joint RUC/Army operations in Protestant areas. 
55. The advantages are: a. 
It is the minimum response to a campaign of 
violence by both the Protestant extremists and IRA, and therefore should not appear to be unduly repressive. b. 
It should provide the forces necessary to control the 
Protestant areas and erode the militant organisations, provided the militants do not receive the general support of the moderate Protestant community. 
56. The disadvantages are: a. 
Reinforcement cannot be implemented until Protestant 
violence starts and then it would take approximately 72 hours to complete. 
By which time the situation in Belfast would 
have become very grave and units already in the City would have become greatly overstretched and tired.

(1) ztremist ation could have ser.tously eroded public confidence and caused widespread disaffeotion in the RUC and UDR. (2) A demoralised RUC might refuse to cooperate with the Army and thus force it to operate independently and so breech the principle of Ulster Protestant extremists being confronted by Ulster Seourity Forces. (3) New Army units would need four weeks to become operationally fully effective, (4) The Army would not have had time to build-up tactical intelligence of the Protestant areas. (5) Information!Policy objootives to discredit Protestant extremists and to depict the British Army operating with the RUC against the oxtremints would be 3 more difficult to attain. 
PIAN Recommended Course of Action 
57. It is considered that the best prospects for success are offered by adopting the measures recommended in Course Four before the White Paper is published and by adopting the measures recommended in Course Twenty after the White Paper is published and after widespread Protestant violence commences.

is an open defiance of areas must be conducted jointly with the RUC. 
Again, the Army’s operations in the hard Protestant Swift disciplinary 
action should be taken against any apathetic, disaffected policeman and vigorous action should be demanded from the force. 
All 
screening and census type operations to gather intelligence in the Protestant areas should be carried out by the RUC with the Army’s assistance. 
independently in "hard" Catholic areas until the population are prepared to accept 
police authority. 
61. However, if the action proposed above does not result quite quickly in a restoration of order in Protestant areas and the termination of the militant Protestant campaign, the Army will become committed to a long protracted campaign of attrition against the terrorists. 
This could result in a gradual breakdown in 
RUC morale or in attempts by them to neutralise the Army’s actions which in turn will lead to the Army having to adopt the independent tactics used against the IRA. 
Such operations 
may lead to increased hostility amongst the Protestant population. Force Levels 62. The force level requirement necessary to implement this plan is given in Annex C. 
In outline the Regular Army force 
levels will need to be increased as follows in the event of Scenario A occurring:a. 
Before the White Paper is Published (1) Force Troops 
- 
(2) 39 Brigade - three battalions Shankill and North Belfast. 
b.

68. Accomodation. This is not a restricting factor. Where suitable accomodation cannot be provided initially. sufficient tentage is held within the Provice to meet all likely requirements. Sufficient camp scales of accomodation sites are already held except that additional steel bunk beds 
and a limited range of cooking utensils may be required. CONCLUSIONS 
69. In the absence of a detailed assessment by DCI, intelligence at present available indicates there is a 
strong 
possibility that the publication of the White Paper will herald a serious outbreak of violence by Protestant extremists and the Provisional IRA, possibly supported by the Official IRA. Should this occur the loyalty of the RUC and UDR will be severely tested. 
Initially the bulk of the Protestant 
population is likely to be apathetic but possibly easily swayed against HMG’s legislative proposals. 
Extremists will 
endeavour to exploit the delicate situation by depicting the Army’s actions as being repressive,and a deliberate attempt to suppress loyalist Protestant views in an effort to impose an alien Westminster solution against the will of the population. 
70. The best counter to this would appear to be to: a. 
Discredit and erode the position of Protestant 
extremists before the White Paper is published, especially by adopting a major Information. Policy campaign from London and Stormont. 
b. Instil as much calm and confidence as possible in 
the Protestant areas of Belfast before the White Paper is published by deploying another three battalions. c. 
Accustom the public progressively to more joint 
RUC/Army operations in Protestant areas, in step with a deteriorating situation. d. 
Bolster the RUC by attaching non-uniformed GB 
specialists to them and binding the Army more close to them.

71. The best prospects of achieving success would seem to be 
provided by the adoption of the recomended plan of action. This involves the deployment of three extra battalions and 
possibly a brigade headquarters into Belfast in response to increased violence in Protestant areas before the White Paper is published or before the Plebiscite;and the deployment the whole Province of a further seven to nine battalions, an 
engineer squadron and one armoured car squadron immediately Protestant violence erupts. 
72. Once large numbers of troops have been deployed in Protestant areas, unless this results in a quick restoration of law and order, the Army may have to be prepared to conduct a long campaign of attrition against the terrorist organisations and to accept its consequent dangers. 
RECOMMENDATION 
73. It is recommended that a contingency plan on the lines indicated should be urgently prepared.

SITUATION a. 
General. Although the prospects for political progress 
are set fair by the recent agreement to establish a designate Executive, composed of members of the Alliance, SDLP and Unionist Parties, both the IRA and extreme Loyalists have declared their opposition to it and their intention to wreck it. If the recent agreement holds, it is to be hoped that progress will continue through the following developments: 
(1) (2) Talks between HMG, the Eire Government and the 
Executive (designate) towards the establishment of a Council of Ireland. 
Final agreement on the Executive, possibly before 
Christmas. (3) 
Devolution of powers to the Assembly and Executive 
by Westminster, possibly early in Jan 74. (4) 
early 1974. b. The Threat. The threat is described in Annex A and can 
be summarised as follows: (1) 
Although the UVF are considered most likely to 
maintain their ceasefire, there are 4 flashpoints in the short term when they, possibly assisted by other less extreme Protestant organisations, might resume their campaign of violence: 
(a) The announcement of the date for tripartite 
talks on a Council of Ireland, (b) 
Commencement of tripartite talks. Establishment of a Council of Ireland, possibly

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
(c) Successful completion of these talks/ 
establishment of a Council of Ireland. (d) 
(2) 1 Jan 74, the date announced by the UVF for the ending of their ceasefire. Violence would be most likely to take the form of 
assassination of political leaders and large scale bombing of RC property. It is possible but unlikely at this stage that the UVF might seek to provoke a civil war situation by determined attacks on RC ghettos. Some industrial unrest could be expected in Belfast. 
(3) When it first erupted, violence would probably be 
widespread and occur simultaneously in many areas. The campaign thereafter would be coordinated to a degree, might be sustained for 3 to 4 months and would not necessarily be confined to Belfast, Lisburn, Portadown, Lurgan and Armagh. 
(4) (5) (6) 
provide little active but some passive support for the extremists and street demonstrations might take place in response to the arrest of prominent terrorists. 
The Protestant community could be expected to RCs would consider themselves on the defensive and 
might turn to the OIRA and PIRA for defence, especially if SF protection proved ineffective. 
The period before a resurgence of Protestant violence 
can be considered as Phase 1; if violence occurred, from that moment until it was clear that the violence would be sustained can be considered as Phase 2; the period thereafter can be considered as Phase 3.

reinforcement (Op CHANTRY) of up to six IS bns is planned as follows: 
Phase 1. No reinforcements would be 
called forward in this phase unless tension rose significantly or good intelligence was received of imminent Protestant extremist violence. In that event it is hoped that one IS bn would be called forward under command 39 Inf Bde and concentrated in the MAIDSTONE. 
ii. Phase 2. Two IS bns (only one if the 
first was called forward in Phase 1) would be called forward immediately and deployed under comd 39 Inf Bde.

iii. Phase 3. An additional four IS bns would 
be available to be called forward if necessary once it became clear that the Protestant extremist violence was likely to be sustained. These bns would be deployed where necessary but at present are earmarked two for 39 Inf Bde and one each for 3 and 8 Inf Bdes. 
(c) UDR. A selective call-out of UDR will be authorised at Phase 2. MISSION. The Army is to assist the RUC to prevent or to stifle 
any significant outbreak of extremist Protestant violence, in addition to the general mission in Reference A. 
3. 
EXECUTION a. 
Concept of Operations (1) 
(a) Operations against Protestant extremists (Op UTMOST) 
must be governed by a number of principles, including the following: 
They must not generally be conducted at the 
expense of operations against the IRA. (b) 
They should be designed to avoid provoking 
a Protestant reaction or escalation, in particular a UDA call-out or generation of moderate Protestant opposition. 
(c) Protestant terrorism should ideally be 
prevented, or at least stifled quickly in order to avoid a resurgence of support for the OIRA and PIRA by the RC community. This might entail a pre-emptive arrest operation. 
(d) 
Arrests should generally be made only in the case of evidence sufficient to ensure a criminal 
prosecution or, failing that, the signing of an ICO; searches in Protestant areas should only be made on good intelligence. 
(2) Because the act of reinforcement itself could be 
provocative, it is intended not to call forward reinforcements during Phase 1, unless there is good intelligence to indicate an imminent outbreak of Protestant extremist violence. Should violence break out, up to two bns would be called forward in Phase 2 and a further four would be available if necessary at Phase 3. 
(3) 
there is likely to be a delay (about 24-48 hours) before Phase 2 reinforcements arrive. This is one of several reasons for a selective UDR call-out. If necessary, troops would be redeployed to Belfast, even at some risk, from 8 Inf Bde until reinforcements arrived. Similar action would have to be taken if violence broke out without warning during the period 8-29 Dec, when 1 DERR are on block leave, or good intelligence was received in Phase 1 that violence would break out in less than 24 hours, The outline contingency plan for an emergency redeployment in either of these circumstances is at Annex C. 
Should the violence occur without advanced warning,

UK EYES A b. c. Grouping. Annex D. All Bdes. In addition to the tasks and priorities in 
Reference A: (1) 
Phase 1. (Before Violence Erupts) (a) 
Continue a selective arrest policy against 
Protestant terrorists against whom evidence exists sufficient for criminal proceedings or the signing of ICOs. 
(b) Prepare, when ordered, to arrest simultaneously 
all those active Protestant terrorists who are known to be involved in bombing. (c) 
Continue selective searches for Protestant 
extremist arms, ammunition, explosive and equipment. (d) 
of political leaders and other prominent citizens. (e) 
Assist the RUC as requested with close protection In conjunction with the RUC identify areas where 
small unprotected RC communities live; maintain and, in response to intelligence, increase the confidence and protective patrolling of isolated RC communities. 
(f) (2) Be prepared to implement Op LINGO (Reference B) 
and to form similar stop lines to control movement out of Protestant areas. 
Phase 2. (Immediate Action on Violence Erupting). (a) 
searches on goad intelligence. (b) 
across all sectarian interfaces. (c) (d) 
Continue the policy of selective arrests and Increase the presence at, and control movement Implement Op LINGO for 72 hours. Increase the deployment of VCPs along planned 
stop lines to control movement out of Protestant areas. This could result in attempts by Protestant terrorists to direct their efforts against soft RC targets outside Belfast; bdes are to be prepared to counter this. 
(e) Implement a selective call-out of the UDR 
without use of the media. (f) 
Ambush likely targets of Protestant terrorist action, in order to inflict attrition.

Other Protestant extremist groups say commence extensive acts of terrorism and/or militant activity. 
Secondly, to assess the type and scale of activity that we may see Protestant extremists engage in at this time. CIRCUMSTANCES LIKELY TO PRODUCE EXTENSIVE PROTESTANT TERRORISM 8. 
There are of course a number of possible events over the next 2 months 
which could promote a significant change in the political end security situation. One of these, which could be almost catastrophic in its consequences, would be the assassination of Brian Faulkner. Having in mind that a situation which is impossible to predict could quickly develop there are apparently four dates over the next 2 months where extremist groups may decide to engage in major acts of terrorism: a. 
The announcement of a date for the beginning of tripartite talks 
on the Council of Ireland. b. 
c. 
Council of Ireland. d. 
ceasefire. 9. There is the additional complication that the tripartite talks which will 
take place in December are regarded as only the preliminary conference to the major meeting which will take place in January. How Protestant extremists view the December "talks about talks" will be very dependent on the type of publicity 
Actual commencement of tripartite talks. Successful completion of these talks and the establishment of a let January - the date the UVF have announced for the ending of their This Annex attempts, firstly, an assessment of the possible flashpoints

they receive. If the UVF does not resume hostilities on any of the above dates then the full Council of Ireland talks will be the next flash point. ORGANISATIONS LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED 10. Taking each of the 4 political flashpoints in turns a. 
Announcement of a Date for Beginning of Tripartite Talks There is the possibility that the UVF will act at this time since it 
could be interpreted as "moves towards a Council of Ireland". There are however 3 factors which could mitigate against a UVF resumption of hostilities at this date. Firstly, in their press statements they do allow for some form of "liaison" between North and South and the UVF leaders with sightly more political acumen may choose to hold off until the progress of the talks can be manifestly shown to be inimical to Protestant interests. Secondly these talks may be seen by the UVF as only "preliminary" in nature and therefore not the point at which to react in strength. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, Christmas is very close and the UV may Judge it politically inexpedient to bomb over this period and possibly alienate many sections of the Protestant community. There have been reports that militant elements in the LDV, VSC and OV have been planning for co-ordinated action on the date of this announcement. Having in mind the link at senior leadership level between the VSC and LAW there is also the possibility of industrial disruptive action by probably small groups of workers but engaged in sensitive economic areas such as electricity generation. Although as yet, we have no intelligence on the plans of the UDA in relation to the Council of Ireland the possibility of organised street demonstrations cannot be ruled out. b. 
Commencement of Tripartite Talks Similar conditions for the possibility of Protestant terrorism as at 
a. above except that we have no intelligence regarding the LDV/VSC/OV planning for action at this specific date. However assuming no action had been taken at a. this date does appear to be a likely tine for Protestant violence from

a publicity point of view. It would also be an easier date to plan for because of the prior notice from Governmental pronouncements. c. 
Successful Completion of Council of Ireland Talks As for b. we have no intelligence to indicate planning for terrorist 
action at this date but it is likely that almost any form of Council of Ireland established by the negotiations will be seen as alien to the interests of the Protestant community. The problem for the SF is judging whether or not completion of the preliminary talks in December will be viewed as sufficient provocation by the UVF. The nearness of Christmas may be the principle factor in staving off major Protestant violence. d. 
lst January If the UVF has not previously resumed its terrorist campaign by this 
date it is probable that they rill be forced to act to maintain their credibility. In addition if the December preliminary talks on the Council of Ireland have apparently made some progress, and it is indeed probable that unless there has been a total breakdown all parties will maintain that satisfactory progress has boon made, then the UVF will regard their demands for inter-departmental co-operation as not having been met and the resumption of bombing as justified. It is probable that the LDV/VSC/OV groups would also be involved in terrorism planned to coincide with the UVF actions. 
TYPE OF TERRORISM 11. We would expect mainly the use of bombs, usually in cars and often very large, directed at RC 
owned or associated property. Since the UVF has reportedly 
declared the intention of promoting a "civil war" (though not it is perhaps significant in its more cogently argued press statements) there is the possibility of indiscriminate bombing of RC 
areas to produce this situation. On 
balance we think the UVF is more likely, at least at this stage, to exercise some political judgement and hope to put pressure on HMG for a political solution more favourable to the Protestant community rather than attempt to produce an

almost "Doomsday" situation. The UHF just also be aware that such activity would produce massive reaction by SF. 12. When elements of the other groups 
- LDV/VSC/OV - are involved they may 
also engage in bombing and there is also evidence of plans for rural and border disruption in the form of road blocks, car hijackings etc. Possibly they are planning on the lines of the PIRA disruption of 25/26 October. 13. There is a distinct possibility of assassination attempts directed at leading Unionist and SDLP politicians and sons sectarian murders. The UVF however has announced that it does ot engage in this latter activity. 14. There is also the possibility of industrial unrest generated through the LAW. Among targets for this type of action would be Short Bros and Harland, Harland and Wolff and, most important, the electricity generating stations. 15. Operations against Security Forces, unless in ’self-defence’, would be unlikely at this stage. AREAS OF TERRORISM 16. Protestant extremists would probably concentrate on Belfast for the publicity value their attacks would gain also, in the past, the UVF has favoured the city for its operations. Other possible areas of UVF activity are Armagh, Lurgan, Portedown, East County Antrim and North County Down but all at a much lower level than Belfast. 17. For rural disruption by LDV/VSC/CV elements the potential trouble spots are the Clogher Valley, forth County Armagh, North County Down and East County Antrim. Industrial militancy would probably be concentrated in Belfast. CAPABILITIES 18. a. 
UVF The UVF has already demonstrated its ability to mount a co-ordinated 
intensive bombing campaign and there is no reason to doubt its ability to mount another wave of bombing end sustain this activity, although at a much lower level, for a considerable period. They would however be subject

SUPPORT FROM PROTESTANT POPULATION 
19. There would probably be only limited active support and we do not foresee any massive uprising by tho Protestant community or even major incursions into RC 
areas by large groups of Protestants. There is, however, the distinct 
possibility of passive support in the sense that many members of the Protestant community would be loath to inform on known terrorists. 20. Minor street disturbances could be expected, especially in "hard-core" East Belfast, if large numbers of Protestant extremists were arrested. The level of street violence may increase if wall-known Protestants are arrested. THE RELIABILITY OF THE RUC AND UDR 21. a. 
RUC The problem of subversion and divided loyalties in the RUC is a 
continuing one which the Army has to allow for in all its activities. It is extremely unlikely, however, that a sudden outbreak of bombing and/or rural disruption could produce mass disaffection in the force. On the contrary the vast majority of the RUC would react as "policemen" and attempt tO bring the situation under control. If extensive Protestant violence continue. over a longer period than pressures on the individual policemen, particularly in the rural areas and the Reserve, would increase. b. 
UDR Our assessment of subversion in the UDR has been "by the nature of its 
being, and the circumstances in which it operates, the Regiment is wide open to subversion and potential subversion". Although considerable comembership of Protestant extremist organisations and the UDR exists it is likely that a majority of those men have joined extremist organisations for the "Doomsday" situation which they would not regard any of the four flashpoints as having produced. There would of course be a considerable increase in the number of situations in which the UDR could not be used because of the danger of confrontation with Protestant extremists. 
Files\\DNV_round1\\DEFE 24 877\\IMG_1488_DEFE_24_877 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
These situations would be more prevalent in the areas listed at para 17. We would not, however, expect mass disaffection by the UDR. 
REACTIONS FROM REPUBLICAN GROUPS 22. Republican reactions would be very dependent on tho level of Protestant violence. If extreme the OIRA leaders would realise that they must ascert their presence at the very least by 
adopting a "community defender" role 
with vigilante patrols etc. The pressure from probably younger, more militant elements to react more harshly would be considerable. if the violence was contained the OIRA leadership would find it easier to control its headstrong members. 23. Extensive Protestant violence would strengthen the PIRA because the RC 
community could again see then as their "defenders". 
LONG TERM 24. The long term situation is, of course, very dependent on the successful functioning of the Assembly and Executive. Once off the ground these bodies will acquire a momentum of their own and when seen to be successful an increasing proportion of the Protestant community will come to accept poser sharing as an appropriate part of Northern Ireland’s political life. Protestant terrorism at a continued high level would restrict both the successful functioning of the Executive and its acceptance, together with the political developments associated with it, by the Protestant community would be seriously impaired. CONCLUSIONS 25. Protestant extremists, notwithstanding the UVF ceasefire, could engage in extensive terrorist activity at any time in the next 2 months particularly if the political and/or security situation were to radically alter. However in terms of probability there are 3 dates associated with preliminary talks on the Council of Ireland in the pr-Christmas. period where the UVF may resume terrorist activity. The UVF is capable of mounting a co-ordinated intensive bombing campaign probably centred on Belfast. The UVF may be joined in this action by

1105 G EXTREME PROTESTANT VIOLENCE INTRODUCTION 1. 
Both the IRA and extreme Loyalists have declared their 
opposition to the formation of an Executive, on which substantive agreement was reached on 21 November. While the PIRA campaign is likely to continue it is impossible to predict with any great certaintY the likely course of action to be taken by extreme Protestant groups. 
2. It is true to say that the political and security prognoses of 
only a month ago have been reversed; while the prospects. for political progress now seem to be encouraging, the dangers of a marked deterioration in the security situation could be considered very grave. 
AIM 3. 
To consider the nature, timing and likelihood of a campaign of 
violence by Protestant extremists and the best action to be taken by SF both to prevent and, if necessary, to stop such a campaign. 
THE THREAT 4. 
5. An intelligence assessment is at Annex B. 
The threat to security can be summarised as follows: a. 
The extreme Loyalists’ opposition to the Assembly and 
Executive must be taken seriously. The UVF’s recent bombing campaign demonstrated for the first time the emergence of a Protestant terrorist organisation capable of coordinated terrorist

action for political purposes. b. 
Although the UVF is most likely to maintain their 
ceasefire (see statements at Annex A), there are considered to be four ’flashpoints’ in the short term when they might decide to resume their campaign of violence: 
(1) The announcement of a date for the beginning 
of tripartite talks on the Council of Ireland. (2) ’Commencement of tripartite talks. (3) 
establishment of a Council of Ireland. (4) 
1 January 1974 - UVF for the ending of their ceasefire. c. It is most probable that violence would take the form of 
assassination of prominent politicians (the assassination of Mr. Faulkner could be catastrophic) and an extensive campaign of car bombing of RC property. Although not assessed at this stage as likely, Protestant terrorists might engage in determined attacks on RC ghettos; if other less militant organisations than the UVF became involved, there would be a distinct danger of civil war. Some industrial unrest could be expected in Belfast. 
d. A degree of coordination of effort could be expected of 
the Protestant campaign. Numbers involved cannot be accurately assessed but are unlikely to exceed 1500. If organisations other than UVF were involved, the campaign could be sustained for at least 3 to 4 months (depending on SF attrition) and might not

The prinip1 constraints on SF counter action are as follows: a. 
Protestant violence must not be allowed to reach such 
intensity that the OIRA breaks its ceasefire or that the PIRA is significantly strengthened by recruits wishing to ’defend’ 
-RC areas. b. 
SF action must not be so vigorous that it provokes a 
Protestant reaction leading to a call-out di the UDA or to the use of firearms against Republicans or the SF. 
PREMRV TATTVE ITASURES 7, 
Before violence erupts, SF are not as free to act against the Protestant terrorist organisations as they would be once a capan. o; 
Files\\DNV_round1\\DEFE 24 877\\IMG_1504_DEFE_24_877 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
violence had demonstrably started. There are a number of reasons, as follows: 
a. Hard intelligence, sufficient under current rules to lead 
to the signing of ICOs or to criminal charges, exists on only about 25 prominent Protestant terrorists. Arrests, followed by release for insufficient evidence, would be counter-productive and provocative. 
b. Large scale searches of houses would, for similar reasons, 
prove more provocative than productive. c. 
SSNI is now committed to the release of some detainees 
from the Maze and to an increase in those paroled before Christmas. Since the majority of those released and paroled are likely to be RCs (if only because there are fewer Protestant detainees), invidious comparisons could be drawn between the release of IRA men on the one hand and the arrest of Loyalists on the other. 
d. HMG and the SF have consistently maintained a public 
attitude in which the IRA is considered the primary target and Protestant terrorism has tended to be minimised. An extensive pre-emptive campaign before violence began in earnest could be difficult if not impossible to justify. 
e. It is possible at this stage to say that current force 
levels (due to reduce to 16 major units by 1 December) would not permit an extensive operation in Protestant areas without either significant redeployment from RC areas or some reinforcement by MOD. This aspect is considered more fully at paragraphs 12 to 
8. 
For all these reasons, therefore, it is considered that SF action before violence breaks out should seek to:

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
a. Deter extremists and their supporters from a campaign of 
violence by (1) 
Selective arrests of those against whom criminal 
charges could be brought or 100 signed, at the most opportune moment. 
(2) Selective searches for arms and ammunition based on 
good intelligence. (3) 
b. Very close protection of political leaders. Maintain the pressure on the PIRA, in order to reduce 
still further the credibility of Protestant fears. c. 
Bolster the confidence of the RC population that HMG and 
the SF can and would provide its only effective protection; to this end, the SF presence in RC areas and cover of sensitive RC targets should be maintained. 
d. Limit the movement of terrorists, arms and explosives, as 
soon as clear intelligence of impending violence is available, by imposing Op LINGO on the River Bann. 
COUNTER MEASURES 9. 
Once Protestant extremists begin a campaign of violence, the 
options for SF counter action are wider. At that moment, the professions of Loyalist leaders that they would seek the downfall of the Executive and Assembly by legitimate democratic processes would be open to IP attack; by the same token, SF operations Would be justifiable as impartial and designed to preserve law and order. One important constraint would remain, however; it would still be

by 1 December to 16 major unite. There are three otber major factors a hic must be tojen into accont in consideration of force levels, as follows: 
a. Province Reserve. 1 DER was due to take block leave from 
20 December to C January. It has now been decided to alter this to the period 9-30 December so that the bn comrplete is availablat1 January. It does mean, however that, the force level ill in fact be down to 15 major units for the last 21 days of Pecembar. 
b. Reinforcement. A reinforcement of Northern Ireland must 
always be carefully considered in order to deter.mine the relative importance of having sufficient troops available in tit to deal with expected trouble on the one hard and of not 
’ exaerbating a difficult situation by the very act of reinforcement on the other. The former depends greatly upont intelligence assessment of the threat, while the latter depend upon the prevailing political climate.

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
c. Redeployment. It is clear that no significant 
redeployment of troops from RC to Protestant areas could be contemplated either before or after a campaign of Protestant violence began. Not only must the current pressure on the PIRA be maintained (for which the current force level and deployment is considered barely adequate) but there would be an enhanced nee to boost RC confidence and cover likely RC targets. However, on past experience we cannot guarantee sufficient advanced warning of the outbreak of Protestant violence; we should be prepared, therefore, to react quickly to reinforce Belfast, if necessary at the expense of 3 and 8 Inf Bdes until he necessary reinforcements arrive from GB or BAR. 
13. 
39 Inf Bde a. 
Before Violence. It is considered that, although Belfast 
is the area where most Protestant terrorism originates and takes place, in view of the need only for selective, relatively lowprofile action before a campaign of violence began, the force level of 61/2 major units (1 December) would be sufficient. If the political situation, level of tension and intelligence justified it, a reinforcement of one bn to Belfast held at immediate readiness in Maidstone would be a prudent measure, which might calm fears and demonstrate our intention to maintain law and order. 
b. Once Violence Began. It is considered that, once Protestant 
violence began, 39 Inf Bde would need an immediate reinforcement of two bns, one for East Belfast, the other for North Belfast. Should the Protestant campaign appear likely to continue for several months, the bde might need up to two more bns, a second

in an emergency situation and thus forestall public criticism which might arise if the UVF partially succeeded in bombing some isolated

Summary a. 
estates. 
The total reinforcement would therefore be as follows: (1) 
Two bns required immediately after violence 
began for deployment to 39 Inf Bde. If the developing situation warranted it, one of these should be concentrated in the MAIDSTONE before the violence began. 
(2) Pour bns required at short notice for deployment 
two to 39 Inf Bde and one each to 3 and 8 Inf Bdes once it became clear that violence would be sustained. 
(3) b. Selective call out of the UDR until reinforcements arrived, 
An outline reinforcement plan, based on D-Day as the day on which violence breaks out, is at Annex C.

Executive are likely to increase the threat of Protestant extremist violence. The scope, duration and extent of such a campaign, together with the date it would begin, cannot be accurately forecast but it is considered most likely to 
start in January 1974, to involve the 
UVF and possibly some other less extreme Protestant organisations and to be directed primarily at bombing of RC property and assassination of political leaders. 
19. For a variety of reasons the scope of preventative action by SF 
against Protestant extremists is severely limited; it is essential that violence should not be provoked by SF action and, once it has broken out, should be contained and not allowed to escalate in degree or in extent. 
20. Before it was clear that Protestant violence had erupted on a 
significant scale, SF action should be aimed at removing the prominent terrorists, their arms and explosives by selective arrests and searches based on good intelligence. It would be important at this stage to continue the attrition of the PIRA and build up the RC community’s confidence in the SF. Very close protection of political leaders would also be essential. No increase in force levels would probably be necessary or desirable at this stage. 21.. Once violence had broken out, however, an immediate increase in force levels by two bns for Belfast and a selective call out of the UDR would be essential. The level of SF activity against Protestant terrorists would rise, but remain responsive to the need to avoid provoking greater violence or support for the extremists. 22. 
It is possible that the already acute prison staffing problem 
in Northern Ireland could be worsened by the arrest of Protestant terrorists in larger numbers than now, notwithstanding the possible

DATED 27 NOV 73 PROTESTANT EXTREMISTS - THE THREAT 
CURRENT SITUATION 1. 
the majority of recent bomb attacks on ’soft’ 
The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) is believed to have boon responsible for targets. They have 
RC 
declared a ceasefire until 1st January and have outlined a programme of their demands for a political solution which would satisfy them. 2. 
The UVF have stated that "any moves leading to the establishment of a 
Council of Ireland will automatically lead to the UVF ceasefire being terminated". They do, however, in their press statements allow for some contact or "liaison" between the governments of the North and South of Ireland. 3. 
We expect the UVF to keep their ceasefire but it is possible that the UFF 
(the Ulster Freedom Fighters - a group of extreme militants within the UDA) may continue attacks on 
RCs and RC property despite the UVF’s 
expressed disapproval of such actions during their ceasefire. 4. 
There have been extensive meetings of leaders of the slightly loss extreme Protestant groups - the Loyalist Defence Volunteers (LDV), Vanguard Service 
Corps(VSC) and Orange Volunteers (OV) - here discussion and planning for co-ordinated terrorist activity has taken place. 5. A prominent member of the LDV and VSC is also a leader in the Loyalist Association of Workers (LAW) and could conceivably utilise this latter position in an attempt to create industrial unrest. 6. 
the extremist elements in the LDV/VSC/OV with those of the UVF it is unlikely that the extremists of the former are totally unaware of the activities of the latter. Because of reported contacts between the UVF and the other groups we must assume that they could agree to strike together on a prearranged date. We also believe that William Craig is kept informed of the activities of the LDV/VSC/OV and possibly, but this is less certain, of the UVF. We have no 
While there is no evidence of extensive co-ordination of the activities of

evidence that he gives direction to their operations but he may well be in the position to switch them on or off, dependent on political considerations. 7. 
This Annex attempts, firstly, an assessment of the possible flashpoints 
over the next 2 months where: a. 
b. The UVF may break its ceasefire. 
Other Protestant extremist groups may commence extensive acts of terrorism and/or militant activity. 
Secondly, to assess the type and scale of activity that we may see Protestant extremists engage in at this time. CIRCUMSTANCES LIKELY TO PRODUCE EXTENSIVE PROTESTANT TERRORISM 8. There are of course a number of possible events over the next 2 months which could promote a significant change in the political and security situation. One of these, which could be almost catastrophic in its consequences, would be the. assassination of Brian Faulkner. Having in mind that a situation which is impossible to predict could quickly develop there are apparently four dates over the next 2 months where extremist groups may decide to engage in major acts of terrorism: a. 
The announcement of a date for the beginning of tripartite talks 
on the Council of Ireland. b. 
c. 
Council of Ireland. d. 
ceasefire. 9. There is the additional complication that the tripartite talks which will 
take place in December are regarded as only the preliminary conference to the major meeting which will take place in January. How Protestant extremists view the December "talks about talks" will be very dependent on the type of publicity

almost "Doomsday" situation. The UVF must also be aware that such activity would produce massive reaction by SF. 12. When elements of the other groups 
- LDY/VSC/OV - are involved they may 
also engage in bombing and there is also evidence of plans for rural and border disruption in the form of road blocks, car hijackings etc. Possibly they are planning on the lines of the PIRA disruption of 25/26 October. 13. There is a distinct possibility of assassination attempts directed at leading Unionist and DL politicians and some sectarian murders. The UVF however has announced that it does not engage in this latter activity. 14. There is also the possibility of industrial unrest generated through the LAW. Among targets for this type of action would be Short Bros and Harland, Harland and Wolff and, most important, the electricity generating stations. 15. Operations against Security Forces, unless in ’self-defence’, would be unlikely at this stage. AREAS OF TERRORISM 16. Protestant extremists would probably concentrate on Belfast for the publicity value their attacks would gain also, in the past, the UVF has favoured the city for its operations. Other possible areas of UVF activity are Armagh, Lurgan, Portadown, East County Antrim and North County Down but all at a much lower level than Belfast. 17. For rural disruption by LDV/VSC/OV elements the potential trouble spots are the Clogher Valley, North County Armagh, North County Down and East County Antrim. Industrial militancy would probably be concentrated in Belfast. CAPABILITIES 18. a. 
UVF The UVF has already demonstrated its ability to mount a co-ordinated 
intensive bombing campaign and there is no reason to doubt its ability to mount another wave of bombing and sustain this activity, although at a uch lower level, for a considerable period. They would however be subject

SUPPORT FROM PROTESTANT POPULATION 
19. There would probably be only limited active support and we do not foresee any massive uprising by the Protestant community or oven major incursions into RC 
areas by large groups of Protestants. There is, however, the distinct 
possibility of passive support in the sense that many members of the Protestant community would be loath to inform on known terrorists 20. Minor street disturbances could be expected, especially in "hrd-core" East Belfast, if large numbers of Protestant extremists were arrested. The level of street violence may increase if well-known Protestants are arrested. THE RELIABILITY OF THE RUC AND UDR 21. a. 
RUG The problem of subversion and divided loyalties in the RUC is a 
continuing one which the Army has to allow for in all its activities. It is extremely unlikely, however, that a sudden outbreak of bombing and/or rural disruption would produce mass disaffection in the force. On the contrary the vast majority of the RUC would react as "policemen" and attempt to bring the situation under control. If extensive Protestant violence continued over a longer period then pressures on the individual policemen, particularly in the rural areas and the Reserve, would increase. b. 
UDR Our assessment of subversion in the UDR has been "by the nature of its 
being, and the circumstances in which it operates, the Regiment is wide open to subversion and potential subversion". Although considerable comembership of Protestant extremist organisations and the UDR exists it is likely that a majority of these men have joined extremist organisations for the "Doomsday" situation which they would not regard any of the four flashpoints as having produced. There would of course be a considerable increase in the number of situations in which the UDR could not be used because of the danger of confrontation with Protestant extremists.

These situations would be more prevalent in the areas listed at para 17. We would not, however, expect mass disaffection by the UDR. 
REACTIONS FROM REPUBLICAN GROUPS 22. Republican reactions would be very dependent on the level of Protestant violence. It extreme the OIRA leaders would realise that they must assert their presence at the very least by adopting a "community defender" role with vigilante patrols etc. The pressure from probably younger, more militant elements to react more harshly would be considerable. if tho violence was contained the OIRA leadership would 
find it easier to control its headstrong 
members. 23. Extensive Protestant violence would strengthen the PIRA because the RG 
community would again see them as their "defenders". 
LONG TERM 24. The long term situation is, of course, very dependent on the successful functioning of the Assembly and Executive. Once off the ground those bodies will acquire a momentum of their own and when seen to be successful an increasing proportion of the Protestant community will come to accept power sharing as an appropriate part of Northern Ireland’s political life. Protestant terrorism at a continued high level would restrict both the successful functioning of the Executive and its acceptance, together with the political developments associated with it, by the Protestant community would be seriously impaired. CONCLUSIONS 25. Protestant extremists, notwithstanding the UVF ceasefire, could engage in extensive terrorist activity at any time in the next 2 months particularly if the political and/or security situation were to radically alter. However in terms of probability there are 3 dates associated with preliminary talks on the Council of Ireland in the pre-Christmas period where the UVF may resume terrorist activity. Tho UVF is capable of mounting a co-ordinated intensive bombing campaign probably centred on Belfast. The UVF may be joined in this action by B-8

Prime Minister 1. 
The GOC Northern Ireland, with the agreement of the 
Director and Coordinator of Intelligence, has recommended that, in view of the possibility of a major outbreak of violence by Protestant Extremists connected with the preliminary talks on the formation of a Council of Ireland during the coming weeks, the Spearhead battalion should be placed at a reduced notice of 24 hours as from midday Monday 3 December, and that a further unit should be brought to 72 hours notice from the same date. 
2. CGS and I both believe that this recommendation should be accepted. [The S of S(NI) has also been consulted and agrees.] 
I have accordingly approved that the necessary instructions be issued. I believe that you and our other colleagues in Gen 79 will wish to be aware of this. 
3. We have always recognised that once instructions for notice 
to be reduced in this way have been issued, it is fairly likely that the fact will become public knowledge. I consider however and Secretary of State(NI) agrees that it should not be unduly difficult to explain this action as a sensible precautionary measure similar to those taken at the time of the Elections earlier in the year.

Q.11. How about accommodation in NI used by the Army? 
A.11. Some may be surplus to requirements. Decisions will be taken as soon as possible. The use of others may diminish/increase to take account of the redeployment. 
Q.12. How will RUC/RMP attached to RUC be used? A.12. This is for the Chief Constable to decide. Q.13. 1000 reduction out of 16,500 sounds a lot. Is it? 
A.13. The regular Army is only part of the SF. You must remember the 4,300 RUC, RUC Reservists, and 8,300 in UDR. You must also remember the extra RMP Regiment and the increased use of the Army province reserve on routine security duties. 
Q.14. The Para unit due (7 Para RHA) will not now come. Is this significant? 
A.14. No. Para units will continue to serve in NI as and when their turn comes up and dependent upon other Army commitments. 
Q.15. How frequently will units now have to serve in NI? A.15. Obviously less frequently which is welcome. Q.16. How about Londonderry and the rural areas? 
A.16. No change at this time. The situation will be kept under constant review. 
Q.17. Does all this mean we are winning? 
A.17. We carefully avoid all claims of winning or victories. Progress over the past few months has been very satisfactory and the reduction is possible because of this. It is inevitable that there may be some terrorists who will make a gesture as this plan is implemented to try and convince the public otherwise, but we hope that the people of Northern Ireland overall will see this reduction as a hopeful sign and as being one step nearer to the return to normality.

DRAFT MINUTE FROM SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE PRIME MINISTER You will recall that at the Gen 79 meeting held on 12th July the 
the CGS and I expressed our concern about the effect on the Army of maintaining the existing Northern Ireland force level. We explained the cumulative severity of the penalties involved; and we described how we hoped that it would be possible for the present level of 18 Major units in the infantry role to be reduced to 16 during the autumn, to 14 by the end of December and to 12 by about next Easter. The Committee fully accepted the case for such reductions and agreed that we should begin to plan for them, but that complete secrecy must be maintained for the time being and there should be further consultation in September before any action was taken which might become public. 2. 
We have now re-examined the matter. I am in no doubt that the 
penalties of maintaining the present force level are still as serious ry as they appeared in July and will become increasingly so. From this point of view, the argument for seeking a reduction is no less strong. Meanwhile the intense pressure maintained by the Security Forces against the terrorists since Operation Motorman has clearly brought about a considerable improvement in the security situation. The pressure must be maintained but, for the reasons to which I have referred, I am anxious not to keep the force level any higher than is strictly necessary for the task. Implementation of the planned

reductions would in no way affect the availability of units in Britain and in Germany to reinforce Northern Ireland at short notice; experience has shown that it helps to keep the temperature down, as well as to lessen turbulence for the Army, if the reserves are held

You will recall that at the Gen 79 meeting held on 12th July 
the then CGS and I expressed our concern about the effect on the Army of maintaining the existing Northern Ireland force level. We explained the cumulative severity of the penalties involved; and we described how we hoped that it would be possible for the present level of 18 major units in the infantry role to be reduced to 16 during the autumn, to 14 by the end of December and to 12 by about next Easter. The Committee fully accepted the case for such reductions and agreed that we should begin to plan for them, but that complete secrecy must be maintained for the time being and there should be further consultation in September before any action was taken which might become public. 
We have now re-examined the matter. I am in no doubt that 
the penalties of maintaining the present force level are still as serious as they appeared in July and will become increasingly so. From this point of view, the argument for seeking a reduction is no less strong. Meanwhile the intense pressure maintained by the security forces against the terrorists since Operation Motorman has clearly brought about a considerable improvement in the security situation and I am advised that, in the cities at least, an increasing proportion of such trouble as continues to occur is essentially criminal in its nature and requires a police as much as a military approach. I fully appreciate that the RUC is still heavily dependent on the Army and will remain so for some time to come - though I hope that the steps which you are taking to strengthen its leadership will begin to have a positive effect quite soon. I hope too that the extra regiment of RMP now being formed will help very substantially to reinforce the RUC’s capability. 
None of this means that I have any illusions about the readi- 
ness of the various extremist groups to rebuild their strength if the pressure on them were reduced radically in the short term. My point is simply that, for the reasons I have mentioned, I am most reluctant to keep the force level any higher than is necessary.

ness of the various extremist groups to rebuild their strength if the pressure on them were reduced radically in the short term. My point is simply that, for the reasons I have mentioned, I am most reluctant to keep the force level any higher than is necessary. 
I need hardly add that implementation of the planned 
reductions would in no way affect our willingness to hold units ready in Britain and Germany to reinforce Northern Ireland a notice, at all times and particularly at times when the possibility of trouble is high. The experience of the recent elections in Northern Ireland appears to lend weight to the view that there is much to be gained, in terms of keeping the temperature down - as well as, of course, lessening turbulence for the Army - by holding the reserves in Britain and Germany rather than on the spot. 
T I appreciate that you will not wish to commit yourself at 
this point to the second and third stages of the plan, but I hope you can agree now to the first stage, which the GOC considers would permit the necessary operational pressure to be maintained. Obviously the simplest way to effect reductions is not to replace units whose tours in Northern Ireland are due to end at the time in question: my hope is that we need not replace 20 Medium Regiment when they leave on about 25 October and 25 Engineer Regiment when they leave on about 28 November. Nothing illustrates better our case for making the reductions than the fact that, if 20 Medium Regiment do have to be replaced, it will be by 7 Para RHA; this

PEACETIME STRUCTURE FOR THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND Reference: A: 
HQ Northern Ireland 1060 G of 1 Aug 73. 1. Attached are copies of Reference A, a paper by Headquarters Northern Ireland 
on the Peacetime Structure for the Army in Northern Ireland. 2. 
Whilst it is difficult to look forward from the present very high force 
levels in Northern Ireland to a time of normality and peace, and to decide what force level will be required, there can be little doubt that the scars and hatreds engendered by the last four years of violence will leave the possibility of sudden outbursts of rioting and terrorism. A peacetime garrison of one brigade headquarters, one armoured reconnaissance regiment and two infantry battalions which existed in 1968 will not be sufficient to meet this threat. The paper assesses the size and organisation of the force which will be required and recommends that: 
a. long term improvements to existing barracks and quarters should be set in hand 
b. planning of new barracks and quarters should start c. negotiations for new training areas should be entered into. 
3. 4. These all take time to achieve and it is wise to decide the matter as early 
as possible so that works and agreements can be complete in good time for the eventual rundown of the force. 
Since the proposal involves a major redeployment and the expenditure of large 
sums of money we see that a paper based on the Northern Ireland proposal will have to be submitted to SCAO, SCODA and, perhaps, the Army Board for agreement. I would be grateful therefore for your comments on the existing document, for resulting inputs to the proposed paper, and for your advice on its future handling. 
Please will you arrange such further distribution as you consider necessary. I would be grateful for replies by 14 September 1973.

PEACETIME STRUCTURE OF THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND INTRODUCTION 
BACKGROUND 1. 
Following the successful conduct of the Local Government and Assembly 
Elections, a start has been made with political negotiations aimed at establishing a workable Assembly and Executive. Although certain extreme Protestant elements continue to express their determination to wreck the proposals of HMG’s White Paper, and the Provisional IRA continues its campaign of violence, there are encouraging signs that the majority of the community is tired of violence and keen to pursue its political aspirations by democratic means. 
2. peaceful conditions in Northern Ireland. 
It must now be hoped that there will be a gradual return to more The degree of normality which 
eventually exists will depend on many factors including: a. 
Assembly and Executive. b. 
The successful establishment of a workable Northern Ireland The policy and capability of extremist organizations. 
c. The ability of the RUC to assume full responsibility for law enforcement throughout the Province. 
AIM 3. The aim of this paper is to recommend a peacetime structure for the Army 
in Northern Ireland. ASSUMPTIONS 4. 
It is assumed that: a. 
majority of the community rejects terrorism, 
The developing trend towards peace in which an increasing will gain momentum. 
Such lawlessness as is sustained will become progressively within the capacity of the RUC to control.

(2) The world in general is experiencing a period of increasing terrorism when subversives throughout the Western and uncommitted countries 
prepared to exploit 
traditional antagonisms. At the least, therefore training and propaganda support is likely to be available to the IRA from outside sources, to help them restart and then maintain violence as a political weapon whenever the situation is favourable. 
(3) It is clear that tension, occasionally erupting as incidents, is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. 
b. RC Community. No matter how marked or general may be the RC 
community’s rejection of IRA violence, there is likely to remain an element within that community which is implacably and historically opposed to the British connection and accustomed to violence as a means of demonstrating its conviction. This element could numerically be strengthened if former detainees wore released under the Emergency Provisions Bill review procedure. There is little prospect of change in the IRA’s long term aim to reunify Ireland by any means including force, except when a ceasefire appears at the time to be more expedient. Should the Republicans’ voice in the new Assembly prove to be muted or non-existent, there is a distinct danger that the IRA may consider starting up a new phase of increased violence as its only recourse. c. 
Protestant Community. Protestant opinion is divided on the proposals 
of the White Paper as they now stand, but much will depend on the way the political situation develops in the month ahead. A substantial proportion of the community seems to be in favour of giving the White raper a chance to work. Of the proportion which opposes it, there is an element which is prepared to use violence, whose members have equipped themselves with weapons and have demonstrated a capability in the recent past for terrorism and for inciting violence as a means of exerting pressure. It is this element which can be expected, in response to IRA terrorism or any fears of a "sell out" to present a threat to law and order in the foreseeable future. d. 
Scenario. Although a return to some sort of normality is assumed, it 
is clear that there will continue to be a threat to law and order for some years to come. The level of lawlessness is likely to show periodic peaks of intensity. It is possible that a period of similar intensity to the

current emergency could occur again within the foreseeable future. The threat to law and order may be presented by the followings 
(1) Periodic civil disobedience campaigns. (2) Periodic politically-motivated industrial action. (3) Marches, rallies and passive demonstrations. (4) Isolated acts of intimidation and minor lawlessness. (5) Occasional acts of violence, particularly at sectarian interfaces. 
(6) Occasional escalation to riot situations, arising from any of the above. (7) Occasional isolated outbreaks of terrorism and bombing. 
6. The RUC. Although it is assumed that the RUC will be reorganised and 
strengthened in such a way as to enable it to assume responsibility for policing in all areas of Northern Ireland, it is desirable that it should revert basically to the Hunt Commission’s concept of an unarmed force along traditional GB lines. There are two particular aspects, however, which have a bearing on the future structure of the Army. a. 
Police Reserves. In the past, before implementation of the 
Hunt Commission recommendations, the RUC was able to rely on the support of the Ulster Special Constabulary. This was a force of some 15,000 armed, para-military reservists whose role has been partially adopted by the UDR. The RUC Reserve in contrast is, and almost certainly gill in the future be smaller, and is designed simply to supplement the regular force as necessary in normal police duties. b. 
Riot Control. Although the RUC is likely to follow the current 
trend in GB towards further development of Special Patrol Groups, it is by no means certain that the RUC should form its own riot squads. The current campaign has demonstrated the problems which flow from the rejection of the police force by a substantial proportion of the community; this has forced the Army, whose impartiality has remained credible, to adopt the police responsibility for riot control. It is essential that, once its acceptability throughout the Province is re-established, the RUC should not be required to take action which could jeopardise its impartial image; riot control, by its very nature, is bound to involve the use of force against a particular section of the community and thus could be too easily represented as a "partial"

act, if carried out by the RUC. Being essentially CB-based, in contract, the Army is less likely to be successfully accused of sectarian bias. 
7. Intelligence. So long as the Army remains committed in the future to assist 
with the maintenance of Internal security in the Province, a military intelligence organization must be retained. 8. Deductions a. From the assessment of the threat and limitations in size and strength of the RUC, it is clear that the Army in Northern Ireland will have to retain certain internal security responsibilities for the foreseeable future. These responsibilities are likely to include: (1) Anti-riot duties in support of the RUC. (2) Anti-terrorist operations as and when required. (3) Assisting the RUC in the control of large scale marches and rallies, particularly near interfaces. (4) Border surveillance (Regular Army by day; with the UDR by night). (5) Assisting the RUC and Civil Authority in the event of emergencies or natural disasters. (6) Home Defence tasks during a period of tension or general war. (7) Maintaining its war emergency capability. (8) Intelligence collection, collation and liaison. 
b. The seeds of dissension and hate are so endemic in Northern Irish society that, even if reasonably peaceful conditions are achieved in the foreseeable future, there remains a strong probability of another terrorist campaign breaking out again. It is therefore important that the Army’s peacetime structure should: (1) Be appropriately sited to maintain close links with the RUC and detailed knowledge of the local community, and to deal with areas of conflict as far as possible from its peacetime locations. (2) Be of sufficient size to constitute a deterrent to terrorists and, if deterrence fails, to deal effectively and quickly with possibly widespread outbreaks of violence once the RUC requests Army assistance. .If the Army’s peacetime strength in the Province is too small, it would lack credibility and

It can quickly reinforce the Regular ArMy at critical periods by call-out, albeit only for a limited time. 
c. 
17. In an improved security situation there will, not be the need, nor can the community be expected to support recruitment for eleven battalions. The actual strength of the UDR will be determined more by recruiting than operational factors, but it is considered that the Regiment should reduce to between four and seven battalions. Their actual deployment and areas of responsibility will be determined by a number of factors, including the following: a. b. c. d. e. 
The areas of high recruitment. The location of permanent accommodation. 
The importance to morale of local affiliations. Any reorganisation of RUC boundaries. Likely areas of operational deployment. 
18. If the UDR reduced in size, there would be merit in establishing a list 
of ex-members of the Regiment who might be called upon to rejoin should the internal security situation deteriorate again. 19. It is considered that HQ UDR, possibly with some additional responsibilities, ? will be required to command the Regiment, though brigades would continue to exercise operational control. Some reduction in the size of the HQ is foreseen. REGULAR ARMY 20. Units a. 
RAC/Infantry. For purposes of continuity, liaison with the RUC, 
and familiarisation, units should be allocated specific areas of internal security responsibility as set out below. However, in the event of serious trouble requiring military intervention, units could and would be deployed as required throughout the Province. (1) Belfast. The city is the traditional seat of security problems where experience has shown that intimidation, intersectarian conflict and terrorist violence can develop rapidly. The effect of the situation in Belfast on the rest of the Province is significant, not least because it contains about one third of the total population and includes areas of historic support for the IRA and Protestant extremists. It is the seat of political and economic power and the majority of sensitive installations are located within its boundaries.

South, and for the intelligence cell with the rural police HQ. f. 
Additional married quarters. TRANSITION TO THE PEACETIME FORCE LEVEL 
23. Transition from the present force level and deployment will clearly be determined by four key factors: 
a. Continued improvement in the security situation as a result 
of political progress, attrition of terrorist organisations, reduction of intimidation and war-weariness of an increasing proportion of the community. b. 
The success of interim policing measures using RMP, and the 
speed with which the RUC is re-organised and strengthened, and gains the acceptance of the majority of the community.

PEACETIME STRUCTURE OF THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND I have the following minor amendments to the HQNI paper:- 
The Threat 1. Delete last sentence of para 5a(2) and substitute:- 
"At the least therefore, material, training and propaganda support is likely to be available for the IRA from outside sources, to help them sustain violence as a political weapon". 
Comment - Because of the remarkably insular character of the IRA, it is doubtful if they will be significantly susceptible to direct influence by other terrorist organizations. 
2. Delete the first sentence of para 5c and rewrite para as follows: 
"Protestant Community. Protestant opinion is divided on the proposals of the White Paper as they now stand. Much will depend on the way the political situation develops in the months ahead. Although a majority of Protestant opinion seems in favour of giving the White Paper a chance to work there is a considerable minority who are not. Within the minority is an element which is prepared to use violence, whose members have equipped themselves with weapons and have demonstrated a capability in the recent past for terrorism and for inciting violence as a means of exerting pressure. It is this element which can be expected, in response to IRA terrorism or any threat of a ’sell out’, to present a threat to law and order in the foreseeable future" 
3. I strongly endorse para7. I suggest that the following should be added to pars 21d.(4):- 
’This should be within a framework of a computerised system run by the RUC, which would facilitate a rapid build-up of the military intelligence effort if the need were to arise’.

infantry in support of the RUC, especially in the cities. I quite see that the study would be on no firmer ground in assuming that there would be police riot squads than there wouldn’t: and it would be tiresome to have to postulate alternative troop requirements according to which assumption one made. Perhaps the best that the paper can do is to say that it is not possible to assume definitely that the RUC either will or will not be permitted (etc); to express a tentative view about which is the likelier; but to add that for the purposes of this study it is thought safer to assume that they will not. 
4. 5. I entirely agree with what the paper has to say (in paragraphs 
20b(iii) and 25) about the requirement for the RMP in a civil policing role being likely to last somewhat beyond the stage when the peacetime force level is reached. 
I have referred to the discussion of training facilities. 
From reading paragraph 9 I am not at all clear whether it purports to deal only with the requirements for training for the IS tasks for which the units would primarily be garrisoned in Northern Ireland, or only with training for their BAOR/UKMF tasks, or - as I would guess - a mixture of the two. I suggest that this should be made clearer. 
6. 
I have a few minor drafting comments: a. 
Paragraphs 1 and 5c will of course need to be up- 
dated to take account of the outcome of the Assembly Election (and of any other developments which follow until the paper goes to press). 
b. Paragraph 2: I would be inclined to put factor 
c first. c. 
Paragraph 5a(ii): Is the Irish problem being 
exacerbated already to any significant extent by international terrorist movements? If not it cannot "continue to be". 
d. Paragraph 6: The RUC was not really a basically 
unarmed force in the past, except perhaps during the first few months after the adoption of the Hunt Report; so the words "revert to" ought perhaps to be replaced by "develop into". 
7. Finally, so far as I am competent to do so, I agree with 
Head of DS7’s comments in his minute to you of 28 June about what the paper has to say on the future of the UDR.

PEACETIME STRUCTURE OF THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND INTRODUCTION 
BACKGROUND 1. 
The publication of HMG’s White Paper on the constitutional future 
of Northern Ireland did not provoke a significantly violent reaction, although the Provisional IRA and certain Protestant extremists have declared their opposition to its provisions. The Official IRA appear to be maintaining their concentration on political activity. There are encouraging signs that the majority of the community are tired of violence and keen to pursue their political aspirations by democratic processes. The elections are having the desired effect of concentrating attention on political action. 
2. It must now be hoped that there will be a gradual return to more 
peaceful conditions in Northern Ireland. The degree of normality which eventually exists will depend on many factors which it is not at this stage possible to predict accurately. These include: a. 
The policy and capability of extremist organizations. b. The ability of the RUC to assume full responsibility for 
law enforcement throughout the Province. c. 
Assembly and Executive. 
AIM 3. 
The successful establishment of a workable Northern Ireland The aim of this paper is to recommend a peacetime structure for the Army in Northern Ireland

ASSUMPTIONS 4. 
It is assumed that: a. 
The developing trend towards peace in which an increasing 
majority of the community rejects terrorism, will gain momentum. Such lawlessness as is sustained will become progressively within the capacity of the RUC to control. 
b. Following its hoped-for reorganisation and increase in 
strength, the RUC will gradually become more acceptable in all areas in Northern Ireland. This process will be helped and hastened by the interim deployment of RMP, primarily in RC areas where the RUC are currently unacceptable. 
c. Steps must be taken as soon as possible to move towards the 
agreed peacetime Army structure in order to reduce turbulence and strain on the Regular Army. Providing the security situation continues to improve a reduction in force levels could begin towards the end of 1973. 
d. Elements of the Northern Ireland peacetime garrison will 
continue to be earmarked to reinforced BAOR and the UKMF. e. 
While it is impossible to be precise about time scale, the 
various stages of progress towards the peacetime structure might occur as follows: 
(1) Mid-1973 until at least 1976 - RMP interim policing, 
and build up of the RUC. (2) 
Late 1973 until late 1975 - reduction of Regular 
Army and UDR force levels and the gradual implementation of the peacetime structure.

violence as a means of demonstrating its conviction. This element could numerically be strengthened if former detainees were released under the Emergency Provisions Bill review procedure. There is little prospect of change in the IRA’s long term aim to reunify Ireland by any means including force, except when a ceasefire appears at the time to be more expedient. Should the Republicans’ voice in the new Assembly prove to be muted or non-existent, there is a distinct danger that the IRA may consider a new phase of increased violence is its only recourse. 
c. Protestant Community. Even though a proportion of the 
community rejects the White Paper’s proposals, it is clear that the prevailing attitude, subject to any major demonstration to the contrary at the forthcoming elections, is that the proposals should be given a chance to work. However, there is a significant element which is prepared to use violence, has equipped itself with weapons, and has demonstrated its capability in the recent past. 
It is this element which, 
particularly in response to IRA terrorism, can be expected to remain troublesome and to present a threat to law and order for the foreseeable future. 
d. Scenario. Although a return to some sort of normality is 
assumed, it is clear that there will continue to be a threat to law and order for some years to come. The level of lawlessness is likely to show periodic peaks of intensity. It is possible that a period of similar intensity to the current emergency could occur again within the foreseeable future. The threat to law and order may be presented by the following: 
(1) Periodic civil disobedience campaigns.

(2) (3) (4) (5) Periodic politically-motivated industrial action. Marches, rallies and passive demonstrations. Isolated acts of intimidation and minor lawlessness. Occasional acts of violence, particularly at 
sectarian interfaces. (6) 
Occasional escalation to riot situations, arising 
from any of the above. (7) 
bombing. 6. The RUC. Although it is assumed that the RUC will be reorganised 
and strengthened in such a way as to enable it to assume responsibility for policing all areas of Northern Ireland, it is desirable that it should revert basically to an unarmed force along traditional GB lines. In the past, before implementation of the Hunt Commission recommendations the RUC was able to rely on the support of the Ulster Special Constabulary, a large body of armed, para-military reservists; the RUC Reserve, in contrast is, and almost certainly will in the future be smaller, and is designed simply to supplement the regular force as necessary. It is assumed that the RUC will not be permitted to equip and train special anti-riot squads. 
7. Intelligence. So long as the Army remains committed in the future 
to assist with the maintenance of internal security in the Province, a military intelligence organisation must be retained. 
8.

Ireland will have to retain certain internal security responsibilities for the foreseeable future. These responsibilities are likely to include: 
(1) (2) (3) Anti-riot duties in support of the RUC. Anti-terrorist operations. Assisting the RUC in the control of large scale 
marches and rallies, particularly near interfaces. (4) 
Border surveillance. (5) Assisting the RUC and Civil Authority in the event 
of emergencies or natural disasters. (6) 
general war. (7) 
(8) b. Home Defence tasks during a period of tension or Maintaining its war emergency capability. Intelligence collection, collation and liaison. The seeds of dissension and hate are so endemic in Northern 
Irish society that, even if reasonably peaceful conditions are achieved in the foreseeable future, there remains a strong probability of another terrorist campaign breaking out again. It is therefore important that the Army’s peacetime structure should: 
(1) (2) Be sited to maintain close links with the RUC. Be sufficiently large and well trained to deter would- 
be terrorists and (3) 
Have an intelligence organisation which: (a) 
Can form a cadre for immediate expansion,

b. The need for economy which Implies that maximum use must 
be made of existing permanent accommodation; this may not be located in the best position from an operational point of view. 
The need to preserve some spare accommodation capacity to provide for expansion in the event of a future terrorist campaign. 
c. 
TAVR 15. 
The TAVR has not been actively involved in the current emergency 
and no major change in the future is considered likely. TAVR units in Northern Ireland are listed at Annex B, together with their general war roles. 
UDR 16. 
It is clear that the UDR, which was formed during the current 
emergency and has proved its value since, will continue to be required. It has three fundamental assets: 
a. Being a locally-raised, part-time force, it provides a 
means whereby members of the community can play an active part in the maintenance of law and order, and it possesses invaluable local knowledge. 
b. Although by its nature unable to replace regular troops 
in all internal security roles, it is well suited to relieving them of the more passive tasks. This has the merit of reducing the overall requirement for Regular Army units in internal security operations. 
It can quickly reinforce the Regular Army at critical periods by call-out, albeit only for a limited time.

throughout the Province. (1) 
Belfast. The city is the traditional seat of security 
problems, contains about one third of the total population of the Province, includes areas of historic support for the IRA and Protestant extremists, and has a number of sectarian interfaces. Its size and complexity requires that three battalions should be operationally earmarked for Belfast and its environs. 
(2) Londonderry. Because the city is an emotive centre 
for both Protestants and RCs, a source of traditional support for the IRA, and is close to the Eire border it should be the responsibility of at least one infantry battalion. 
(3) Border and Rural Areas. The most sensitive areas are 
the border itself, the mid-Ulster towns and the Craigavon development area which, on current plans, will become the largest centre of population after Belfast. Two infantry battalions should be operationally earmarked for this area, supported by the armoured reconnaissance regiment. 
(4) Province Reserve. Because internal security incidents 
tend to develop rapidly and because of the possible need to provide ’cover’ while battalions are out of the Province on leave or training, a Province reserve is desirable. However, in the situation envisaged, it is considered that this task could be undertaken when necessary by one of the two border/rural infantry battalions. 
(5) Summary. It is estimated that the peacetime 
garrison should include one armoured reconnaissance regiment and six infantry battalions

23. Transition from the present force level and deployment will 
clearly be determined by four key factors: a. 
Continued improvement in the security situation as a result 
of political progress, war-weariness of an increasing proportion of the community, attrition of terrorist organisations and reduction of intimidation. 
b. The success of interim policing measures using RMP, and the 
speed with which the RUC is re-organised and strengthened, and gains the acceptance of the majority of the community. 
c. Pressures on the Regular Army generally to reduce 
turbulence. d. 
The speed with which accommodation becomes available for th permanent garrison. CONCLUSIONS 24. The Army’s peacetime force level in Northern Ireland should be 
reduced to HQNI to brigade HQs, SMIU(NI) (including the cell with the rural police HQ), one armoured reconnaissance regiment, one field squadron

GENERAL 1. 
a. The climate for the Northern Ireland Assembly Elections(MTAB) 
is likely to be similar to that of the Local Government Elections Which took place on 30 May 1973. However, because of the greater significance of the NIAE, the level of tension will inevitably be higher, with a correspondingly greater risk of any particular incident or terrorist act 
leading to an increased use of violence. b. 
No significant direct threat to the NIAE is foreseen, though 
attempts at intimidation can be expected. Whilst elements of the official IRA (OIRA) will be involved in campaigning for Republican Club candidates, the Provisional IRA (PIRA) is likely to try to attack soft and possibly eye catching targets at election time. Extreme Protestant groups may be expected to continue to perpetrate isolated outrages. 
c. In spite of the threat posed by extremist groups the outlook for 
the poll itself is bright. With virtually all political organisations now encouraging their supporters to use their voting papers rather than abstain, a high poll can be expected, possibly in the region of 80% of the electorate, inclusive of postal votes. 
OFFICIAL IRA/SINN FEIN 2. 
There are 10 Republican Club (and one Republican Labour) candidates for the 
NIAE and the more politically-minded of the OIRA will certainly be heavily involved campaigning on their behalf. Disillusionment with the Republican Club candidates in the LGE may lead some of the wilder elements among the OIRA, who are already discontented at their relative lack of action, into acts of local violence. One report has suggested that there might be some deliberate OIRA terrorist acts before the NIAE, but it is thought unlikely that there will be any fundamental change in OIRA tactics. Barring any general upsurge in violence, the OIRA leadership will probably stick to its "retaliation only" policy. 
PROVISIONAL IRA/SINN FEIN 3. 
The PIRA have only a negative interest in the NIAE. The comparative failure 
of the policy of intimidation, and the exposure of attempts by OIRA/Sinn Fein voters to gain votes by personating abstaining Provisional voters at the LGE, has led the Provisionals to advise their supporters to spoil their ballot papers rather than not participate. Given the present dominance of the PIR by Twomey and other Northern hard-liners, the present policy of violence seems bound to continue. Reports indicate that there may be attempts to escalate activity during the pre-election period. There is nothing to indicate that the PIRA will try to attack targets specifically connected with the elections. However, it would be consistent for them to attempt to draw attention away from politics by violent means, and possibly to attempt some form of spectacular attack to obtain maximum publicity. It is also possible, especially in Londonderry, that any planned series of anti-internment marches and demonstrations may be used to provoke incidents with SF.

unable to carry out, or unable to carry out unaided, their duties at the polling station. 
The maintenance of order in a polling station is primarily the 
responsibility of the presiding officer, supported by the RUC. 4. 
they may: a. 
Where soldiers enter a polling station in support of the RUC, Arrest a person committing a breach of the peace or another 
serious offence to which soldiers’ normal powers of arresting persons red-handed apply. Where possible however such arrests should be made by the RUC. 
b. Remove from the polling station a person other than an 
offender under 4a above, who misconducts himself or who fails to obey the lawful order of the presiding officer, but only if the presiding officer orders it. 
5. 6. On no account are soldiers to take photographs in polling stations. If, in exceptional circumstances, soldiers make arrests as in 
paragraph 4a. the arrested person is to be handed over to the police as soon as possible via an RMP arrest team. 
Arrest Policy 7. 
Reference D applies, except that planned arrest operations are to be 
conducted only as specific and local responses in the event of terrorist outrages. Otherwise persons falling into the categories specified in paragraph 7 of reference D are to be arrested only if they are seen at large. If such persons are seen in the vicinity of polling stations they are, if circumstances permit, to be arrested after leaving the polling station rather than before casting their vote.

Political Issues: Inter-Party Talks The immediate question concerns the nature of the replies to the 
letters which the Home Secretary has received from Mr. Callaghan and Sir Harry Nicholas about the scope of the proposed talks. Mr. Callaghan’s letter simply asks for confirmation that they would be "open-ended", while ir harry Nicholas says more explicitly that internment is an impediment to 
the success of any political initiative. The Government’s reply should presumably confirm that any talks would be "open-ended" in the sense of being without prejudice and without commitment on the part of any of the participants. But should it not add that this means, so far as the Government are concerned, that there can be no question of ending internment unilaterally, i.e. so long as violence persists ? 2. 
If so, however, the prospects for the talks are not bright. 
Dr. Paisley has indicated that he will not take part if unification is on the agenda; and, despite some recent haverings by Mr. Fitt, it seems fairly clear that the SDLP will not participate if the Government say that they are not prepared to end internment. 
This is not necessarily 
an unsatisfactory position for the Government, at least in the short term, since public opinion is not likely to agree that the Government should let loose a lot of gunmen and terrorists in return for no more than a promise merely to take part in inter-Party talks without any assurance that they will have a successful outcome. And, provided that internment itself is properly managed (and this is for discussion under a later item on the agenda) and that the Army seem to be continuing to gain the upper hand over the IRA, the Government can probably afford to rest in this position at least for the time being. 3. 
But it is not a long-term policy; and sooner or later the Government 
will he driven to try to devise some new political initiative which offers better prospects of success than inter-Party talks as at present envisaged. Here we confront the old dilemma 
- should any new initiative be based on the 
fundamental premises that the Border remains intact and that the Stormont system continues; or should it envisage some basic modification in these assumptions? Hitherto, Ministers have judged that it would not be possible to modify ither of them without risking the fall of Mr. Faulkner’s Government and the inevitable need, as a result, to introduce direct rule.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 43 29 DECEMBER 1971 
Incidents during the period 23 - 28 December The period of the Christmas holiday passed quite quietly, with 
comparatively few minor incidents and no really major ones. (A dayby-day summary of the incidents which did occur is attached at Annex.) Throughout the period there were 16 explosions 
- as well as a number 
of bomb hoaxes - and 44 outbreaks of shooting. There were gunshot wounds, fortunately all slight, to a soldier of 1 Glosters in Belfast on 27 December and to two RUC constables in Strabane on 28 December; and one terrorist is believed to have been hit. One soldier and one civilian were fatally injured in accidents involving Service vehicles. Altogether 61 wanted persons were arrested during the period, none of them of outstanding importance but including two IRA quartermasters. 2. 
Yesterday was the least peaceful day in the period, with some 
minor rioting of the usual kind in Londonderrry in reaction to a successful search operation in the Boside. 3. 
A bomb which had failed to explode has been found on the 
premises of the Grand Orange Lodge in Glasgow. Staff for internment and detention 
4. It is hoped that the first results of the Home Office’s trawl 
for volunteers from the British Prisons Service to serve in Northern Ireland will be known within two or three days. There is not then expected to be much delay in sending over the volunteers as they become available. The need thus to reinforce the warder staff in Northern Ireland, and to stiffen it with some extra experience, remains very urgent if the capacity for accommodating internees and detainees is not to fall too far behind the rate of arrests and internments implicit in the present concept of operations. So far it has not been necessary to halt arrests, but they are having to be

Incidents in th last 72 hours -It was a comparativey quiet weekend; but there were four 
civilian deaths on Saturday, resulting from explosions. At Magherafelt three youngmen were killed when the car in which they were travelling was blown to pieces, apparently by a bomb which they were carrying. A pistol was found under one of the bodies. In the Clonard area of Belfast 
- a mixed area - an explosion at Murtagh’s 
Bar killed a boy of sixteen who was employed there and caused minor injuries to three other people. 2. 
Earlier on Friday, bombs caused extensive damage in a printing 
works in Belfast and also damaged the RUC station at Castledawson and a small transformer at Portglenoe. 
On Sunday evening an 
explosion in a shirt factory in Belfast injured one civilian and started a fire which gutted the building. 3. 
There were also several shooting incidents. On Friday there 
were three in Belfast - in one of which a soldier was shot in the shoulder 
- and four in Londonderry. On Saturday there were another 
seven in Londonderry - in one of which, terrorist snipers who were aiming at a military patrol hit and seriously injured a woman bystander; there there two more in Belfast 
- in one of which a soldier 
was shot in the arm; and at Pomeroy the RUC station was fired on from three passing cars, with no casualties and with no apparent hits when the fire was returned. 4.

game, with a toy gun - it was a tremendously foolish thing to be going at 11 p.m. on a winter’s night in the present circumstances of 
Northern Ireland. 6. 
It seems clear that Mr. Austin Currie and his SDLP colleagues 
will seek to make a major issue of this incident. Official line on how terrorism will end 7 . 
The PR authorities are continually being asked how the Government 
envisages that terrorism in Northern Ireland will be brought to an end. It is thought. that the right line to take in reply is that it will come to a halt when the terrorists call off their attacks 
- to which 
end the Government is bringing to bear every possible pressure, military and political, to make it clear both to the IRA and to those who support them that terrorism is not paying. Proposed BBC television debate 8. 
It appears that the BBC are intent on going ahead with their 
scheme to stage a lengthy debate about Northern Ireland on television, but have postponed it beyond the date originally chosen - 5 January while they think further about the details of the programme’s form. They certainly need to do so, since in such preliminary discussions as have taken place they have shown remarkably little grasp of the facts about such aspects as which Irish politicans represent which party. BBC programmes about the IRA 9. 
The BBC have also revealed plans for two television programmes 
concerning the IRA: one showing a day in the life of the IRA organisation in Dublin, the other comprising an interview - by Bernard Falk 
- with Rory Brady. On the first, our Ambassador in 
Dublin has pointed out that Mr. Lynch does not allow Irish television to show programmes featuring the IRA. However, this is not necessarily a reason for discouraging the BBC from making such a programme; on the contrary, it is thought that the balance of advantage lies in allowing a programme to be made which, when shown, would furnish

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 34 13 DECEMBER 1971 
Incidents in the last 72 hours Altogether there were very much fewer separate incidents than 
during the other 2 weekends, but the period was marred by 3 particularly cold-blooded IRA attacks. 2. 
In Belfast, 2 male civilians and 2 babies were killed when an 
explosion completely demolished a furnishing shop in the Shankill area, shortly. after mid-day on Saturday. Significantly, although this is normally regarded as a militant Protestant area, no antiCatholic disturbances ensued. 3. 
Early on Sunday evening, senator Barnhill - a prominent Unionist politican - was attacked in his home near the border, just north of 
Strabane. The gunmen shot him 2 or 3 times, then dragged his body into the dining-room and placed it beside a bomb 
- having ordered Mrs. 
Barnhill out of the house. The bomb then exploded and demolished half the house. This attack is consistent with the expectation that the IRA would go increasingly for easy targets which would also have publicity value. 4. 
Details are now available of the murder of Sergeant Smyth on Friday morning - the third murder of an off-duty member of the UDR on 
successive days. Smyth, who was a Protestant, was travelling in his private land rover with a companion, McCormack (a Roman Catholic who had been in the UDR but had resigned). They stopped at a farmhouse gate to pick up another man, Leith (a Protestant with no UDR connections), when 2 shots were fired from bushes nearby, killing McCormack. The gunman then came forward and fired point-blank at Smyth, who had dived for cover, killing him; and then, completely ignoring Leith, walked away to join a companion heading for the border 200 metres away. Leith then raised the alarm.

Northern Ireland The agenda on Monday morning can perhaps be conveniently 
divided under the following three headings:A. 
Situation reports, as necessary. We shall need to have the Army’s 
assessment of the renewed outburst of violence in the last few days in the light of the intelligence reports that the IRA (particularly the Brady faction) are becoming increasingly disorganised and disheartened. 
Is the murder 
of the 2 UDR men a precursor of a campaign directed against the UDR or Roman Catholic members of it? If so, are measures being taken? What is the situation over Protestant extremists? Who blew up McGurk’s bar? The latest intelligence reports suggest that the explosion was caused accidently amongst a group which contained an identified Brady IRA victim Have further investigations shed more light? 2. 
It might be as well to check, in addition, that the police in this 
country are ready to deal with any IRA attacks on public utilities over Christmas, about which there have been several rumours. 3. 
In addition the following specific questions need attention:(i) 
Internment procedures. The Home Secretary raised with 
Mr. Faulkner at their recent meeting the possibility of improving these procedures, e. g. by giving an internee a written statement of the allegation against him; by considering appeals in two stages, with legal representation at one but not at the other; and by enlarging the Appeals Committee in order to accelerate the hearings. Mr. Faulkner undertook to submit proposals on all these points; but we should keep up the pressure to ensure that he does so. 
(ii) 
Internment accommodation. Arrests continue at a pretty high level; and the pressure on accommodation is again becoming acute. Against the background of the ICRC report, we cannot afford a scandal on this point; and, since there seems to be some difference of view between the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence about the action to be taken (see the minute of 9th December from the Secretary of State for Defence to the Home Secretary), it would be useful to clarify this point and to define the responsibility for dealing with it.

11. Meanwhile, it is perhaps not irrelevant that the mysterious 
scufflings which we have detected behind the arras in recent weeks appear to be continuing 
- see the attached JIC report (JIC(A)(71)(SA) 210), 
particularly the reference in the first paragraph to the contacts between Mr. Boal, Mr. Paisley and the Brady IRA. Far-fetched though it may sound, I think that we should be on our guard against being outflanked by some separate deal, however short-lived, between the extreme Protestants and the extreme Republicans.

Sir Burke St. John Trend, GCB, CVO would be for it." Colley’s new attitude might also be significant. 
24th November, 1971 But 
any move could come only as part of a deal: no Irish Government in the present climate of opinion would dare to move significantly against the I.R.A. without something which would really enable them to sway the Irish public in favour of a peaceful solution, and into acceptance of the measures needed to secure peace. 
6. That was the main point, and indeed O’Sullivan came back several 
times to the possibility of internment in the South. 7. 
Another noteworthy point was that O’Sullivan repeatedly pressed me I professed total ignorance (and very genuinely) but 
on whether some new political initiative by the British Government might be expected soon. 
said that if I myself were thinking of one, I would propose it for Christmas; he appeared to take this seriously. 
8. fears over the position of Lynch. 
The Ambassadors anxiety for an early British initiative arises from He contested with earnest emotion my 
suggestion that whoever succeeded Lynch would unavoidably and very speedily learn to follow (no worse than) a Lynch policy. 
The probable successor 
at present, he said, was Hillery, possibly a Hillery/Haughey partnership, which would be a reckless combination and cause us infinite trouble. 
election with a victory for the Opposition would be a disaster: even if they were to be regarded as worthy, they were incompetent and could not possibly cope with the I.R.A. the way Lynch could. 
translate this by saying that Fianna Fail are closer to the I.R.A. than Fine Gael and the Irish Labour Party; which is true). 
9. The word ’internment’ was not once mentioned but we got on to the subject of direct rule. 
was essential to maintain Stormont. 
O’Sullivan was most apprehensive over this: it When I probed this we decided that 
what he meant was not the constitution, but the constitutional status. He did not even want to see Stormont suspended, since he (very rightly) believes that any suspension would inevitably be permanent, because no one could ever contemplate restoring that very odd edifice. be a victory for the I.R.A. and a step towards civil war. 
10. A re-drawing of the border and an exchange of populations might once have been possible but in present circumstances would be an invitation to riot and bloodshed. 
11. I made relatively little contribution to the conversation except at the end when I picked up a reference of the Ambassador’s to the increasingly anti-British state of feeling in Dublin.

by Irish public opinion would lead to the result that many people in Dublin now appeared to regard as possible or available - that the British would not merely withdraw the troops from Northern Ireland but would disarm every single Protestant before doing so. 
That possibility was not available, so that 
any serious present-day attempt to secure the unification of Ireland could only lead to the spread of terror and destruction to the South, in fact to civil war. 
The Ambassador did not dissent, but my view is that the genuine

g r ounds i f , as one may hope, the impr oved situation both 
reduced the risk involved in setting free some of the internees, and increased the Availability of evidence on which others among them could be convicted. At the first signs of a real improvement the word could be allowed to get around that, while internment as such was certainly not being dispensed with immediately, the way in which it was applied was under reconsideration, 
7. As regards those already in internment, the obvious way to 
indicate a fresh approach would be to step up, the release of those who, in the improved situation, were regarded as only marginally a threat to security. This, would not necessarily mean overriding the existing review procedure (unless and until it was judged expedient for symbolic reasons to dispense with Judge Brown and his colleagues) but the review committee would need to be given fresh policy directions and perhaps additional personnel so as to speed up their work. As for the hard core of internees who could not safely be released, the hope would of course be to acquire sufficient evidence, in the improved situation, to be able to prosecute most of them. a. 
As regards wanted men who are still at large, the Government 
would certainly not wish to dispense altogether with the option of arresting ringleaders but it could be hinted fairly clearly that, since witnesses were showing greater willingness to come forward, the emphasis would thenceforth be on prosecution rather than internment and that the latter would in invoked, if at all, only for the most dangerous terrorists who were arrested in future. (The public line on this could be very similar to that

used by the Secretary of State on the future of Interrogation; that the Government could not be expected to tie its hands, but would obviously be having full regard to 
- in this case - the improved security situation - and that the Press and public 
must read between the lines of those remarks.) It would have to be made clear in any pronouncements, official or unofficial, on internment that the subject was primarily the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Government. Possible arms amnesty 9. 
In a period of much-reduced terrorism - whether or not there had been suggestions for a cease-fire - it would be worth 
considering whether to offer an amnesty for illegally held weapons. If this were done, it should also be made the occasion for trying to haul in some of the very many weapons held legally (mainly, of course, by the Protestants). This would need the sanction of a clear threat that in future the licencing of firearms would be much more stringent. If that could be agreed with the Northern Ireland Government, the initiative on this subject could then take the form of an announcement that licencing was in future going to be conducted more restrictively; that anyone who felt he could dispense with his firearms was therefore urged to hand them in; and that anyone handing in an unlicensed firearm - within a very limited period 
- would be immune from 
prosecution for having possessed it illegally. 10. Any such move would have to be carefully timed so that it was not obviously a response to some suggestion for a truce.

Suggestions for a Christmas truce 11. Proposals for a truce between the security forces and the IRA over the Christmas period should be treated just as any other truce proposals: ie by making it clear that there is no scope for a truce with criminals, that if the terrorists want a cease-fire it is up to them to stop shooting and bombing, and that the law must be upheld during Christmas in the same way as at any other time. Consultation with the Northern Ireland Government 12. If Ministers in London agree that it would be right, in a period of much-reduced terrorist activity, to ease up on security measures generally and internment in particular, they will wish to consider how they could best carry the Northern Ireland Government with them in thus varyingthe tactics 
- since the 
co-operation of the Northern Ireland authorities would be essential if the new approach were to achieve its object of generating further de-escalation, especially where internment is concerned. Any signs that terrorism was falling away significantly would therefore need to be made the occasion for immediate discussions with the Northern Ireland Government about tactics (which might well form part of wider discussions with them about the political future); and there would be a good case, at that point, for inviting Mr. Faulkner over for fresh talks.

NORTHERN IRELAND - INTERNMENT ACCOMMODATION As you know, there are immediate problems in providing 
sufficient accommodation for internees and detainees in Northern Ireland to keep pace with the number of terrorists on whom detention and internment orders are being served. 
2. The Northern Ireland Government have asked that, to deal 
with the bulk of the prospective excess, use should again be made of the accommodation ship MAIDSTONE 
- this time to house up to 150 internees. From the Army’s point of view, this is an 
extremely inconvenient request, since we had hoped to use MAIDSTONE (together with another accommodation ship HARTLAND POINT, which is being moved to Belfast later this month) for much-needed accommodation for soldiers during the winter months. Nevertheless, on the facts as presented to me, I can see no alternative: I have therefore reluctantly agreed that MAIDSTONE should be made available for this purpose. At the same time, I must place on record some dissatisfaction that the matter has been presented for Ministerial decision in this form and at such short notice, when Sir James Dunnett has for some time been drawing attention at his daily meetings to the evident need for the Prison Authorities to take steps to meet the crisis that was only too evidently developing and when I understand that the GOC has similarly been warning the Northern Ireland Government of the difficulties ahead. 
3. If MAIDSTONE is to be used it will of course be essential 
that there should be adequate arrangements for guarding the inmates. I learn from the GOC that the Northern Ireland Prison Service are hardpressed to find sufficient custodial staff for the task of guarding internees, and this problem will be aggravated by the re-opening of MAIDSTONE. No doubt you are considering this aspect of the matter. It may be something which should be raised at our GEN 47 meeting on Monday morning. 
I am copying this minute to the Prime Minister, to our other colleagues on GEN 47 and to Sir Burke Trend.

We took note then my Lords of the effect which internment had already begun to have, in denying to dangerous men the freedom of movement which they had previously enjoyed, and in greatly increasing the flow of intelligence about further terrorists and their activities. 
And we recognised then that, despite these improvements, it would be most unsafe to attempt to forecast how long it would take before terrorism could be brought to a halt. 
My Lords, moving on from that time to the present, I think it might be helpful if I were first to describe the current security situation - 
since, however much we may 
recognise that there can be no purely military solution, it remains vital to realise that the pace of progress in the political (and for that matter the economic) fields is very largely dictated by the state of security,

The essence of the present security position is that the IRA’s strength is being steadily undermined. 
The build-up of intelligence about the identity, organisation, whereabouts and methods of the terrorists is continuing all the time; and, more often than not, each new bit of information leads to several more - so that there is a snowball effect, enabling the security forces to have a steadily clearer picture of how and where to track down the terrorists. 
This is matched by a steady increase in the expertise of the Army and Police in knowing how to set about this difficult and dangerous task. 
It is worth remarking that, while there are many disadvantages in having some battalions returning to Northern Ireland for second, third and fourth tours there, this does means that many of the newly arrived units already have a great deal of valuable experience of operations in Northern Ireland.

of course, my success. 
Lords it is not a picture of unmitigated A few areas in Belfast are still 
very troublesome, Explosions continue to take place, as do assassinations. 
There are periodical setbacks when terrorists who have already been arrested manage to escape. More serious, there are still frequent raids by well-organised groups from the other side of the Border; though recent actions on the part of the authorities in the Republic, such as the arrests of seven men in Dundalk last Friday, give some hope that these raids may gradually grow fewer. 
Nor as we saw at the weekend is the situation in Londonderry improving comparatively to Belfast. 
Nevertheless in the last few months real progress has been made by the security forces in this most difficult of situations. And I commend them for their efficiency and restraint.

Mobile patrols are continuing to pay frequent visits to all points along the border; while at the same time we have blocked a large number of unauthorised crossing points. I cannot pretend that this latter action has made it quite impossible to make an unauthorised crossing of the border, but it does help us to limit the number of points at which such crossings can be made 
- and 
supports the more precise operations which are mounted on the basis of intelligence 
The least satisfactory aspect of the border in recent weeks has been the increasing extent to which groups of armed terrorists operating from south of the border have carried out hit and run raids into Northern Ireland- often aimed at easy targets, such as membersof the police and the Ulster Defence Regiment in their own homes. 
These attacks are as Vicious and cowardly as anything that we have seen from the IRA in the past year 
- and that is saying a good deal; 
but they are clearly difficult to combat, so long as the perpetrators are able to return to a safe base across the border.

We have of course encouraged the authorities in Dublin to take vigorous and effective action against these terrorists in their midst, as much in their own interest as ours. 
The arrests by the Gardai in Dundalk on 28 January, to which I have already referred, are a welcome sign that such action is in hand: though it would perhaps be unwise to jump to too many conclusions before knowing the outcome of today’s committal proceedings againstthe seven arrested men. 
It is not my intention, in saying his, to interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic. But when continuous raids are being conducted over this section of the border, leaving every sort of terror and destruction in their wake, we clearly have a legitimate interest in what is being done to prevent them.

Another very important theme in the campaign against the terrorists is that of propaganda. 
It is perfectly clear that the IRA realise the importance of public opinion, and they go to great lengths to put about distorted accounts of the situation and of the operations against them. 
Indeed, senior officers serving in Northern Ireland have commented more than once that the IRA seem at times to be conducting a propaganda war, with a certain amount of shooting and bombing in support of it, rather than vice versa - 
and there is clearly a grain of truth in this. 
We are equally aware of the importance of this factor; and a great deal has been done to ensure that the IRA’s propaganda is shown up as the lie that it is, and that the truth goes on record. 
But this is no easy task: it is sadly true that sensational allegations are always more likely to catch the headlines than accurate statements of fact showing that an allegation is quite untrue.

My Lords, while these particular aspects which I have mentioned are all very important factors in the security situation, there can be no doubt that the central problem is the present antagonism of a large part of the Catholic community for the Northern Ireland Government and for the forces of law and order. 
It may be thought - and certainly I myself think - that this antagonism is quite irrational. 
I really do not see how these 
people can believe that, without the terrorists, they would be in any danger of attack from any quarter, least of all from the Army itself. 
But, irrational or not, this fear is a fact 
which stems from it. 
Of course, intimidation by the IRA plays no small part in this. But the sad fact is that for reasons that go beyond intimidation a sizeable part of the Catholic community is sympathetic to the terrorists and is willing in varying degrees to afford them shelter and even positive assistance. 
- and so is the hate and bitterness

My Lords all the experience of previous campaigns against internal subversion and insurgency and for that matter commonsense - suggests that there is a limit to the ability of the security forces to eliminate terrorism altogether, unless and until one can isolate the terrorists from the rest of the community 
- and I believe this is the position we now see in Northern Ireland. 
The key question therefore must be how to regain the confidence of the Catholic community. 
This of course is a question which takes 
one beyond the purely military field and involves questions of politics. 
My Lords I believe there is quite general recognition for the argument that the Catholic community in Northern Ireland are entitled to expect some significant measure of political change, and that it is only through such change that the confidence of that community can be regained.

There are three points about which the Government’s position is perfectly clear. 
First, there can be no concession to violence and terrorism. If there are to be changes, it must be because they are justified on their merits and not simply because they offer a possibility of placating the gunmen for a little while. 
Second, on the question of possible unification, there can be absolutely no question of forcing the majority of people of Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom against their wishes. As my right honourable Friend the Prime Minister said in his speech at the Guildhall on 15th November last 
"if at some future date the majority of the people in Northern Ireland want unification and express that desire in the appropriate constitutional manner, I do not believe any British Government would stand in the way".

It is entirely in their own interests that they should do so; for unless the canker of the minority’s bitterness and resentment can be healed, we may all be sure that this will not be the last eruption of violence and terrorism in Northern Ireland. 
My Lords, the difficulties in achieving political advance are thus truly formidable. 
The security forces for their part, will maintain the pressure on the terrorists, while continuing to adapt their tactics to changes and improvements in the situation. At the same time we shall continue to encourage discussions about how to secure a proper place for the minority in the life of the Province 
- while continuing to uphold 
the right of the majority to choose whether to remain a part of the United Kingdom. 
The Home Secretary’s invitation to all parties in Northern Ireland to engage in talks remains open.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 63 26 JANUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours Yesterday’s events displayed two features which have increasingly 
characterised the security scene since the a. 
nning of this week: 
a pattern of attacks on members of the RUC and its Reserve, usually by gunmen operating from cars; 
b. 
a pronounced concentration of terrorist activity in the south-east corner of the Province. 
Both these trends - if that is what they prove to be - are consistent 
with the aim which was reportedly agreed at the Provisional’s staff meeting at Cavan on 17 January (Report No 60, paragraph 9 refers), that the Active Service Units operating from the Republic should concentrate their attacks on local elements of the security forces, i.e. the RUC and UDR. The second trend is also consistent with the presence of Martin Meehan in Dundalk, where it is fairly clear that he has taken charge of the direction of operations (especially since the arrest in Northern Ireland of Sean Collins). 2.. 
The policeman (Sergeant Edward Kelly) who was machine-gunned 
outside his home at Newry yesterday morning remains very seriously i During the afternoon, in Belfast outside a cinema in Ormeau Road, tw constables of the RUC Reserve were shot and wounded, one of them. seriously. 3. 
in Londonderry. At a point on the border west of Keady, a mobile patrol came under fire from the other side of the border. There we no military casualties in any of these incidents. In Belfast a girl of sixteen was injured when a nail bomb was thrown at a military police vehicle in Springfield Road. 
Altogether there were six shooting incidents in Belfast and fiv

4. In the early hours of this morning, during a bomb attack on the 
RUC station at Castlewellan, Co. Down, one civilian was killed and another injured. Present indications are that they were actually involved in the attack and were blown up when their bombs failed to clear the wire and exploded at their feet. Shortly after this, there were further explosions at the telephone exchange in Castlewellan and nearby at the Field Study Centre at Bryansford. There was one explosion during the day in Londonderry but none in Belfast. 5. 
The police reservist (Constable Patrick Rooney) who disappeared 
on Monday evening while on his way to report for duty at Newry RUC station (Report No 62, paragraph 5) turned up there at 11 p.m. last night. He claimed to have been held up by two masked men at a petrol station, blindfolded and taken to a house for questioning being left, again 
- before blindfolded, just south of the border. He 
had not been ill-treated. His pistol and warrant card are missing. 5. 
Machine-gun attack in Lurgan on 24 January 6. 
A check is being made on a suggestion put forward in a London

Anti Internment Rallies 6. 
Rallies to demonstrate against internment were held on Saturday at 
Armagh and outside Magilligan Camp, and on Saturday at Lurgan and Castlowellan. Substantial crowds collected on each occasion and were addressed by speakers who included SDLP Members of Parliament at Westminster and Stormont. 
On 
each occasion the Security Forces were present in strength and were able to ensure that nothing which could be described as a march developed the demonstrators were kept apart from Protestant spectators.

NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 14 JANUARY 1972 
- 20 JANUARY 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
Further discussions have been held on the arrangements for talks between the 
parties at Westminster. In Northern Ireland the ban on parades has been extended for a year, but defiance is planned by ’Loyalist’ as well as civil rights organisations. 
PARADES 2. 
The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland announced on 18 January that the 
existing ban on parades would be extended for a further 12 months when it expires on 8 February. The decision had been taken, he said, in order to prevent people from exposing the security forces and themselves to unnecessary dangers, and to enable the security forces to concentrate on the effort against terrorists. The situation would be 
pt under review so that, if the situation permitted, a 
relaxation of the ban might be considered. 3. 
The ban has been opposed by Mr Paisley, Mr Craig and some Unionist MPs (who 
have complained in particular about the failure to consult "loyalist" organisations beforehand), as well as by the Social Democratic and Labour Party. 
A motion of censure on the Government for its decision has been signed by two members of the Unionist Party 
4. - Captain Mitchell and Mr Laird - as well as three 
members of the Democratic Unionists and Mr Craig. The motion is due to be debated on 25 January. 
The Loyalist Workers’ Association, led by William Hull, has declared its 
opposition to the ban and plans to march in defiance of it. So has the Civil Rights Association. Spokesmen for the Orange Order, and other Protestant organisations associated with traditional parades have expressed opposition to the decision. 
5. Anti-internment marches are being planned in spite of the ban, and one in 
Armagh for 22 January may be accompanied by a Protestant counter-demonstration. INTER-PARTY TALES 6. 
In December the Labour Party had announced that it would be seeking an 
assurance from the Government that any subject could be raised during the proposed inter-party talks. (See HONIP(71) 51 paragraph 5). On 14 January the Home Secretary replied to a letter from Mr Callaghan which had asked for this assurance confirming that any relevant topic could be raised, although those who joined in the talks would do so without prejudice to their known positions. The Home Secretary added that, since the opposition parties in Northern Ireland were maintaining their refusal to participate in talks,the next step might be for discussions between the Opposition and Government at Westminster to be renewed. On 19 January the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary met Mr Wilson to discuss the proposed talks.

some prominene in today’s Press, but it is understood that the RUC intend to assert quite openly that the murder can only have been for the purposes of preventing the victim from giving evidence and of discouraging other potential witnesses in this and other cases. 8. 
It will be important to record all such evidence, whether or 
not substantiated, of IRA intimidation: since it will be crucial to the British response to the case being brought by the Irish Government before the Commission on Human Rights at Strasbourg, so far as it is concerned with internment as an alleged violation of Article Five 
- intimidation being the basic reason why the terrorists 
cannot be dealt with through the normal processes of the law. Details are accordingly being sought of another new development which has been reported, that about six of the civilian labourers employed at Magilligan Camp have left as a result of intimidation. There may also be evidence of attempts to intimidate some of the warder staff at the internment camps. Arrest of Sean Collins 9. 
Collins, a senior figure in the Provisional IRA - who was arrested in Newry on the night of 13 January - is being charged with 
a wounding offence committed in 1969. A check is being made of whether the fact of being charged necessarily prevents him from undergoing ordinary Special Branch interrogation, as the RUC have suggested it does. 10. Today’s Irish newspapers carry reports alleging that Collins was kidnapped - and/or the SAS - 
either by rival elements of the IRA, or by the RUC in Dundalk, south of the border, before being taken 
to Northern Ireland. The RUC have put out a statement dismissing these reports as nonsense Possible use of a launcher for nail bombs 11. There is a report, as yet unconfirmed that the IRA in Londonderry are experimenting with some form of launcher to project nail bombs against the security forces. If this is true, it seems

Irish Ministers 
had refrained from commenting publicly on the situation in Northern Ireland in recent weeks because they did not wish to prejudice any political initiative which might be in prospect. 
It would, however, be difficult 
that such camps ought not be located in remote, inaccessible places, but reasonably near the centres of population, so that relatives could visit internees. The reason why an additional camp was needed was ghat more and more wanted men were being arrested and it was because of this that the IRA were now in some difficulty. He had pointed out some time ago to Mr. Lynch that, if internment were to be introduced in the South as well as in the North, as it had been during the previous IRA campaign, much quicker and more effective action could be taken against the terrorists. He had however refrained from taxing Mr. Lynch publicly with this. Mr. Lynch had to realise that an immediate release of all internees, as the SDLP had proposed, was quite unacceptable.

undermine the original view that this programme was likely to be helpful. 
Nothing emerged from these discussions to Internment policy 
17. The latest available figures for internments, detentions and releases are attached at Annex. 18. The opening of Magilligan Camp on Sunday, with the transfer of forty detainees from HMS MAIDSTONE, has given rise to a good deal of speculation about the future of internment generally and, in particular, about the number of people whom the security authorities think it will be necessary to intern in order to render the IRA ineffective. 
There can in fact be no exact answer to this question 
since, although we have a fairly clear idea of the number of activists that there were in each wing of the IRA immediately before internment, it is clear that they have been able to recoup at least some of their losses with new recruits 
- though it in also very 
clear that, in the process, the competence which their operations are conducted has fallen away considerably. 19. In the event of a more pronounced lull in terrorism 
may well be a case for some acceleration in the rate of release of internees 
- it will of course be important to know a good deal 
about how relatively dangerous each of them is. The Northern Ireland Government have made practically no headway so far in sorting the internees physically into categories 
- for which they are apparently 
now laying the blame on the shortage of accommodation which has obtained hitherto. However, the Advisory Committee under Judge Brown has by now reviewed, at least once, the case against about threequarters of those interned; they should therefore have some idea of those who might qualify for release if the criteria wre altered somewhat. 20.

HQ NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL FEBRUARY 1972 
0700 HRS 18 
General 1. The week has seen a further reduction in the numbers of shooting incidents. Although military casualties are well down they contain two particularly brutal murders; a soldier 
visiting his sick and widowed mother in Dublin, and a UDR busdriver. A number of the shooting incidents have also involved IRA ’Justice’. Bomb attacks remain at last Week level but were concentrated mainly in Belfast. However, it is too soon to say whether this is a real reversal of recent trends. For the first time a bomb was found on a ferry, the Heysham/Belfast ferry on 17 February. The bomb, consisting of 40 lbs of gelignite in a suitcase, failed to explode because of a malfunction. 
2. Two ’marches’ took place during the period. The first, at Enniskillen on Sunday, was not a success. The organisers initially stated that 20,000 would attend. In the event, some 1,200-1,500 took part, nearly all of the ’Rent-a-crowd’ type from elsewhere in the Province and from Eire. There was no confrontation with the Security Forces. The other, at Londonderry on Thursday, was in protest against the murder of the UDR busdriver. It was orderly, Protestant, and did not breakthe ban because the 1,000 who took part kept to the pavements. They walked from Altnagelvin to Ebrington Barracks where they expressed disgust at the murder, concern about the lawlessnss of the Croggan and Bogside and support for the Security Forces. 
3. Following recent successful escapes, two further attemps took place at Crumlin Jail, on 12 February, and Magilligan, on 16 February.. Both were thwarted by the prison staff. Two 
accomplices were captured outside Crumlin Jail by 2 RRF. 4. Attacks on the homes of UDR resulted in the loss of four more SLRs. On two other occasions the gunmen, failed in their attempts. 
5. In two successful clashes with gunmen, 45 Cdo RM captured two terrorists in Ligoniel on 13 February, and an RUC patrol captured three more, (one of whom is under suspicion for the murder of a soldier in Lurgan on 7 November 1971) following an attempted wages snatch at Lurgan on 17 February. 
Propaganda 
6. The big propaganda issue is the Widgery Tribunal. Its terms of reference have been attacked as being too narrow and preventing investigation of decisions loading up to thu shootings in Londonderry. The Tribunal’s impartiality has been questioned on the lines that it is the British establishment which is on trial and an appointee of the establishment cannot be impartial. Demands for an international member on the tribunal have been made. Attacks on the impartiality of Lord Widgery have laid stres on his war record. The SDLP MP John Hume made the running in this campaign. By the end of the week,

more favourable views began to be heard. Father Paul, for 
examples said that the civilians should perhaps cooperate if there was no other way of getting the facts established. The seven Londonderry priests decided on February 17 that they will appear. 
7. Allegtions of brutality continue. Fathers Paul and Murray are making army doctors their target. The Irish News of 
February 17 printed a copy of a letter sent to the British Medical Association and the Medical Practitioners’ Union, which accused Army doctors of unthical paticipation in interrogation. The BMA and BMU are asked to investigate thse serious allegations. 
8. The same issue carried two stories, which inferred that the leal profession is increasingly opposing certain aspects of the security operation.

10. In the evening of 11 February four armed men broke into the houses of UDR soldiers in the Armagh area and stole three SLRs and 60 rds of ammunition. On 16 February an ACF cadet was kidnapped and questioned for two hours by four masked men near Armagh. This is the first incident involving cadets. On 13 February the body of a RAOC Private soldier serving in Northern Ireland was found Last of the border town of Newtonbutler. He was officially on leave to visit his ailing mother in the Republic. He had been bound and gagged and then shot in the back of his head.

You mentioned to me that the Prime Minister wished to

25 percent (or 150) of the present internees - are mostly those who actually throw the bombs and fire the rifles. They

obviously with some reluctance - that all the people in this category of least danger could be progressively released if political considerations ade this desirable 
Nevertheless the Army would accept in principle - 
that the political initiative was not followed by a major set back, (It would be greatly preferable to wait until those in the category of least danger had been physically separated from the others, and had experienced at least a short period away from the hardore category, before starting to release them).

As regards new internments, we would be totally opposed to calling a complete halt, while being prepared to see greater 
selectivity. We quite apreciate that the political impact 
would be greater if it could be announced that, along with accelerating the release of those already interned, there would be no further internment orders: but there are important security reasons for not doing this. The morale and operational effectiveness of the IRA, and hence their level of intimidation, 
would inevitably rise the moment they knew that arrests under the Special Powers Act had stopped. It has to be remembered that the substantial progress which has been made in Belfast, 
to be pursued with such vigour, that the number of effective terrorists remaining at large within the city can be gauged.

limit future new internments selectively to ring leaders of whom a number of the most important are still at large, But the Army consider it vital that the option should remain of detaining and interning terrorists who are captured in the rural areas, where the intelligence picture is less complete and the IRA may well build up their activities. 
Further, the Army’s willingness to see a larger 
number of the present internees released rests on the assumption that it will still be possible to re-arrest any who are found to be engaging in violence again. If that power no longer exists, the situation even in Belfast could quickly deteriorate again as those who are released come back into circulation. It will be necessary to keep a very close watch on whether the first releases are followed by any significant move towards reprisals against the Security Forces, especially the RUC Special Branch and the rest of the intelligence community, who will be extremely vulnerable at that stage. There should be no relaxation of the present requirement that before an internee can be released he must first sign an undertaking not to engage in unlawful activity (though the form of the present oath or affirmation may need to be modified). 
The Army hope that those internees who are released 
can be made subject to some form of licence or probation we understand that the legal means may exist to do this. But whether or not that practice is adopted, we consider it essential 
- at least for the first few months - to 
have the sanction of re-arrest and re-internment available. The Northern Ireland Government will, of course, 
have views about all this and we must expect them to be much influenced by the attitude of the RUC Special Branch which we know to be strongly opposed to a release rate which is more than marginally faster than is now being achieved. The matter is due to be discussed at the next meeting of the Joint Security Committee on 17th February and I will let you know the outcome of that meeting as soon as possible, That said, however, it is difficult to see how any policy less forthcoming than the one I have outlined above could make much of a contribution towards a successful political package.

HQ NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING General 1. 
during and after the illegal NICRA march on Sunday 30 January and its repercussions throughout the Province. 
The week has been dominated by the events in Londonderry Those took the form 
of widespread demonstrations, protest meetings, token strikes and closures, and intimidation as well as an upsurge in violence, particularly in Belfast. 
It has boon most noticeable that those areas of Belfast where the IRA. have been hardest hit - Ardoyne, New Lodge, Markets and 
place in those areas whore the IRA still has considerable influence and the power to intimidate 
West Belfast. 3. 
Conversely, the vast majority has taken - the Falls, West and South 
2. 
East Belfast, have played very little part in the reactions to the Londonderry shootings. 
In the early part of the week terrorist attacks continued and of bombs in parked stolen cars, particularly in Belfast. 
Bomb attacks continued with increasing use being made One 
assassination attempts were made on police officers and UDR members as well as sniping and ambush attacks on security force patrols and posts. 
policeman and one soldier have been killed during the week while nin regular soldiers, a UDR sldier and three policemen were wounded. A number of civilians have also been injured by terrorist bombs and gunfire. Arrest operations have continued. 
NICRA March - Sunday 30 January 4. 
The illegal NICRA. march in Londonderry on Sunday 30 January followed the prediction made before the event. 
The organisers, 
intent on defying the ban, led the marchers into direct confrontation with the Security Forces and lost control of the hooligan element. Arrest squads of 1 PARA, which were sent in to arrest the rioters, came under attack from IRA gunmen and bombers. In the exchanges of fire 13 people were killed and 15 wounded, 5 soldiers received minor injuries. 
5. The whole incident is now sub judice pending the investigation 
by the Widgery Tribunal. Propaganda 6. 
amongst Catholics in the North as well as moderates in the Republic. There were signs that the Irish Government might be steeling itself to curb IRA activities, particularly in border areas. NICRA marches had been poorly attended. 
By mid-January 1972 the IRA was in danger of losing support Several It was therefore vital 
for the IRA that Irish emotions should be aroused and commonsense set aside, if their campaign to achieve a united Ireland by force was to succeed.

in it escaped. Two caches of arms were found in Belfast on Friday, totalling four firearms and 2300 rounds of ammunitions and some explosives material was found in Ballymurphy on Sunday. Possibilities of Protestant terrorism 9. 
Both wins ofthe IRA have denied responsibility for the 
Abercorn Restaurant explosion, and have sought to pin it on Protestant extremists. However, this may well be simply because they have realised how much revulsion it has caused. The RUC, who are fairly ell in touch with the plans of Protestant extremists, have no reason 
to suppose that this was their work; and it has the usual characteristics of an attack by the rovisionals. Some of the other events of the weekend are open to the suggestion that they were the ork of Protestants. The fatal shooting of a soldier in the Shankill on Friday is perplexing - 
although it is believed that the gunman 
made his escape by car, and might therefore have come from any where. Catholics were the victims of the explosion in Plevna Street on Saturday 
- but the bomb might for various reasons have been left in 
the deserted house by the IRA. The shots at Catholic youths on Sunday evening are not easily explained as IRA activity: there is little information about this incident on which to form a view either way. 
Political activity 10. The Ulster Vanguard held two rallies on saturday afternoon at Coleraine and Ballymeena 
- attracting rather over 2,000 people in 
the first case and about 1,600 in the second. Roth were uneventful. 11. On Sunday afternoon an attempt was made to stage an illegal march against internment from Pomeroy to Carrickmore. This one, unlike those of the past fortnight, apparently had the backing of NICRA and the SDLP collectively, as well as Miss Devlin personally. About 1,000 people had collected by the time the march approached Carrickmore, where it was halted by the police outside the town. Most of them then dispersed, but about 350 re-assembled on a disused railway line

IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DECIDED TO CONTINUE THE COMIISSION IN ITS DEVELOPMENT FUNCTIONS, RELIEVING IT OF ITS PPESENT NUNICIPAL FUNCTIONS, WHICH WOULD OF COURSE HAVE TO PASS TO THE NEW LOCAL AUTHORITY. 5.

’’YOU MAY ASK WHY IT IS, AS SO MANY OF THE IRA LEADERS ARE REMOVED FROM THE SCENE, THAT THE CAMPAIGN CONTINUES? IT CCNTINUES -

THAT IS WHY IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT

accepted as fair and reasonable throughout Ireland, thereby making possible on an all-Ireland basis determined action, with public approval, against terrorist organisations. 
4. While it would clearly be unrealistic to expect any of the Parties in the Irish Republic to shed their aspiration for the ultimate unity of Ireland, an attempt should be made to seek a realistic measure of agreement which takes account of the declarations by Mr Lynch and others that unity must be sought through agreement, and not through any form of coercion. 
5. Two previous attempts have been made to achieve a basis of agreement for the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. The "Treaty" of 6 December 1921 (as scheduled in the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922) gave the Houses of the Northern Ireland Parliament the right, by Address, to opt out of the new Irish Free State, and provided for a Boundary Commission. The Agreement of 3 December 1925, having reached the understanding that the Report of the Boundary Commission should not be published, fixed the extent of Northern Ireland for the purposes of the 1920 Act. These agreements, however, were for all practical purposes unilaterally repudiated by the promulgation, by Mr De Valera, of a Constitution which purported to claim the right to jurisdiction in the whole of Ireland. 
6. It is our view that a major contribution to peace and good government in both parts of Ireland would be made by an attempt to reach a solemn and binding Agreement on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Such an Agreement would have to acknowledge the present constitutional position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom; accept the validity of efforts either to maintain that position or to secure a change in it by lawful, constitutional means only; and provide for an acceptable mechanism through which the people of Northern Ireland could decide in the future whether they wished to retain the present position or to change it. 
7. We would regard a Referendum, with an electorate consisting of all those entitled to vote at Elections to the Parliament of Northern Ireland, as a suitable mechanism for this purpose. It should, in our view, be subject to the following conditions:- 
a. Northern Ireland should be treated for the purposes of the Referendum as a single Constituency. The voting arrangements should, as far as possible, be such as to prevent the break-down of the overall figures on a local or

MEMORANDUM BY THE PRIME MINISTER AS MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS ON INTERNMENT 1. 
There has been considerable speculation in the press about the possibility 
of ending internment, and when I met Mr Heath on 4 February 1972 I has asked whether I saw any early prospects of its being phased out. 
I replied that I 
shared the view of the Army that it was vital to get on top of the IRA before making any move in this direction. 2. 
In spite of the continued bombings and shootings there is ample evidence 
that the effectiveness of the IRA,especially in the Belfast area where the security forces have recently concentrated their efforts, has been very seriously reduced. 
The removal from circulation of 700 - 800 members of the 
two main organizations is creating increasing problems for them in terms both of morale and losses of key personnel. 
made good, but the officers of some companies have had to be replaced two or three times over and volunteers are now reluctant to come forard. 
in Belfast have ceased to exist and others have been amalgamatod. 
areas have been completely cleared of IRA and increasing pressure is being brought to bear on areas where groups are still active. 3. 
technical skill in the use of explosives. These losses have to some extent been 
Some units Several 
In Belfast the IRA are particularly short of leadership, experience and Taking the situation in Northern 
Ireland as a whole, about 140 important members on the wanted list are now in the Irish Republic. 
The severe dislocation of command and communication systems 
has left behind something more in the nature of a cell structure, and operations are largely carried out by small active service units, many of them based in the South. 
It must be added that these are capable of inflicting casualties 
on the security forces and of maintaining limited attacks on civilian targets for some time to come, especially outside Belfast. 4. 
There are two answers to the claim that internment has not worked. 
The first is the fact, already noted, that the IRA presence has been removed from certain areas and that this is continuing; though it is unfortunately true that those who have most to fear from the IRA are least articulate in pointing to the comparative freedom from intimidation which they are beginning to enjoy. 
Secondly, insofar as internment has not yet succeeded, this is due in no small measure to the fact that there are many people outside the IRA who do not want it to work. 
They include those who while ostensibly deploring the methods of 
the IRA have little desire to see the IRA put out of action until some at least of the organization’s aims have been achieved. 
5. in IRA recruitment. 
There is little evidence that internment has led to a substantial increase On the contrary, recent arrests indicate that most of 
those taking part in terrorist attacks were recruited in the period leading up to August of last year. 
So far as those already interned are concerned, the

campaign to end internment and the belief that it rill succeed keeps their morale higher than is generally the case with men still at large. 6. In spite of successes against the IRA it may still be claimed that the present strategy of attrition offers steadily diminishing returns in terms of opportunities for a political settlement. 
It may indeed appear to some that efforts to secure 
a settlement cannot await the prior defeat of the IRA, or even the scaling down of violence to an acceptable level, and that there are greater chances of terminating violence by putting internment into reverse than by pursuing it to the bitter end. In pursuit of this argument it might be argued that internees should now be released at the rate of, say, 50 per month and that the rate might be increased as the situation improved; conversely that it should be cut back if there were no improvement, and that all releases should stop if a further deterioration occurred. 
Alternatively there might be a programme of releases geared to the progress of talks with the Northern Ireland opposition. 
The possibility of phasing out internment in this way has been studied, but is open to the following objections:- 
(1) All internees are, on the evidence available, either members of the IRA or otherwise involved in terrorism, and there is no pool of mere political activists from which releases can be made. 
There is, therefore, the likelihood that internees 
released as a political gesture would return to their previous activities and so repair the substantial damage which has been inflicted on both factions of the IRA since 9 August 1971. (2) If internees were released prematurely, ie before the IRA were defeated, the prime targets for retaliatory action would undoubtedly be the members of the Special Branch of the RUC: these are for the most part known to those internees whom they have arrested or interrogated. (3) The IRA would regard any programme of release for political reasons as an important success. 
and the general public. 
It would also be so regarded by members of the Security Forces The IRA could, therefore, dictate future terms. 
(4) Any decision to make no further arrests would be regarded by the IRA as a still greater achievement; they could be expected to take the opportunity to recoup their losses and to equip themselves to intensify operations at a date of their own choosing. 
Those on the run would be encouraged to return to their units. 
(5) The process of internment has provided, and continues to provide, a flow of intelligence on the membership, resources and plans of the IRA. 
interrupted the IRA could re-group with impunity. 7. 
If this flow were The Joint Security Committee have noted these conclusions and have accepted

that security grounds rule out any releases other than through the machinery of the Advisory Committee. 
a serious risk of the prolongation of the terrorist campaign. 8. 
Any other course would it is felt carry with it It is difficult to visualize any solid advantages which might outweigh 
these security objections. It may well be that internment continues to be the main cause of Catholic alienation and that it has attracted to the IRA the sympathy of sections of the Catholic population which would otherwise have no use for terrorism. 
ut it can hardly be supposed that the confidence of the minority 
is to be on back by letting the gunman loose to reimpose their will in areas from which they have been expelled. 9. 
defeated can in any way assist towards a political solution. 
Nor is it easy to see how the ending of internment before the IRA are The opposition 
have no control over the IRA and therefore no means of bringing terrorism itself under control. 
And even if a total or partial ending of internment enabled 
political talks to start a fully armed terrorist organization in the background with its ranks re-filled would inevitably dominate the course of any negotiations. 10. 
If it is accepted that there is no painless way of ending internment it 
will be necessary to say so publicly and to face the unfavourable reactions which will inevitably follow.In order to minimize these reactions certain steps can, however, be taken 
(1) The need for internment to continue may have to be spelt out more effectively. For this purpose it is proposed to give as much publicity as possible 
to a general defence of the policy and to the correcting of some of the grosser forms of misrepresentation to which it has been subjected. 
to include proposals for ending internment as soon as the IRA campaign ceases. (2) 
There will be greater stress on the easing of conditions under which 
internees live, including better welfare facilities and provision for rehabilitation. (3) 
Amending Regulations have already been drafted and will shortly be made 
which will remove some criticism of existing procedures as being too arbitrary. (4) 
As indicated in a separate memorandum, legislation is under consideration 
which would have the effect of putting the Special Powers Acts into suspense on termination of the present emergency. 
It may also be possible

events during the week: 
a. The positive moves being taken against the IRA in Eire, partly because of the ineffectiveness of magistrates courts and partly as a result of the Aldershot explosion in which 5 women, a civilian and an RC Padre were killed and which drew universal condemnation. 
b. The change of 3 Stormont MPs to the Alliance Party; a move which for the first time, gives a non-sectarian party seats in Stormont. 
c. The attempt by John Hume, and others, to seriously restrict the Army’s powers of search and arrest without warrant. 
Although he succeeded in obtaining a favourable 
judgment in the Northern Ireland High Court, Westminster passed an anabling Bill within 7 hours to leave the Army’s powers unaltered. 
Operationally, there has been an increase in shooting 
incidents, almost entirely due to a major attempt to inflict casualties on Security Forces in Londonderry on 20 February.

28 FEBRUARY 1972 Incidents in the last 72 hour The level of terrorist activity showed some reduction on 
that 
of the previous weekend, equated almost exactly with the average of the past three weeks in February. Altogether there were 39 shooting incidents, 13 explosions and six armed robberies. 2. 
The shooting incidents were spread fairly evenly over the three 
days, and between Belfast, Londonderry and other areas. They o course included the attack on r. John Taylor in Armagh on Friday, when nine bullets were fired at him and four hit him - as has already been fully reported in the Press. The only fatality was in Londonderry on Friday, where a youth died after being admitted to hospital with gunshot wounds: he had not been involved in an exchange of shooting with the security forces. There was one case of fire being exchanged across the border on Sunday; and on the same day there were several outbreaks of shooting in Dungannon in which the security forces were not involved. 3. 
Most of the explosions were fairly minor; but as a result of 
three explosions which occurred in Belfast on Friday, two policemen and several civilians received minor injuries. 4. 
There was a certain amount of the usual hooliganism in 
Londonderry on Friday and Saturday. There was also an outbreak of it at Newry on Saturday, when one soldier was slightly injured. in Belfast on Saturday a bus carrying Catholic football supporters was attacked by a band of about 100 Protestants and had to be escorted out of the area; this did not have the appearance of a premeditated attack by one community on the other. 5. 
There were fifteen arrests of wanted persons during the weekend, 
as well as 36 routine arrests. The wanted men who were picked up included the ’intelligence officer’ of the Andersonstown battalion of

Two large explosions in Belfast caused extensive damage to within five minutes of one another. The first 
was in a car hire firm and the second at the British Oxygen Corporation’s premises; in each case a few minutes warning was given. A bomb exploded in the bus depot at Antrim and damaged four buses seriously and a further nine slightly. There was one explosion in Londonderry. 7. 
A new variety of booby trap was encountered at Newtownbutler, 
Co. Fermanagh , when a RUC patrol came cross what at first sight was a corpse 
- which had even been hooded in the same way as recent 
victims of assassinations by the IRA. It was in fact a tailor’s dummy with wires connecting it to a claymore mine at the wayside. The patrol was able to move the dummy with ropes and detonate the nine harmlessly. 8. 
There were twelve arrests of wanted persons, including two officers of e Brady IRA.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 101 20 MARCH 1972 
Incidents in the last 72 hours The two large rallies of the weekend - 
by the Ulster Vanguard on Saturday and by the Catholics on Sunday - have been fully reported 
in the Press. Army observers estimated that 51,000 people attended the former and 11,000 the latter. Each took place in an area of Belfast well clear of the other community’s residential areas, and each was well controlled by its stewards, so that the scope for confrontations was thus minimal; and fears that there might be trouble around Ballymacarratt or the Unity Flats as the Protestants made their way home on Saturday evening were fortunately not borne out. A check is still being made on whether there were any attempts by those attending the Vanguard rally to form processions afterwards; first indications are that there is little foundation for the centrepage report in the ’Guardian’ that a procession formed in Templemore Avenue. Sunday’s participants certainly did stage an illegal march, but the RUC deemed it wisest not to intervene at the time. 2. 
Former members of the B Specials (USC) were prominent on 
Saturday, forming up in ranks at the rally in Ormeau Park. One television report mentioned that there were 800 of them. 3. 
There was a fair amount of terrorist activity during the weekend, 
including 47 shooting incidents, 14 explosions and 13 border incidents. Eleven soldiers and a policeman received injuries varying from serious to slight. 4. 
Five of the military casualties were the outcome of shooting 
incidents in Londonderry (one on Friday and four on Saturday) and two in Belfast (one on Friday and one on Saturday, with one civilian being injured on each of these days as well). A gunman is believed to have been hit in an exchange of fire in londonderry on Sunday. There was one instance of firing cross the border on Friday, at

but there is no independent evidence available to show what occurred. .There have of course been various rumours that attempts might be made on the lives of Catholic politicians with the object of incriminating Protestant extremism. 8. 
During the weekend there were 27 arrests of wanted persons and 
22 routine arrests. Widgery Inquiry 9. 
The BBC are keeping up their pressure to secure agreement to 
soldiers being allowed to take part in a 24 Hours programme on the Widgery report on the evening immediately following its publication; and an approach to this end was made by Keith Kyle to the Under Secretary of State (Army) during the weekend. 10. HQ Northern Ireland have reported that a ’Sunday Times’ Insight team is busy researching in londonderry for material for use in a feature on the Widgery inquiry. Insight’s previous record, plus the tone of the article in this Sunday’s ’Observer’, suggest that there may be a marked inclination on the part f some of the Press to call in question Lord Widgery’s findings when they come to be published, as having failed to take sufficient account of the Bogsiders’ version of the events of 30 January. There may then be difficult decisions to take on whether to proceed in some way against the newspapers concerned.

were we forced to make it, would only profit extremist Protestant elements and their supporters, and that we shall not hesitate to make it if we see the officers concerned still being libelled. The remedy is in his hands.

There may be some moderate Protestants who are prepared to contemplate the possibility of eventual unification, and in the meantime to work for a more non-sectarian basis of government which would give the Catholic minority a greater share. But it is clear that Your Majesty’s Ministers in Northern Ireland, while prepared to go a considerable way in constitutional reform, including enlarging the Senate and the House of Commons at Stormont and introducing a proportional system of representation to the House of Commons, would object in principle to the inclusion in a Government of men and women whose declared political aim is the eventual unification of Ireland. The ultimate objective for most of the Catholics in 
Northern Ireland continues to be unification. It seems unlikely, however, that most of them would wish to press for immediate unification, given the present economic disparity between Northern Ireland and the Republic, if they can be assured of a reasonable share in the affairs of the Province and an end to sectarian discrimination. The Government of the Irish Republic are also an 
important element in this, because the terrorists who are responsible for the explosions and shootings in Northern Ireland are in many cases based in the Republic. If any political initiative taken now can be of a kind which the Government of the Republic feels able to commend, there is

Prime Minister’s message about the expressed intention of the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs to circulate this supplement to their poets abroad. Thin could mean either that the circulation has already gone ahead, or that the origins of the plan are still bein investigated. Either way the Irish authorities may well be having some difficulty in drafting a reply. One newspaper has suggested that the DFA’s order for the supplement as as high as 100,000. 7. 
has come to light, entitled "Derry - Bloody Sunday" 
Another pamphlet about the events of 30 January in Londonderry - the RUC having 
seized a bundle of copies of it at th Great Victoria street Railway Station in Belfast, apparently after it had arrived from Dublin for distribution in the north. This niece contains reference to class warfare and to the miners’ strike, suggesting that it is the product of the Official IRA. It is poorly edited and less effective than the pamphlet written by McCann and issued by the ’Socialist Worker’ Nevertheless it is significant that although the new pamphlet appeared in Belfast on 4 March it refers to General Ford giving evidence to the Widgery Tribunal, which only happened on 3 March. This seems indicative of the amount of effort which the IRA are prepared to devote to maintaining the pressure of their propaganda campaign. 
Possibilities of Protestant terrorism 8. 
No new evidence has emerged which tends to support the idea 
that the bombing of the Abercorn Restaurant on Saturday was the work of Protestants 
- but rather the reverse. The telephone call which 
was made about sixty seconds before the explosion has been traced to a pub which is well known as a Provisionals’ haunt. 9. 
which have no clear explanation, there has been just one definite case recently of terrorism by Protestants. On 28 February, in the Springfield Road area of Belfast, a Catholic named Lawrence Murtagh was fired upon by two armed men outside the Star Bar, where he was

10. There are no indications at present that this was intended as a attack by one faction.against another, as opposed to normal climate: and it would be unsafe to deduce from this incident that Protestant extremism had taen a definite turn towards violence.

- without its magazine - home of a UDR sergeant near Londonderry on Friday. 
The immediate outlook 10. Clearly the prospect for a general improvement in the situation will be strongly influenced by how much violence there is during the next 48 hours while the Vanguard/LAW stoppage of work is in progress and while the IRA are still arguing about their future tactics. The attitude in some of the Protestant working class strong-holds in Belfast is very hard at the moment; this is predictable, and there is. probably little that can be done about it in the short term but it is apparent there is widespread misunderstanding in these areas of what HNG’s action really means. These people are therefore the most important target at present for the Government information services. As regards the RUC and the UDR, first indications encourage the hope that their loyalty will come through the present test. 11. There are also hopeful signs of a softening in the attitude of the Catholic communities. The SDLP statement was probably as good as could be hoped for; and it is thou ht significant that Bishop Philbin has broken his lengthy silence by telephoning the GOC on Saturday to say how much happier the Catholics felt. It seems reasonable to hope that any continuation of terrorism by the IA ill have little support among the Catholic communities. 12. It is clear that the Provisionals are sharply divided about what to do next. It is thought best not to make any official comment on the statement from the Provisionals in Londonderry proposing to call

MINISTERIAL BROADCAST These were the proposals which I put to Mr. Faulkner on Wednesday. We had hoped that he and his colleagues might 
see their way clear to accepting them; I was very sorry when he told me that they could not continue as the governmnt of Northern Ireland, if responsibility for law and order were transferred to Westminister. 
But 
we believe that nothing less than the proposals I have described will enable us to break out of the deadlock of the last few months. 
The government 
here in London is therefore obliged to take over, for the time being, full responsibility for the conduct of affairs in Northern Ireland. will stay in Northern Ireland as long as any faction seeks to or intimidate ordinary people.

We admire the steadiness and Now only you can take the 
decision to live together in peace. Successive British governments of both political 
parties have given two guarantees to the people of Northern Ireland: A guarantee that so long as a majority of the people of Northern Ireland express the wish to remain part of the United Kingdom, that wish will be honoured: and a guarantee that all sections of the community shall have their rightful opportunity to play a full part in the running of Northern Ireland. In taking the measures I have announced today this government is confirming and reinforcing both these assurances. 
These measures are not in themselves the final answer. 
Our aim is to make it possible for the people of Northern Ireland to come together to discuss their future and to create by agreement the conditions in which the communities can live in peace.

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE POSITION OF THE GOC AND HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ISLAND NEW 4. The GOC will remain responsible to the Chief of the General 
Staff, and through him to the Secretary of State for Defence, for the conduct of operations by the Armed Forces in Northern Ireland. He will of course act in close consultation with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. [If pressed: The detailed arrangements for such consultation are now being drawn up; I would prefer not to say any more about them at this stage.] WILL THE GOC HAVE OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE RUC? 5. 
will therefore continue, as Director of Operations, to co-ordinate the allocation of duties to the RUC where security operations are concerned.] WILL THE JOINT SECURITY COMMITTEE CONTINUE? 6. 
The GOC’s relationship to the RUC will remain unchanged. [He It is at present envisaged that the Joint Security Committee 
will remain in being; [if so, the GOC and the Chief Constable will Of course remain members of it.] 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE MEASURES JUST ANNOUNCED ON THE ARMY AND ITS OPERATIONS 
7. The Army will continue, as at present, to act in support of 
the civil authority in maintaining law and order. [The Army’s main tasks will thus remain unchanged: to prevent intercommunal clashes and to take such action as in necessary to counter terrorism. Precautionary steps have been taken to enable additional units to be moved to Northern Ireland if they should be required. 
IS IT TRUE THAT THE ADVICE GIVEN BY THE ARMY (IN A PAPER CONSIDERED BY THE JSC ON 17 FEBRUARY WAS THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE TO START 
RELEASING INTERNEES IN ANY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS? 8. It is not the practice to reveal the confidential advice 
given by military officers or by officials and I am not prepared either to confirm or to deny that advice of the kind described /wa s given on

was given on the future policy for internment. But I can say that the decision which I have just announced in relation to interment is fully endorsed by the Government’s professional military advisors. 
9. As my rt. hon. Friend the Home Secretary said in the House 
on the 28th of February, we are examining all means that night be used to oounter th terrorist activities of the IRA. The police are doing everything possible to bring to justice those responsible for the outrage at Addershot. [But as my rt. hon. Friend also said in the House yesterday, while we fully understand the feelings of those who argue that the IRA should be proscribed, the translation of these feelings into a law on the Statute Book presents considerable difficulty.]

TEXT OF A MINISTERIAL BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RIGHT HON. EDWARD I am speaking to you tonight as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland: and in particular to the people of Northern Ireland, whatever your job, your politics, or your religion. All of us have been horrified by the violence in Northern Ireland and by 
the suffering it has caused. As a Government we have been doing everything in our power to bring that violence and that suffering to an end. Because the United Kingdom Parliament and Government have the same duty towards the people of Northern Ireland as to the rest of the country property, and to give them - 
all of them - a fair say in the decisions that 
shape their future. No single measure can overcome the bitterness of the past few years - the bitterness indeed of far too much of Northern Ireland’s history. The Government have concluded after long and anxious thought that we must make possible a completely fresh start. And so we have worked out a set of proposals to provide this fresh start 
out of the vicious circle of violence and yet more violence. Last Wednesday I put these proposals to Mr. Faulkner: First, that the United Kingdom Government should take over responsibility 
for law and order in Northern Ireland. Second, that there should be a gradual reduction in internment beginning 
with those internees who could be released without unacceptable risks. Third, that the people of Northern Ireland should be given a chance as soon 
as it is practicable, and again at intervals later, to decide for themselves in a plebiscite whether or not they want to remain in the United Kingdom. These were the proposals which I put to Mr. Faulkner on Wednesday. We 
had hoped that he and his colleagues might see their way to accepting them. I was very sorry when he told me that he and his colleagues could not continue as the Government of Northern Ireland if responsibility for law and order were transferred to Westminster. But we believe that nothing less than the proposals I have described would enable us to break out of the deadlock of the last few months. The Government here in London is therefore obliged to take over for the time being full responsibility for the conduct of affairs in Northern Ireland. The Army will stay in Northern Ireland as long as any faction seeks to terrorise or intimidate ordinary people. There will be no let-up in the fight against terrorism. All the security forces will continue to have our full backing and support. I want, before I end, to say a special word to those of you who are our fellow citizens living in Northern Ireland. You are the ones who have had to endure the years of violence and fear. We admire the steadiness and courage with which you have done this. Now only you can take the decision to live together peace. 
- to protect their lives and - the fresh start which is needed if we are to break

MR FAULKNER AND HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMNT 
ALTHOUGH AGREEING WITH CERTAIN OF THE MEASURES PROPOSED, HAVE DEC. THAT ATHER THAN ACCEPT THE TRANSFER OF RESPONIBILITY OF LAW AND ORDR ONLY TO WESTMINISTER, THEY WOULD PREFER ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GO ERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND TO BE TRANSFERED TO H.M.G. THIS IS NOW BEING PUT IN HAND, AND A COMMISSION OF PERSONS RESIDENT IN, AND FULLY REPRESETATIVE OF, NORTHERN IRELAND WILL BE APPOINTED TO ADVISE AND ASSIST THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE. 
I DO NOT PRETEND THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING CONSTITUTES THE COMPLETE 
SOLUTION. OUR AIM, IS TO SING ABOUT A SITUATION IN WHICH A POLITICAL SOLUTION CAN BE FREELY DISCUSSED BY ALL CONCERNED FREE FROM THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE. THE MEASURES WE ARE NOW ADOPTING NECESSARILY DERIVE FROM THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE SITUATION AS IT IS NOW, AND THE NEED TO BRING THE MINORITY BACK TO POLITICAL PATHS WITHOUT CAUSING THE MAJORITY TO REACT DANGEROUSLY. 
THIS IS A DIFFICULT PERIOD - FOR US, FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
INDEED FOR THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. BUT THE SUCCESS OF THIS INITIATIVE WILL ALSO, IN SOME PART, DEPEND UPON THE SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR AIMS BY OUR FRIENDS OVERSEAS. AT THIS PARTICULARLY CRUCIAL TIME. IT IS IN MY VIEW ESSENTIAL FOR EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO BE DONE TO URGE MODERATION, RESTRAINT AND FLEXIBILITY ON ALL THE PARTIES CONCERNED. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE THOUGHT WHICH I KNOW YOU HAVE GIVEN TO THIS PROBLEM AND FOR THE UNDERSTANDING ATTITUDE WHICH YOU HAVE SHOWN. 
I AM 
CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL BE MAINTAINED DURING THE CORING WEEKS. ENDS. 3. YOU MAY ALSO 
, AT YOUR DISCRETION, REFER TO THE POPE’S MESSAGE 
ON ST. PATRICK’S DAY, ON WHICH YOU ILL HAVE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS SEPARATELY, AND STRESS THAT IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AT THIS PARTICULARLY CRUCIAL MOMENT THAT ANY STATEMENTS ON THE NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION SHOULD NOT ONLY BE RESTRAINED BUT SHOULD AVOID ANY REFERENCES wHICH COULD BE TAKEN TO ENCOURAGE INTRANSIGENCE IN THE FACE OF THIS POLITICAL INITIATIVE, ON THE PART OF EXTREMISTS IN EITHER THE PROTESTANT OR THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY DOUGLAS- HOME

BEGINS: QUOTE I AM SENDING YOU THIS MESSAGE THROUGH THE AMBASSADOR SO THAT YOU ARE FULLY INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT I WILL BE MAKING IN THE HOUSE AT 1000 HRS G M T. 
WE HAVE REPEATEDLY MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE HAVE NEVER BELIEVED THAT THE PROLEM OF NORTHERN IRELAND CAN BE RESOLVED BY PURELY MILITARY MEANS. YOU WILL RECLL THAT WHEN WE MET LAST AUTUMN AT CHEQUERS MR. MAUDLING WAS ABOUT TO LAUNCH HIS SCHEME TO GET INTER-COMMUNAL DISCUSSIONS GOING. BUT THERE WAS NO MOVE TOWARDS RECONCILIATION, AND OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES SHOWED SIGNS OF GETTING WORSE. WE THEREFORE DECIDED THAT A NEW AND MORE RADICAL EFFORT HAD TO BE MADE. 
AT OUR MEETING WITH MR. FAULKNER WE MADE IT PLAIN THAT THESE NEW AND MORE RADICAL MEASURES WERE NECESSARY IN NORTHERN IRELAND, INCLUDING THE TRANSFER OF RESPOSIBILITY FOR LAW AND ORDER FROM STORMONT TO WESTMINSTER. THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT WERE UNABLE TO AGREE TO THIS PROPOSAL. WE FOR OUR.PART DECIDED THAT WE COULD NOT ACQUIESCE IN THE CONTINUATION OF THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS, AND WE SHALL THEREFORE SHORTLY BE INTRODUCING A BILL TO TRANSFER ALL EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE POWERS NOW VESTED IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENT TO A UNITED KINGDOM MINISTER AND TO THE UNITED KINGDOM PARLIAMENT. THIS WILL BE A TEMPORARY MEASURE EXPIRING AFTER ONE YEAR UNLESS THE ESTMINSTER PARLIAMENT RESOLVES OTHERWISE. THE PARLIAMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND WILL STAND PROROGUED, BUT WILL NOT BE DISSOLVED. 
THE INCREASED BURDEN WHICH THE TRANSFER OF THE RESPONISIBILITY WILL BRING MEANS THAT IT ILL NO LONER BE POSSIBLE FOR THE HOME SECRETARY TO DISCHARGE THESE DUTIES IN ADDITION TO HIS MAY OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES. A SEPARATE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND WILL, THEREFORE, BE APPOINTED SHORTLY AND IT IS ASSUMED THAT HE WILL SPEND A GOOD DEAL OF HIS TIME IN NORTHERN IRELAND.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE WILL APPOINT A COMMISSION OF PERSONS RESIDENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND TO ADVISE AND ASSISTHIM. THE AIM WILL BE T PEOPLE FULLY REPRESENTATIVE OF NORTHERN IRELAND OPINION. 
I DO NOT PRETEND THAT WHAT WE ARE NOW DOING CONSTITUTES THE WHOLE SWER. MEANS MUST STILL BE FOUND WHICH WILL ENSURE FOR THE MINORITY D THE MAJORITY COMMUNITY AN ACTIVE, PERMANENT AND GUARANTEED ROLE THE LIFE AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS OF THE PROVINCE. OUR IMMEDIATE 
WE HAVE ALSO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT IN PRINCIPLE TO BRING INTERMENT TO AN END, WHEN RESPECT FOR THE LAW AND A NORMAL SITUATION OF ORDER HAVE BEEN RESTORED THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCE. AFTER RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED, WE WILL RELEASE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THOSE INTERNEES WHOSE FREEDOM IS NOT NOW CONSIDERED TO INVOLVE ANY UNREASONABLE RISK TO SECURITY. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND IS ESTABLISHING IMEDIATELY A PROCEDURE TO REVIEW EACH CASE PERSONALLY. IF THE MEASURES WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN LEAD, AS WE HOPE THEY WILL, TO A REDUCTION IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER FURTHER RELEASES: BUT THIS MUST OF COURSE DEPEND ON A CLEARLY ESTABLISHED IMPROVEMENT IN THE SECURITY SITUATION. AS LONG AS ACTIVE TERRORISM PERSISTS AND BOMBING AND SHOOTING CONTINUE, WE MUST RETAIN THE POWER TO ARREST AND INTERN THOSE WHO THERE IS GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED. 
THIS GOVERNMENT, AND ITS PREDECESSORS, HAVE GIVEN SOLEMN AND REPEATED ASSURANCES THAT THE.CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION OF NORTHERN IRELAND AS PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM WILL NOT BE CHAGED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND. I KNOW YOUR OWN FEELINGS ON THIS MATTER, AND I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR FIRM ADHERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLE THAT ONLY THROUGH PEACEFUL AGREEMENT IS UNIFICATION POSSIBLE. WE HAVE DECIDED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE PROVISIONS OF THE IRELAND ACT (1949) WHICH REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND PARLIAMENT TO ANY CHANGE IN THE BORDER REMAIN IN BEING iT WOULD NOW BE HELPFUL IF ARRANGEMENTS WERE TO BE MADE FOR THE VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND ON UNIFICATION TO BE MADE KNOWN FROM TIME TO TIME. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE TO PROVIDE FOR A SYSTEM OF REGULAR PLEBISCITES ABOUT THE BORDER, THE FIRST TO BE HELD AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND OTHERS AT INTERVALS OF A SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD OF YEARS THEREAFTER. AS I HAVE SO OFTEN SAID BEFORE, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY BRITISH GOVERNMENT WOULD STAND IN THE WAY OF THE PEACEFULLY EXPRESSED WISHES OF THE MAJORITY OF NORTHERN IRELAND CITIZENS. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH THIS CANNOT BE ASSURED, A PLEBISCITE SYSTEM SHOULD, WE CALCULATE, ENSURE A PERIOD OF STABILITY AND ENABLE NORTHERN IRISH POLITICS TO BE CONCENTRATED ON MATTERS OTHER THAN THE BORDER. 
PROPOSALS ARE PUT FORWARD AND.WILL BE ACTED UPON IN THE HOPE THAT THEY WILL SO CHANGE THE CLIMATE OF POLITICAL OPINION IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT DISCUSSIONS CAN BE RESUMED IN AN EFFORT TO REACH AGREEMENT ON A NEW WAY FORWARD. 
THIS IS A DIFFICULT PERIOD - DIFFICULT NOT ONLY FOR US, AND FOR 
NORTHERN IRELAND, BUT ALSO, I RECOGNISE FOR THE REPUBLIC, AND I WOULD HOPE THAT I CAN NOW LOOK TO YOU AND TO YOUR GOVERNMENT FOR ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO PREVENT TROUBLEMAKERS FROM EXACERBATING THE SUTUATION. THE PROTESTANTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND AREHAVING TO SWALLOW SOME HARSH MEDICINE: ANY SUGGESTION THAT, IN ADDITION TO CHANGES AT HOME, THEY MUST FACE IMMINENTLY A CHANGE IN THEIR NATIONAL STATUS, OR ANY SUGGESTION THAT THESE CHANGES ARE A VICTORY FOR THE I R A, WILL ONLY SERVE TO INCREASE THE CHANCE OF A BACKLASH. 
SUCH SUGGESTIONS WILL CERTAINLY BE FORTHCOMING FROM THE THOUGHTLESS, OR THE TROUBLEMAKERS, AND IN THESE CICUMSTANCES I HOPE YOU WILL USE YOUR INFLUENCE AND AUTHORITY TO MAKE IN PLAIN TO ALL CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC, AND TO ALL THOSE IN NORTHERN IRELAND WITH WHOM YOUR WORDS CARRY WEIGHT THAT THE ONLY COURSE THAT OFFERS ANY HOPE FOR PEACE IN IRELAND IS WHOLE-HEARTED CO-OPERATION WITH THE FORCES OF LAW AND ORDER, BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE BORDER. THIS DOES NOT MEAN ANYONE NEED ABANDON HIS VIEWS, BUT IT DOES MEAN ALL MUST FOLLOW YOUR LEAD IN INSISTING THAT PEACE AND JUSTICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS THE IMMEDIATE ISSUE. 
FINALLY I AM SURE YOU WILL RECOGNISEHOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THE ACTION WE ARE TAKING SHOULD BE ACCEPTED BY THE PROTESTANT COMMUNITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND BY PUBLIC AND PARLIAMENTARY OPINION IN BRITAIN. IN THIS CONTEXT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC SHOULD BE SEEN TO BE TAKING EFFECTIVE ACTION AGAINST THE I R A. I KNOW THAT THIS A PROBLEM WHICH IS VERY MUCH IN YOUR MIND AND I HOPE THAT, AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF OUR NEW INITIATIVE, THERE ARE SOME HELPFUL STEPS WHICH YOU WILL FEEL ABLE TO TAKE. UNQUOTE

WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS DESIGNED TO MEET THE PARTICULAR 
SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND AT PRESENT. OUR AIM IS TO BREAK THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENCE AND TO BRING ABOUT A SITUATION IN WHICH IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO BE FREELY DISCUSSED BY ALL CONCERNED FREE FROM THE THREAT OF TERRORISM. THE MEASURES WE ARE MOW ADOPTING ARE INTENDED TO DO THIS, AND TO BRING THE MINORITY BACK TO POLITICAL PATHS WITHOUT CAUSING THE PROTESTANT MAJORITY TO REACT DANGEROUSLY. THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT IS TO CREATE AND ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE ONCE AGAIN TO ESTABLISH IN NORTHERN IRELAND DURABLE INSTITUTIONS OF REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT WHICH ARE ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH COMMUNITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE MEASURES WE ARE TAKING ARE THE BEST AVAILABLE TO REACH THIS RESULT. I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE CRITICISED 
OUR POLICIES IN THE PAST. I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR THE FIRMNESS WITH WHICH YOUR ADMINISTRATION HAS WITHSTOOD SUCH PRESSURES AND I HOPE THAT IN THE UNITED NATIONS AND ELSEWHERE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THE LINE OF POLICY WHICH IT HAS HITHERTO FOLLOWED. I AM KEEPING IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH MR. LYNCH, FOR HE TOO IS 
MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE GROWTH OF IRA VIOLENCE WITHIN THE REPUBLIC ITSELF.

5. The increased burden which this transfer of responsibilities will 
entail means that it will no longer be possible for my right honourable Friend, the Home Secretary, to discharge these duties in addition to his many other responsibilities. A separate Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is therefore being appointed. He will be empowered to appoint a commission of persons resident in Northern Ireland to advise and assist him in the discharge of his duties. 
It will be our objective to invite to serve on this 
commission a body of persons fully representative of opinion in Northern Ireland. 
Internment: 6. 
First Alternative As soon as responsibility has been transferred an immediate review 
will be put in hand by this Government of all internment orders with a view to revoking as many of them as possible consistent with public safety. The Government have taken this decision after consultation with their military advisers. They have also consulted the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who agrees with this course. The pace of releases will depend on the state of public security and the effect upon it of the release of particular internees whose cases are under review. The more quickly terrorist activity by the IRA subsides, the more rapid will be the pace of release; but any increase in IRA activity will delay the process. Internment: Second Alternative 7. 
It is Her Majesty’s Government’s intention to release as soon as 
possible those internees about whom there is a reasonable degree of doubt as to the danger to security that their release would pose. Their release will be conditional on an undertaking not to take part in or encourage violence or illegal action. 8. 
It is hoped that upwards of /about/ 100 internees can be said to be 
in this category, and it is hoped to release them during the next few weeks. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is establishing immediately a procedure to review each case personally. 9. 
If the measures which Her Majesty’s Government have taken lead, 
as is hopedthey will, to a reduction in terrorist activity, it will be possible to consider further releases; but this must of course depend on a clearly established improvement in the security situation. 10. 
It is Her Majesty’s Government’s clear intention to bring 
internment to an end, when respect for the law and a normal situation of order have been restored throughout the Province.

11. However, as long as active terrorism persists and bombing and 
shooting continues, Her Majesty’s Government must retain the power to arrest and intern those whom there is good reason to believe are actively involved. 12. 
This Government, and its predecessors, have given solemn and 
repeated assurances that the position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom will not be changed without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. We have decided that it would now be appropriate if arrangements were made for the views of the people of Northern Ireland to be made known on this question from time to time. We therefore propose in due course to invite the House to provide for a system of regular plebiscites about the Border, the first to be held as soon as practicable in the near future and others at intervals of a substantial period of years thereafter. The plebiscites will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the provisions in the Ireland Act, 1949, which require the consent of the Northern Ireland Parliament to any change in the Border. 13. 
in themselves constitute in the view of Her Majesty’s Government a lasting solution for the problems of Northern Ireland. Means must still be found which will ensure for the whole community an active, permanent and guaranteed role in the life and public affairs of the Province. Our immediate proposals are put forward in the hope that they will so change the climate of political opinion in Northern Ireland that discussions can be resumed in an effort to reach agreement on a new way forward to this end; and it is our intention, as soon as circumstances permit, to promote the necessary consultations about the future structure of Government in Northern Ireland. 14. 
I would like to pay tribute to the strength of conviction with which 
the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland has maintained his point of view throughout all our discussions. 
It is a matter of deepest regret to 
Her Majesty’s Government that we were unable to reach a final agreement. In the last resort, however, responsibility rests with the United Kingdom Government and Parliament; and we should be abdicating that responsibility if in this critical situation we did not take the action which we believed to be right. 
These, Mr. Speaker, are our immediate proposals. But they do not

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland I suggest that when you see the Lobby at noon 
tomorrow you take the opportunity to chart the course of the Government’s thinking in recent months. 2. 
You might speak on the following lines:In the first few months following the 
introduction of internment on 9 August the IRA terrorism was fairly effective. 
By November 
however the Army’s tactics began to have an impact. In January the Government were able to contemplate a situation arising in the spring or early summer when the IRA’s hold over the Catholic minority (except in London-derry) would have been loosened to the point where it might have become possible to hold talks of the kind envisaged by the Home Secretary in his statement of 7 September. Londonderry administered a shock to opinion 
throughout Ireland. This, and the sequel at Newry, created a new situation in which direct intervention by H.M. Government became a possibility. Ministers therefore set to work urgently to 
consider whether this possibility was real and if so how it could best be exploited. 
Early in the 
process which then ensued Ministers came to the conclusion that the effect of Londonderry on public opinin made it not only possible but in fact desirable for the Government to intervene. 
The 
post-Londonderry situation provided an opportunity by direct intervention to break the circle of violence and make a new start.

Bill which will transfer to Westminster, permanently, responsibility for the main functions of law and order. 
The duties and responsibities of the 
Northern Ireland Attorney-General will also be transferred to the Attorney-General for England and Wales. 7. 
As soon as responsibility has been trans- 
ferred an immediate review will be put in hand by this Government of all internment orders with a view to revoking as many of them as possible consistent with public safety. 
The Government have taken 
this decision after consultation with their military advisors. 
Some .... are to be immediately, 
released and in the category of those who should in the near future be released there are some more names. 
The pace of releases will depend on 
the state of public security and the effect upon it e: of the release of particular internees whose cases are under review. 
The more quickly terrorist activity 
by the IRA subsides, the more rapid will be the pace of release; but any increase in IRA activity will delay the process. 8. 
The increased burden which the transfer of 
the responsibility will bring means that it will no longer be possible for the Home Secretary to discharge these duties in addition to his many other responsibilities. 
Northern Ireland will, therefore, be appointed shortly and it is assumed that he will spend a good deal of his time in Northern Ireland. 9.

(iv) 
If the Cabinet decide that Mr. Faulkner’s counter proposals are insufficient, are they prepared to insist on the transfer of the law and order function in the knowledge that,if Mr. Faulkner maintains his refusal to accept this decision,there is no alternative to an immediate move to direct rule! 
(v) 
If direct rule is inevitable the Lord President will wish to advise the Cabinet about the timing of the necessary Parliamentary statement and the enactment of the legislation. The Cabinet should be invited to delegate the decision on the form and content of the Bill to the small group of Ministers who are directly responsible. 
(vi) 
The Cabinet should also realise that until the Bill is law, there will be an awkward interim period in which we may depending on the amount of resistance offered by Mr. Faulkner and/or the extreme Protestants 
- run into 
considerable trouble. The Governor, whom you have seen, will do his best to carry on,even if Mr. Faulkner is unwilling or unable to remain temporarily in office; and the necessary military reinforcements can be deployed pretty quickly. But in certain circumstances it could be a very difficult period.

mitigated by the fact that it is unreasonable to suppose that all the least dangerous internees can be released at once. 
Each case will have to be reviewed and the time 
that that takes may provide the spacing necessary. The machinery might consist of a review by the staff 
of the Northern Ireland Office of individual cases with the object of dividing category C. into those who can be released as part of the initial release and those who cannot.

the releases. The oath or declaration that has hitherto been 
required of internees released on the recommendation of Judge Brown has been objected to on the ground that it implies that the person concerned has been concerned in the past in terrorist activities. 
The oath runs as follows:- 
"I swear by Almighty God that for the remainder of my life I will not join nor assist any illegal organisation nor engage in any violence nor counsel nor encourage others so to do." The requiring of such an oath by internees has a long 
history on both sides of the border; and the RUC Special Branch whose members are most at risk, would be greatly concerned if it were abandoned. modified

It is HMG’s intention to release as soon as possible 
those internees about whom there is a reasonable degree of doubt as to the danger to security that their release would pose. 
Their release will be conditional on an undertaking 
not to take part in or encourage violence or illegal action. It is hoped that upwards of [about] 100 internees can 
be said to be in this category, and it is hoped to release them during the next few weeks. 
The S of S for Northern 
Ireland is establishing immediately a procedure to review each case personally. If the measures which HMG have taken lead, as is hoped 
they will, to a reduction in terrorist activity, it will be possible to consider further releases; but this must of course depend on a clearly established improvement in the security situation. It is HMG’s clear intention to bring internment to an 
end, when respect for the law and a normal situation of order have been restored throughout the Province. However, as long as active terrorism persists and 
bombing and shooting continues, HMG must retain the power to arrest and intern those whom there is good reason to believe are actively involved.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 117 13 
APRIL 1972 
Incidents during the past 24 hours The Province was again comparatively quiet. A woman was 
however killed when a 50 - 100 lb bomb exploded in a stolen van 
parked outside a drapers shop at Ballymoney in the north of County Antrim. An anonymous telephone call had warned of the bomb shortly before midnight. There was however insufficient time to evacuate the area completely before the bomb went off and a woman in a flat above the shop died in the resulting fire. 2. 
There were three other explosions in rural areas. At Kilrea 
a bomb exploded in a car belonging to a RUC constable, wrecking the car but causing no casualties and at Killea (near Londonderry) the Customs caravan was blown up. At Newtownbutler, Co. Fermanagh a telephone exchange was extensively damaged by a 10 lb bomb. 3. 
The bomb located in the dry cleaners in Londonderry on Tuesday 
(Situation Report No. 116 refers) was exploded by Army bomb disposal experts. There were no casualties. 4. 
There were nine shooting incidents in Belfast and troops returned 
fire on three occasions. It is believed that one gunman was hit. In Londonderry terrorists fired at security forces four times. Fire was returned twice and one hit was claimed. There were two shooting incidents in the rural areas when gunmen ambushed troops close to the border near Londonderry. Fire was returned on both occasions. There were no casualties but an Army landrover was hit twice. 5. 
There were three instances of hooligan activity in Belfast all 
involving children. Five baton rounds were fired at children stoning a patrol in Andersonstown and two children were later treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital for minor injuries. Protestant and Catholic children stoned each other in the Shankill Road/Springfield Road

Note of a meeting at 11 a.m. on 11 April 1972 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 1. 
The Army is continuing to adopt a ’lower profile’: patrols in sensitive 
areas are being restricted, and arrests being made only of key terrorists, or in hot pursuit or on the basis of reliable intelligence. But discreet watch is being kept on areas where inter-sectarian clashes are possible. 2. 
posts, as a result of which more serious disturbances have broken out. The Northern Ireland Office is arranging for ways of dealing with this to be considered in Northern Ireland. 3. 
There have been occasions when children leaving school have attacked Army The Army is experiencing no hindrance in its patrolling of Protestant areas. 
Only in the Roman Catholic Creggan and Bogside areas of Londonderry would very large patrols be required if, for example, a simple arrest operation were to be carried out 
Any criticism that these are ’no-go’ areas will be met by 
stressing the hope that the political measures being taken by the Government will so reduce tension that talks may begin and normal conditions return. INTELLIGENCE 4. 
The Director of Intelligence has estimated that while the strength of the 
two wings of the IRA has not altered recently in Northern Ireland as a whole, they have doubled their strength in Londonderry. Aerial reconnaissance has shown a system of trenches and permanent barricades in the Creggan and Bogside areas. 5. 
It now seems possible that in spite of earlier signs to the contrary some 
public sympathy in Roman Catholic areas is drifting back in favour of the Provisional IRA, who are showing signs of regaining the initiative in public relations.

NORTHER I R ELAND: C URRENT SITUATION REP ORT NO l14 10 APRIL 1972 
Incidents in the last 72 hours There was a noticeable increase in terrorist activity through- 
out the Province from the comparative quiet of the previous aster weekend. Over the three days there were 43 shooting incidents, 14 bomb explosions and 14 armed robberies as well as several incidents of minor intersectarian violence. There were five ’wanted’ arrests over the weekend. 2. 
In a shooting incident in Belfast on Friday a Lance Corporal 
Sine. of the King’s Own Scottish Borderers was killed by sniper fire outside the Henry Taggert Memorial Hall in Ballymurphy. He had left the Hall to attempt to break up a fight between two bus conductors. It is not thought however that the bus conductors were connected with the murderer. During exchanges of fire in Londonderry three gunmen are believed to have been hit on Friday and one on Saturday. One gunman is also believed to have been hit by the security forces in a shooting incident in Belfast on Sunday. 3. 
There were five shooting incidents in rural areas over the 
weekend. On Saturday a patrol was fired on by terrorists from across the border near Rosslea; there were no casualties and fire was not returned. A UDR private in uniform was also fired at on the Pomeroy/Dungannon road on Saturday: he was unharmed but there were four hits on the car. On Sunday a military landrover was damaged by a mine near Crossmaglen: wires were seen leading across the border from the mine. There were no military casualties. One shot was fired at a man seen running away from the area of the mine. 4. 
There were nine bomb explosions in Belfast and three in 
Londonderry. None of them were of major proportions. Three men were killed in Belfast on Friday when a bomb exploded while, it is

Northern Ireland Office Note of a meeting at 10 a.m. on 7 April 1. The interdepartmental meetings which have taken place in the Ministry 
of Defence, chaired by Sir James Dunnett, have been discontinued. In future meetings will be held in the Northern Ireland Office chaired by Mr Cairncross. Notes of the meetings will be circulated to those listed in Annex B. A daily report on the security situation in Northern Ireland will continue to be circulated by the Ministry of Defence. INTELLIGENCE 2. 
With the security forces not being active in the Roman Catholic enclaves, 
and adopting in general a ’lower profile’ the Director of Intelligence has reported that less information is being obtained from people arrested. This is to be expected. He has drawn attention to the risk that morale in the RUC Special Branch might deteriorate if the terrorist campaign continues during these developments, but has reported no sign of it doing so yet. The future plans of both the Ulster Vanguard and the IRA (Provisional) continue to be uncertain. SECURITY SITUATION 3. 
Although the number of incidents of terrorism is much the same, attacks 
are being pressed home with less determination. The Army is studying further ways of ’lowering its profile’ and improving its relations with the community. INTERNMENT 4. 
The Secretary of State announced today the release of 47 internees and 
26 detainees, which will enable HMS Maidstone no longer to be used as a place of detention. The present members of the advisory committee on internment have agreed to stay on only until 14 April and possible replacements are being considered.

TO PRIORITY FCO TELNO 1140 OF 30 MARCH INFO UKREP BELFAST, AND DUBLIN AND SAVING TO BIS NEW YORK. NORTHERN IRELAND: US PRESS REACTIONS. TODAY’S NEW YORK TIMES LEADER SPEAKS OF ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENTS FOLLOWING THE SUSPENSION OF STORMONT. EVEN MR CRAIG HAS IMPLORED THE PROTESTANT MAJORITY TO CONFINE ITS REACTION TO BOYCOTTS ETC AND NOT ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE. THE GREATEST LET-DOWN IS MR FAULKNER’S DECISION TO FOLLOW CRAIG IN URGING NON-COOPERATION. ON THE CATHOLIC SIDE THE BIGGEST LET-DOWN WAS THE OPPOSITION FROM THE CIVIL RIGHTS ASSOCIATION. IF ITS LEADERS HAD JOINED THE SDLP IN COOPERATING WITH MR WHITELAW THEY COULD HAVE ISOLATED ANY IRA FACTIONS WISHING TO CONTINUE TERRORISM. NEVERTHELESS, MR HEATH’S BOLD IF BELATED DECISION HAD CLEARLY MADE A STRONG APPEAL TO CATHOLICS AND IF THE IRA CONTINUES ITS TERRORIST TACTICS IT MIGHT LOSE CATHOLIC SUPPORT. 2. NEW YORK TIMES ALSO, HOWEVER, PRINTED AN ARTICLE BY ROY HATTERSLEY DESCRIBED AS OPPOSITION SPOKESMAN FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DATELINED LONDON, WHICH, WHILE AGREEING THAT THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY OF MR HEATH’S INITIATIVE BEING SUCCESSFUL, CONTAINED A VIOLENT ATTACK ON PAST BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND STORMONT POLICIES WHICH WILL PROVIDE EXCELLENT AMMUNITION FOR OUR ENEMIES HERE. THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE GIVES ITS FLAVOUR. BEGINS: STORMONT’S PURPOSE WAS THE PRESERVATION OF A PERMANENT UNIONIST HEGEMONY IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
..... ITS WEAPON WAS FEAR. 
ITS RECORD WAS DISGRACEFUL. THE POLICE WERE AN INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HOUSES AND JOBS WERE ALLOCATED NOT ACCORDING TO NEED OR ABILITY BUT ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT’S RELIGION. 
..... AND 
ALL THAT WAS ALLOWED TO GO ON FOR FIFTY YEARS. FOR THROUGHOUT MODERN HISTORY, BRITAIN’S RELATIONS WITH IRELAND HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED 
BY TWO FATAL ATTITUDES. THE FIRST IS THE CONTEMPT IN WHICH WESTMINSTER HAD HELD THE PROMISE INHERENT IN THE ACT OF UNION OF EQUAL LAWS, EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND EQUAL PROSPECT OF PROSPERITY. THE SECOND IS THE WILLINGNESS OF BRITAIN TO ALLOW IRELAND TO SUFFER AS LONG AS THE SUFFERING IS SILENT. ENDS.

Clearly the Army must remain free to fire on gunmen and bombers and to use CS gas and rubber bullets against hooligans. They must also be permitted to be as tough with Protestant hooligans henceforward as they have been with Catholic hooligans in the past. But what is to be their policy as regards e. g. searching of premises for men on the "wanted list" as known or suspected members of the IRA? Should the "wanted list" be reviewed (like the list of internees) in order to separate active terrorists from those who may have done little more than aid and abet? What should the Army do when they receive information (which may or may not be accurate) that a man on the "wanted list" can be found at a certain address? Should they search the premises, with the risk of provoking fresh antagonism if the search is fruitlessor should they rely on the chance of picking up "wanted" men when they come out into the open and actually commit acts of terrorism? 
5. There are several other questions which it may be convenient to 
deal with tomorrow, if there is time:(i) The arrangements for the immediate appointment of a Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, which the Attorney General is anxious to complete by Thursday evening. 
(ii) The appointment of the Advisory Commissionon which the Lord President should put forward proposals as quickly as possible. 
fully established before the end of the Easter recess. 
(iii) The scope and timing of the first releases of internees, where it might be useful to ask the Lord President if he has yet been able to give any thought to the procedure for initiating a review. Sooner or later the Government will be challenged in Parliament about the criteria governing the rate of release and the selection of individuals; and we ought to decide these as soon as possible. 
(iv) The cratering of Border roads, where the Lord President is inclined to favour some degree of unobtrusive relaxation, particularly if there are grounds for hoping that this might lead to closer co-operation between the RUC and the Gardai. Mr. Lynch’s reply to your message suggests that he might be responsive to a discreet gesture of this kind.

Protestants, their views have mainly been demonstrated by the strike and rallies and there have not beon signs of organised violence by them on any scale. 
MR FAULKNER 4. 
In a statement on 24 March Mr Faulkner said that his Government had been 
unable to accept the British Government’s original proposal for the transfer of responsibility for security to the United Kingdom Parliament because this was "a vital principle". 
On the British Government’s consequential proposals 
Mr Faulkner said that he opposed an advisory commission as "basically undemocratic", and many people, he said, would draw the message from these events that violence paid. 
He asked people to remain calm, and on no account to be led into 
confrontation with the security farces. 5.

Mr Faulkner is reported to have said that Unionists could no longer rely on the United Kingdom Government. Unionists’ strength lay in their power of veto. The parliamentary party and leadership would meet regularly to formulate detailed policies and report to the Unionist Council: no political solution would work without their co-operation. 
The proposed commission, he said, would have no 
credbility or standing. 6. 
At a large rally (reportedly 100,000 people) at Stormont on 29 March called by the Ulster Vanguard Mr Faulkner said that he shared peoplo’s resentment and

Note of a meeting held on 25 April 
SECURITY SITUATION Shooting incidents continue to be many and explosions few. More shooting 
incidents than usual have been unexplained, possibly reflecting the increased tension between the communities which was evidenced by disturbances in Londonderry over the weekend. The barricades put up in the Waterside area then were removed yesterday as a result of peaceful persuasion. INTELLIGENCE 2. 
The Director of Intelligence has reported a deterioration in relations 
between the two communities and increased evidence of Protestant extremists trying to procure arms. 
Although there is still a feeling amongst Roman Catholics 
that the violence should end, practical support continues to be given to the IRA. CIVIL PROCEEDINGS 3. 
The settlement by which damages were awarded to 16 people who have been 
interned has not attracted much unfavourable comment. The claims were based on alleged treatment at Ballykinlar (during the ’exercises’) and Long Kesh (during disturbances there). 4.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 210700 hrs to 240700 hrs APR 72 GENERAL 1. 
The 72 hour period ending at 0700 hrs on Monday 24 April saw the first 
sign in Londonderry of the emergence of a Protestant reaction to the continuing situation in the BOGSIDE and CREGGAN: Protestant barricades were erected in the WATERSIDE area of LONDONDERRY. There were 24 minor instances of intersection activity throughout the province and a higher than usual level of unexplained shooting incidents. During the period there were 104 shooting incidents (in 29 of which Security Forces ore not involved and in 34 of which Scurity Forces returned fire) and 8 bomb explosions. 
2. On Friday21 April there were five explosions throughout the Province 
and a bomb on the border was neutralised with the cooperation of the Gardai. The current high rate of shooting incidents continued with 17 in BELFAST and 14 in LONDONDERRY. There were three Security Forces casualties, one serious; four terrorists are believed hit. On Saturday 22 April the number of shootig incidents was again high - 13 in BELFAST and 14 in LONDONDERRY, but only two explosions. The LAW meeting of 250 Protestants addressed by GlennBARR in LONDONDERRY failed to reach WILLIAM St after the intervention of the RUC, bit followingits dispersion across the FOYLE intersecterian strife flared up in IRISH St. Three barricades were built in the Protestant estate. The Northern Resistance Movement (NRM) rally at LONG KESH addressed by FARRELL, DEVLIN, BOYDE, McMANUS, HUNTER attracted only 120. On Sunday 23 April the two communities in the WATERSIDE of LONDONDERRY were again at loggerheads after a quiet night. The Catholics erected a barricade in IRISH St and stoning of the Security Forces continued with the military trying to keep a low profile. The Official Republican Convention in BELFAST in a DIVIS St building went off without incidents. There were shooting incidents in BELFAST, 19 shooting incidents in BELFAST, 13 in LONDONDERRY, and only 1 explosion overall. Hooligansism was at its normal high weekend level. 4 Security Forces and 3 civilians were wounded. 3 hits are claimed.

5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND WILL CONTINUE TO ADMINISTER NORTHERN IRELAND ON THE LINES LAID DOWN. E WILL AT THE SALE TIME SEEK TO BRING TOGETHER FOR TALKS ALL PARTIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND COMMITTED TO PEACEFUL POLICIES, AND, WITH THEIR ASSISTANCE, STRIVE TO EVOLVE A NEW AND GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM OF ADMINISTRATION. THE PLEBISCITES, TO WHICH YOU REFERRED, ARE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN A BALANCED PACKAGE. THE EXISTENCE OF A SYSTEM OF PLEBISCITES WILL BE A CONTINUEING REAFFIRMATION BY HMG TO THE CATHOLICS OF THE ULTIMATE POSSIBILITY OF UNIFICATION (WHICH REMAINS A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL ASPIRATION, PEACEFULLY EXPRESSED), AND AS SUCH SHOULD BE A POSITIVE INGREDIENT IN THE SOLUTION OF THE PRESENT PROBLEM. IT WILL ON THE OTHER HAND BE A NECESSARY REASSURANCE TO THE PROTESTANTS THAT THE VIEW OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WILL DECIDE. I RECOGNISE THE RISKS OF VIOLENCE WHEN THE PLEBISCITES ARE HELD, BUT I BELIEVE THAT MOST WILL ACCEPT THAT THE BALLOT BOX, WHATEVER ITS IMPERFECTIONS, IS PREFERABLE TO THE BULLET AND THE BOMB. 
INITIATIVE IN THE NORTH, ACTION AGAINST THE IRA IN THE REPUBLIC IS POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. FOR OUR PART WE HAVE ACTED AND WE HAVE TAKEN CONSIDERABLE RISKS IN SO DOING. IF THIS SPRING IS INDEED TO BE A TURNING POINT FOR IRELAND, THE IRA MUST BE HIT HARD, AND HIT NOW. IT IS FAIR TO ASK THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RESPONSE FROM YOU, IN THE FORM OF EFFECTIVE MEASURES AGAINST THE IRA, INCLUDING NOT ONLY ACTION TO PREVENT THEM EXPORTING VIOLENCE TO THE NORTH, BUT ALSO MEASURES TO HINDER LEADING FIGURES FROM VISITING LONDONDERRY, BELFAST AND OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY SEEK TO RALLY THE IRA MILITANTS AND TO FRUSTRATE THE EFFORTS OF THE MAJORITY OF CATHOLICS TO FIND A PEACEFUL WAY FORWARD. I THEREFORE WELCOME THE RECOGNITION IN YOUR SPEECH OF 14 APRIL THAT OUR INITIATIVE IMPOSES ON THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND ’’THE OBLIGATION OF RESPONSE TOUCHING CONSTITUTIONAL, LEGAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MATTERS". 
9. AS WELL AS ANY ACTION YOU CAN TAKE AGAINST THE IRA LEADERSHIP, 
6. YOU HAVE SPOKEN ON PAST OCCASIONS OF AN ECONOMIC COUNCIL FOR IRELAND. TO REVIVE THE IDEA BEFORE PROTESTANT FEARS HAVE CALMED WOULD BE RISKY, BUT I BELIEVE THAT BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH COULD BENEFIT, ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY, FROM THE PROPOSAL. COMMON MEMBERSHIP OF THE EEC WILL OFFER OPPORTUNITIES AND CREATE SITUATIONS IN WHICH SUCH A COUNCIL COULD PLAY A USEFUL ROLE. 
7. THE FOREGOING ARE IDEAS WHICH WE CAN DISCUSS AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME. I BELIEVE THAT A MEETING BETWEEN US IN THE NEAR FUTURE WOULD BE MISINTERPRETED IN PROTESTANT CIRCLES AND WOULD COMPLICATE RATHER THAN EASE MR. WHITELAW’S TASK. WE CAN HOWEVER KEEP IN TOUCH THROUGH THE DIPLOMATIC CHANNEL UNTIL THE RIGHT TIME COMES, AND THERE WILL NO DOUBT BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTACTS BETWEEN YOUR PEOPLE AND MR. WHITELAW AND HIS OFFICIALS. 
8. BUT OUR HOPES WILL CRUMBLE INTO DUST IF THE IRA’S STERILE POLICIES OF VIOLENCE ARE ALLOWED TO CARRY THE DAY. IT IS MY EARNEST HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOW FEEL FREER TO ACT VIGOROUSLY AGAINST THEIR UNITS OPERATING OR SUSTAINED FROM THE REPUBLIC. VIOLENCE CONTINUES AND THERE IS NOTHING YET TO SUGGEST THAT THE IRA WOULD BE FRUSTRATED IF THEY SOUGHT TO INCREASE IT. WE HAVE LONG BEEN URGED TO ADOPT POLICY CHANGES AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT WITHOUT A POLITICAL 
THERE WOULD BE VALUE IN A CLOSER AND OFFICIALLY RECOGNISED WORKING CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE GARDA AND THE SECURITY FORCES ALONG THE BORDER. UNOFFICIAL CONTACTS ARE ALREADY QUITE GOOD IN SOME AREAS BUT THEY ARE NOTABLY LACKING ELSEWHERE. YOU WILL FIND US VERY READY TO RESPOND TO DEVELOPMENTS ON YOUR SIDE OF THE BORDER.

Note of a meeting held on 21 April 
SECURITY SITUATION The numbers of shooting attacks and casualties to the security forces 
continues to be high, but there have been fewer explosions. The incident in Armagh prison was dealt with very effectively. The CGS has asked for an assessment to be made by 2 May of the effects of the Army’s ’lower profile’. INTELLIGENCE 2. 
The amount of informatin being obtained as a result of questioning at 
police holding centres is about one tenth of the amount being obtained before 24 March, and the amount derived from Army patrolling about one third. The state of intelligence in Londonderry is as good as, for example, in the Ardoyne in Belfast. The Provisional IRA is reliably reported to have ordered all trained men with arms to Northern Ireland this weekend, (such reports have been received before). A watch is being kept on a meeting due to be held on 23 April by the Republican Clubs: it is thought Tom McGill may attend. CROSS-BORDER ACTIVITY 3. 
The recent kidnapping and murder of a Corporal of the U.D.R. raised the 
question again of what might be said to the authorities in the Irish Republic about terrorist activity across the border. A possible message to Mr Lynch is still being considered. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office have been in touch with officials of the Irish Republic about this particular incident, but it would be unwise to rely on any new action flowing from their assurances. CREGGAN AND BOGSIDE 4. 
An article by Richard Cox in today’s ’Daily Telegraph’ is unfortunate in its 
assessment of the risks that would be involved in carrying out a military operation to remove the barricades and institute patroing in the reggan and bogside.

If the present 
pattern of events is allowed to continue it could in a very short time destroy the prospects of putting an end to violence. 
You know that my colleagues and I have never advocated a "military victory" policy; we are, however, gravely concerned at the obvious change in the role of the security forces - I need only cite the TV evidence of armed men openly and without hindrance controlling vehicular and pedestrian traffic in Londonderry. 
We would welcome an assurance from yourself that the security forces will continue to seek out and detain dangerous men and that the terrorists will not be permitted to strengthen their grip on entrenched enclaves. 
For that reason I hesitate to criticise

MONDY - 17th APRIL 1972. At their meeting this morning the members of the former 
Northern Ireland Cabinet, who are continuing to meet as a shadow Cabinet, expressed their sympathy with the relatives of the three soldiers killed at the weekend. They considered on a province-wide basis the present security situation and were unanimously of the conviction that the marked escalation in violence, both in the bombing campaign and in outbreaks of rioting, was a matter of the utmost concern. They had received evidence that changed directives, issued to the security forces last week, were enabling the terrorists to promote riot, arson and shootings on a wider scale, especially in areas which had previously been relatively clear of I.R.A. activity for many mont The shadow Cabinet believes that unless firm measures are 
taken Northern Ireland will be back to the perilous position in which terrorists can rebuild the strength of their own organisations and engender riot situations in areas where they have support. 
This would constitute not only a grave threat to 
the lives and property of the Ulster community but would unnecessarily put at risk the lives of other members of the security forces who have fought so gallantly against this menace to society. The shadow Cabinet is concerned that Mr. Heath’s instructions are quite different to his attitude expressed on many occasions about the need for ruthless pursuit of terrorists. The shadow Cabinet has today sought directly from Mr. Heath an explanation of the change in policy.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 119 17 APRIL 1972 
Incidents during the last 72 hours The main feature of the weekend was the very large amount of 
shooting. In all there were over ninety outbreaks of firing, nearly all of them in the two cities (with Belfast having roughly two-thirds, to Londonderry’s one-third). On the other hand, after the many bomb attacks of the previous three days, there were just eight explosions during the weekend and none of them caused any major injuries. 2. 
The most significant shooting incident was that in which 
Joseph McCann, a leading member of the Official IRA, was shot and killed. McCann was spotted at about 3.15 on Saturday afternoon by two Special Branch detectives, on his home ground in the Markets area in central Belfast. As they followed him they encountered a patrol of 1 Para, whose help they enlisted. The detectives then attempted to arrest McCann but he pushed past them and ran off, ignoring warnings to stop. Details of what ensued are still being obtained, but it is certain that he was hit by at least two or three shots from the patrol, and that he died on the way to hospital. No firearm was found on his body. He was by his own admission a leading terrorist and boasted of having killed several people; he was actually wanted for the murder of two soldiers outside the Royal Victoria Hospital last September, though it is not certain that these or other murder charges could have been proved. 3. 
There was a sharp reaction to McCann’s death among the 
Catholics. It mainly took the form of barricade-building and minor rioting in the areas around the Upper Falls Road, but there was also an intensification in the amount of shooting. There had already been 14 outbreaks in Belfast on Friday; on Saturday there were 20

NORTHERN IRELAND The Defence Secretary held a meeting yesterday afternoon 
with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The Chief of the General Staff and the GOC Northern Ireland were also 
present. Security Situation 2. 
Mr. Whitelaw said that the security authorities in 
Northern Ireland, and in particular the Special Branch, were concerned about the effects of the new low profile security posture, and about the diminution of intelligence which was resulting from the reduction in the number of arrests. There were fears that the morale of the Special Branch might suffer, which would have serious consequences since their continued cooperation was essential. On the other hand, he felt that the continued arrest of relatively unimportant people was of limited value and was likely to have adverse political effects. It was necessary to walk a tight rope between getting the necessary intelligence and not alienating moderate Catholic opinion. He added that he believed it was important to keep up a steady release of internees: from the cases he had examined he was not convinced that there had in many instances been strong grounds for internment. 
3. In discussion the point was made that the arrest of even 
minor IRA members helped to build up the intelligence picture and to contribute to the attrition of the IRA; it could also lead to more important arrests. On the other hand, the collection of intelligence must not be allowed to become an end in itself. It was now important to try to separate the moderate Catholics from the IRA and the arrest by night of minor suspects by the Army could frustrate this objective. The aim should be to try to arrest those extremists whom moderate opinion would like to see removed because they stood in the way of conciliation. It might be necessary in future to play down the arrests, to adopt softer methods and to make more use of the police. General Tuzo undertook to brief General Ford on this aspect

118 
Incidents during the past 24 hours Terrorist activity was at a comparatively high level throughout 
the Province with a concerted bombing campaign by the IRA apparently designed to impress on the Catholic population their determination to continue the campaign of violence. There was a total of 24 bomb explosions and a further five bombs were defused by Army disposal experts. 2. 
18 of the bomb explosions were in the rural areas. They 
included a bomb attack on the Council Office at Newry, where a security guard was shot in the legs; an explosion in a derelict house near Crossmaglen in which three soldiers were slightly injured; an attack on electricity pylons near Crossmaglen and an attack on the Cattle Marketing Office at Newtownhamilton. In addition four other bombs were defused by Army bomb disposal experts. 3. 
There were three explosions in Belfast. The Smithfield Bus Station was extensively damaged by a 50 - 100 lb bomb; a car hire 
firm in Grosvenor Road was also seriously damaged by a 100 lb bomb; and a 15 lb bomb caused minor damage to the Beechlawn Hotel, Dunmurry A malicious fire at the University Air Squadron building in Belfast caused four civilian casualties, afourth bomb, in a car in Corporation Street, was dealt with by a trained soldier firing a Carl Gustav anti-tank rocket with an inert warhead at the car under the supervision of a bomb disposal expert: the first operational use of this technique and a considerable success. Only ten per cent of the 50 lb charge exploded, causing very little damage, the other 90 per cent being scattered harmlessly. 4.

Note of a meeting held on 6 June 
INTELLIGENCE The overall level of Republican terrorist activity is much the same. 
There have been reports that the Provisionals are considering some form of temporary cease-fire which they will almost certainly attempt to link with their projected election in the Bogside and Creggan. The Ulster Defence Association appears not to have any great stock of arms, but members have mentioned the possibility of obtaining rifles held by members of the Ulster Defence Regiment. OPERATIONS 2. 
The parades at the week-end were handled satisfactorily. It is possible 
that Protestants will attempt to set up permanent barricades this week-end. The spread of this activity in towns outside Belfast and Londonderry creates difficulties for the security forces. ARREST POLICY 3. 
The arrest of eight men last night, four of whom were on a ’wanted’ list, 
raises the question in what circumstances such arrests should be made. Three of the men are thought to be senior officers of the Belfast Provisionals. The question is which people should be arrested and for what purposes; criminal charges, questioning under the Special Powers Act, or in rare cases detention or internment. The Northern Ireland Office will arrange for the subject to be considered by the Joint Security Committee in Northern Ireland. 4. 
The policy regarding leading notables in the IRA such as John Stephenson 
is that they should be arrested if that is possible without causing disproportionate disorder, even if no evidence of a criminal offence is available. The Northern Ireland ffice is considering further guidance on this problem, in particular dealing with the possibilities of extradition or transfer of persons arrested to the Republic and the attitude to be adopted

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 250800 TO 300800 MAY 72 GENERAL 
1. The Spring Holiday weekend had all the usual ingredients, plus the announcement on Monday evening 29 May of an indefinite case fire by the Official IRA because of "the growing danger of 
sectarian conflict". 
The truce was dismissed by the Provisionals. Another major feature of the weekend was the continued bombing campaign especially in BELFAST, where a significant amount of structural damage was caused. Another IRa bomb went off in transit killing at least six Catholics. Protestant barricading was neither as widespread nor an serious as anticipated, though the LAW/ VANGUARD rally in BELFAST on Saturday had sinister para military features. 
2. During Thu/Fri 25/26 May, it was relatively quiet with twenty shooting incidents, of which nine did not involve the military; and two bomb explosions, one of which caused a minor civilian casualty, the only casualty of the day. Propaganda sheets, encouraging soldiers to desert, were distributed in BELFAST. For the second day running there were no reports of hooligan activity in LONDONDERRY. 
3. During Fri/Sat 26/27 May, there were sixteen shooting incidents with the Security Forces involved in nine of them, opening fire in two. There were seven bomb explosions. Total casualties for the period were three military wounded, two civilians killed, 50 civilians wounded and two unconfirmed terrorist casualties (A car bomb in the FALLS accounted for one of the dead and 42 injured civilians). 
4. During Sat/Sun 27/28 May, there were twenty shooting incidents and six explosions. One of these explosions, in the Catholic Short Strand, Belfast was an IRA bomb in transit and killed at least 6 civilians, e of whom were on the wanted list, and injured another 17. All of them were Catholics. In Londonderry the City Hotel was badly damaged by a bomb. Near FORKILL , in Co Armagh a car bomb was remotely detonated as a 1 DWR patrol passed by. 4 soldiers were injured, 1 of them seriously. A Vanguard rally (2500) in Dungannon passed without incident as did the Law/Vanguard march (4000) in BELFAST. A few token Protestant barricades were erected overnight in the FALLS and EAST BELFAST. 
5. During Sun/Mon 28/29 May, there were thirty six shooting incidents, twenty seven of them in BELFAST and seventeen not involving SF. There were four explosions of which three were in BELFAST. They caused considerable structural damage. One RUC constable was injured; a Catholic man was fatally wounded in Springfield; and three girls and one woman (two Catholic and two Protestant) were injured in two inter sectarian shooting incidents on the ARDOYNE/OLD PARK interface. There were no military casualties. All known Protestant barriers were removed. In LONDONDERRY, there was a peace demonstration (4000) and an IRA demonstration (6000). 6. During Mon/Tue 29/30 May, there were 42 shooting incidents of which 25 occure d in the Ardoyne after a small search operation by 1 RR. Three soldiers were wounded, one very seriously, and five terrorists were claimed hit in the same operation. A Catholic man was found shot dead between Unity Flats (RC) and the Shankill. Londonderry was extremely quiet. There were two cross border shooting incidents. In another shooting incident in Co Down civilian shot two intruders, one of who died later.

MESSAGE NO 2 N0 10 TO CHEQUERS 27 MAY 1972 
PRIME MINISTER FROM CHRISTOPHER ROBERTS CONFIDENTIAL 
IN YOUR MESSAGE NUMBER 12 OF 26 .MAY, YOU SUGGESTED THAT A MESSAGE MIGHT BE SENT TO MR LYNCH ABOUT THE SPECIAL COURTS SET UP IN THE IRISH REPUBLIC. 
I HAVE CONSULTED THE FCO 
AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE ON THIS. THEIR VIEW IS THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT FOR THE AMBASSADOR TO CONVEY A MESSAGE FROM 
H M G AND TO INDICATE THAT IT HAD BEEN SEEN AND APPROVED BY YOURSELF. BUT THAT THEY DO NOT THINK A FORMAL PRIME MINISTER TO PRIME MINISTER MESSAGE IS DESIRABLE AT THIS STAGE STOP 
WE SHOULD NOT TAKE TOO ENTHUSIASTIC A VIEW OF THE SPECIAL COURTS UNTIL WE SEE HOW THEY OPERATE IN PRACTICE. 
DO YOU APPROVE THE DESPATCH TO DUBLIN OF THE FOLLOWING DRAFT TELEGRAM ? 
CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESSED DUBLIN REPEAT UKREP BELFAST ’SPECIAL COURTS. 1. 
UNLESS YOU SEE OBJECTION YOU SHOULD SEEK AN EARLY 
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE FOLLOWING LINES: BEGINS: HMG WARMLY WELCOME THE DECISION TO INTRODUCE 
SPECIAL COURTS. IN HMG’S VIEW IT IS NOW ESSENTIAL TO SUSTAIN THE EFFORTS OF THOSE IN THE NORTH WHO ARE TRYING TO SHIFT THE EMPHASIS FROM MILITARY TO POLITICAL ACTIVITY, AND IN THIS TASK THERE IS CONSIDERABLE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE IF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC MINORITY SEE THE IRISH GOVERNMENT TO BE TAKING DECISIONS SUCH AS THAT JUST ANNOUNCED. 
CONTINUING PRESSURE UPON THE 
MALIGN AND VIOLENT ELEMENTS, BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH, TOGETHER WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MR WH,TELAW’S POLICIES IN THE NORTH, FORM THE BEST RECIPE FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE. 
ENDS. 2. 
THE FOREGOING HAS BEEN SEEN AND APPROVED BY THE PRIME MINISTER, AND YOU SHOULD, IF POSSIBLE , 
SEEK TO CONVEY THE 
MESSAGE TO MR LYNCH PERSONALLY, SAYING AS MUCH. IF MR LYNCH IS NOT AVAILABLE YOU SHOULD NONETHELESS EMPHASISE THE PRIME MINISTER’S PERSONAL INTEREST. 
3. 
BEYOND SAYING THAT WHILE OBVIOUSLY WE WELCOME ACTION ANYWHERE AGAINST IRA TERRORISTS WHO MIGHT OPERATE IN NORTHERN IRELAND, DECISIONS OF THIS SORT ARE ENTIRELY A MATTTER FOR DUBLIN. 
YOU SHOULD ADD THAT WE WILL NOT COMMENT PUBLICLY IF ASKED,

Prime Minister, and you should, if possible, seek to convey the message to Mr Iynch personally, saying as much. 
If Mr Lynch is not available you should 
nonetheless emphasize the Prime Minister’s personal interest. 
3. You should add that we will not comment publicly 
if asked, beyond saying that while obviously we welcome action anywhere against IRA terrorists who might operate in NorthernIreland, decisions of this sort are entirely a matter for Dublin.

Note of a meeting held on 23rd May 
1. Mr. Hetherington (Attorney General’s office or a representative, and Mr. Elliott (Northern Ireland Office) will attend NIOM meetings in future. SECURITY 2. The barricades put up in Belfast last Sunday 21st May were taken down with the co-operation of responsible Protestant leaders. Although those barricades were primarily a publicity measure, Protstants may not be so ready in future to see barricades dismantled. More barricades are to be expected towards the end of this week. 3. The demonstration by Catholic women in Londonderry against the killing of a member of the Royal Irish Regiment, and against IRA terrorism generally, is to be welcomed (as are the "Signatures for Peace" reported in the "Irish News") but its significance should not be over-estimated. 140 members of the Regiment are on leave in Ireland, and one more of them is missing. The possibility of stimulating isolation of the IRA is to be explored. The Provisionals are said to mistrust their chances in any ballot that might be devised. 4. There has been an increase in border incidents, recently, but also an increase in activity by the Gardai. However, the arrests reported in paragraph 6 of NIOM (72) 11 numbered only 3, not 11. PUBLIC RELATIONS 5. The disclosure about soldiers in plain clothes (NIOM (72) 12 para. 7) has been successful. 6. The "Sunday Times" "Insight" team are said to be preparing an article on "no-go" areas. Mr. John Barry is to see the GOC this afternoon. He has also asked to see the Army film of events in Londonderry on 30th January and, subject to Mr. Whitelaw’s concurrence, is to be shown it. The "Sunday Times" leader on 21st May was unusually responsible, but a corresponding trend in "Insight" reporting cannot necessarily be expected.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 190800 TO 220800 MAY General 1. 
Although the Province is now quiet, it was another busy week- 
end, particularly in BELFAST where Protestant attempts to establish ’No Go’ areas were dealt with firmly by the Security Forces on Saturday night/Sunday morning. This action led to some rioting in the SHANKILL ROAD and particularly in EAST BELFAST on Sunday, and more barricade building. An ugly situation appears to have been defused by Protestant laders. In the Republic, the official IRA issued a policy statement, and one DUBLIN store was burnt out and attempts were made to set fire to five others. 
2. During the FRI/SAT (19/20 MAY) period, there were 35 shooting incidents, 11 of which did not involve Security Forces; only one explosion (in a parked car in LONDONDERRY); and three armed robberies throughout the Province. Four soldiers were wounded one of them seriously; one gunman was killed and four other claimed hit; 
eight civilians were injured. An Ulster Vanguard rally 
attended by 1,500 people in COOKSTOWN passed of quietly. Catholic hooligan activity was again high in the BALLYMURPHY and ANDERSONSTOWN areas of BELFAST. 
3.a. During the SAT/SUN (20/21 MAY) period, there were 54 shooting incidents, 10 of which did not involve Security Forces; and two explosions one of them 100lbs in BALLYMACARRET. One soldier of 8 UDR was killed in a rural ambush; One RUC was slightly wounded; and four civilians were injured. Security Forces claimed to have hit one terrorist. A LAW rally in CARRICKFERGUS was attended by 2,000 people. The most significant event was in EAST BELFAST where a Protestant attempt to establish a ’No Go’ area in WILLOWFIELD was defeated in a dawn clearance operation by Security forces, in which one civilian was wounded in fire returned at one or two gunmen. 
3.b. During the SUN/MON (21/22 MAY) period, there were 43 shooting incidents, 12 of which did not involve Security Forces; and only one explosion. One soldier of 1 ROYAL IRISH RANGERS on leave from BAOR was murdered by the Official IRA in LONDONDERRY; two civilians died, one accidentally during a bus hijacking and the other of GSW reciove on 20 May; and four were injured. Security Forces claimed to have hit three terrorists. During an active period of Protestant rioting in EAST BELFAST and the SHANKILL ROAD areas, a total of 36 barriers were built by Protestants to create ’No Go’ areas. All were cleared by about 0300hrs. Captain ARDILL was instrumental in organising their removal in th SHANKILL; and the TARTAN gangs offered their services with a flourish to the Security Forces in clearing those in EST BELFAST. An IRA propaganda exercise took place at a border crossing post near LONDONDERRY..

0800HRS SUN 21 MAY 0800HRS MON 22 MAY 
There were serious disturbances in the SHANKILL and East BELFAST when militant Protestans tried to establish "No Go" areas. 
Throughout the incidents it appears that the IRA only intervened once. In ANDERSONSTOWN there were six shooting incidents, one of which involved Security Forces. -In one of the former incidents at 2230hrs at the junction of STEWARTSTOWN Road and KELLS Avenue, two bursts of auto fire wounded two civilians standing with others in a group. Their wounds were not serious. In BALLYMURPHY there were seven shooting incidents of which three involved Security Forces. 
A hit was claimed when a sentry at CORRY’s WOODYARD opened fire on a gunman. At 1510hrs in DIVISMORE Park shots were fired at a crowd. Two young people were hit: one, a girl, is VSI. The Security Forces were not involved. Hooligan activity was at a low level. In the ARDOYNE there were three shoting incidents at the Security Forces. There were no casualties and no fire was returned. Apart. from those connected with the main rioting in the SHANKILL four other Protestant barricades were built opposite the interface with the north of the Catholic area. In the FALLS there was one shooting incident. A civilian, wounded by gunfire on 20 May, died. In BALLYMACARRET there was one shooting incident. The serious rioting which occurred is covered in Annex B. 
LONDONDERRY 
3. A soldier of 1 R IRISH on leave from BAOR was kidnapped in the CREGGAN Estate and murdered by the Official IRA. There were 24 shooting incidents most of which took place round the BLIGHS LIE post. Between 2130hrs and 2320hrs gunmen opened fire seven times and fire was returned three times. In the same period Security Forces opened fire ten times and two hits were claimed. Fire was opened on the BRANDYWELL location six times and returned twice. There was hooliganism in WILLIAM Street during which acid and petrol bombs were thrown. Three soldiers received acid burns. Baton rounds were used to disperse hooligans stoning the BLIGHS LANE resupply run. 
ORDER AND RURAL AREAS In CARRICKFERGUS,Co ANTRIM barricades were built using hijacked 
buses. They were in position between 1600hrs and 2130hrs. At 1755hrs in the LONDONDERRY enclave 20-25 masked and armed men took over the BUNCRANA customs post having previously warned the Press. The incident which lasted 15 minutes, is seen as a publicity stunt.Shots were fired at on off duty UDR man near NETONBUTLER. The unmanned telephone exchange at DONGHADEE, Co DOWN (ARDS penninsula) was destroyed by fire after a bomb exploded.

4. 1 RRW and 1 KINGS made continued attempts to persuade local leaders in their areas to remove barriers, but this met with limited success and militant elements were determined that they would not be dismantled by force. A clearing operation was planned and check points set up on the four main bridges across the Lagan River to prevent possible reinforcement from East Belfast. However assurance was eventually given by Captain ARDELL of Vanguard that obstacles would be removed voluntarily by midnight and a major confrontation with the Security Forces was therby avoided 
5. All routes were clear by 0028 although some hulks will have to be recovered with military assistance by day. 
East Belfast 
6. At 1745hrs, a burning lorry was placed across the Newtownards Road and intelligence reports forecast a similar patter of events in East Belfast. As expected large crowds began rioting, causing damage to property and hijacking vehicles. By 0940hrs both the Albert Bridge Road and the Newtownards Road were impassable and barricades erected at the following positions: a. Newtownards Rd by Dee St b. Dee St by Mersey St c. Albert Bridge Rd by Skipton Rd d. Newtownards Rd by Albert Bridge Rd e. Lord St by Paxton St f. Templemore Ave by Haig St g. Humber St by Dee St h. 
lbert Bridge by Chamberlain St 
j. Beersbridge Rd by Lord St k. Beersbridge Rd by Templemore Ave 1. Beersbridge Rd by Avoniel Rd 
7. When immediate attempts to secure the cooperation of militant gangs failed, 1 KINGS OWN BORDER with three companies and a company of 2 PARA entered the Protestant area at 2220hrs between the the Newtownard Rd, Beersbridge Road and Castlereagh Street. They made contact with local leaders who agreed that barricades would come down at midnight. 23 Engr Regt manned the interfaces to prevent a sectarian clash with the Catholic Ballymacarett area. All routes were cleared by 0225hrs and in the latter phases of the operation some Tartan gangs came forward to help clear the debris. 
Damage 8. It has not been possible to assess damage to property accurately at night: cars and buses were mostly damaged in the Shankill Road whilst in East Belfast considerably more damage to property was done.

STATEMENT ON THE SECURITY SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND 18TH MAY, 1972 
- MR. WILLIAM WHITELAW With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a 
statement on the security situation in Northern Ireland. At the start I should like to inform the House of the 
result of the further investigations made into the incident at Kelly’s Bar since the statement which my hon. Friend the Minister or of State made to the House on Monday. 
the indications are that the bomb exploded 
prematurely whilst those intending to use it for a bomb attack elsewhere were either inside the bar or were returning to their vehicle from the bar. 
The facts do not suppot the theory that the bomb was 
planted by Protestant extremists. The action taken by the Army to restore order after the 
incident and the subsequent cross-fire between the communities was extremly well carried out by the 1st Battalion Parachute Regiment. This locality has been quiet since the weekend.. The action taken has shown the determination of the Government and the security forces to act firmly and effectively. 
Since that incident there have been further terrorist actions in Belfast andLondonderry which suggest that the IRA

are now desperately trying to provoke a Protestant reaction. The majority of the population of both communities are showing commendable restraint in all the circumstances. It must be said that they would be playing the terrorists’ game if they allowed themselves to be provoked. But so long as they exercise restraint they are entitled to the fullest possible protection by the security forces, and I will see that they get it. 
Equally, the Government and the security forces are 
entitled in their difficult task to the support and the restraint of all responsible people. The initiative taken by the Government a few weeks ago represents, in their view, the only chance of bringing communal strife to an end and affording a sound basis for the twin policy of eradicating terrorism and the promotion of a peaceful settlement. It is understandable that those who disagreed with the initiative should continue to criticise it, but it is neither reasonable nor responsible for the critics to claim that the legacy of years of communal mistrust and division should be put right in a few weeks. Finally I can assure the House and the whole community in Northern Ireland that the Government will be completely resolute in their determination to end terrorism through the use of the ecurity forces, but they will not be panicked or pushed into over-reaction which could well destroythe chances of communal peace.

Note of a meeting held on 16th May 1972 
WEEKEND EVENTS 13TH-14TH MAY Mr Channon said, when answering a Private Notice Question on 15th May, 
that the Secretary of State would make a further statement on Thursday 18th May about the events of last weekend. The Secretary of State has said that he wants everything possible done to ensure that the Army’s account of those events comes to be accepted by all. At present, the press is divided about half and half. 2. 
The Corporal who witnessed the bomb explosion at Kelly’s Bar from an 
observation post is quite definite that the explosion occurred as the two men concerned were coming from Kelly’s Bar towards the car. There is to be a check on the suggestion that he had been warned to keep a lookout for a car answering the description of that involved in the incident. If the suggestion is confirmed it will help his account to prevail. 3. Both Mr Craig and Mr Fitt were aggressively interviewed last night on TV. 
The timing of shots after the explosion does not bear out Mr Fitt’s statement that Protestant militants were prepared for action immediately after the explosion at Kelly’s Bar. Although the disturbances following the explosion have been seen by some as marking a new phase of violence, the reaction to the Sandy Row bomb explosion yesterday was relatively slight. RUC advice had been followed in not taking down immediately barricades erected on Sunday, but all are now down. 4. 
The military lessons of the weekend events are three: that the IRA have 
re-inforced their military capacity; that the social climate in Northern Ireland is one of acute tension; and that the effectiveness, at least temporarily, of strong military intervention hasbeen demonstrated. 5. 
The suggestion is to be pursued that a duty officer should be at 
Stormont Castle at weekends. Although it should always be possible at weekends to contact a member of the Northern Ireland Office at the Culloden

further and that the UDA have decided to react with equal violence - with the 
result that any kind of tolerable existence in Northern Ireland is on the verge of becoming impossible. But we have not yet reached that point; and the general opinion of my meeting was that even the IRA violence of Friday does not really provide us with adequate grounds for moving to the course of action envisaged by the report. 
Equally, the present policy of maximum 
conciliation tempered by a firm but selective response to provocation may no longer suffice. 
If so, however, we should perhaps consider an alternative 
course of all-out military action directed specifically against the IRA. This course, which would grow out of our present policy, would involve putting the Army into the Roman Catholic areas, demolishing the barricades and arresting all the IRA members on whom we could lay hands. 
It would 
require an extra 7 military units; but it would not involve legislation apart, perhaps, from some further Orders in Council under the Special Powers Acts. The essence of this policy would be to deal with the IRA without, if possible, so alienating the Roman Catholic community that further conciliation became impossible and we faced a general Roman Catholic uprising in support of the IRA. But if it failed in the sense of provoking an uncontrollable Protestant counter-rising, we should then be at the point envisaged by the report and should be in a stronger political position to take the final step which it discusses. (Sir William Nield has put forward a proposal - 
attached at flag X 
which is, in a sense, a variant of this course but would imply action against terrorists impartially, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant. 
It has been 
prepared without expert legal advice; but the implications of the suspension of normal law which it envisages are being examined urgently by the Home Office Legal Adviser). If we were to adopt the alternative course sketched above, we ought 
to do so - particularly as regards putting the troops into the Bogside - as far ahead as possible of the 12th August. And in any event Ministers will need to form a view within the next day or two about the basic choice between some degree of intensification of the present policy and the more drastic course outlined in the attached report. This suggests a meeting of GEN 79 very early next week, any Parliamentary action in the meantime, e.g. a debate on Monday, being presumably of a "holding" nature.

Ministers might wish to consider if the security situation in Northern Ireland had deteriorated so far that the Government were on the point of losing control of events. 
2. We have taken as a basic assumption that the Government’s aim remains

would be considered; and in this connexion we have, as requested, specifically discussed the feasibility and implications of a redefinition of the border with the Republic and compulsory transfers of population within Northern Ireland or between the Six Counties and the Republic. 
4. Our report concludes that an operation of the kind that we have 
examined is militarily practicable if Ministers are prepared to accept a number of serious implications whose gravity would depend to some extent on the assumptions made, but which would fall broadly within the following categories:- 
(a) disruption of the life of Northern Ireland; (b) physical destruction of life and property; (c) further alienation of both communities from each other and from the British Government; 
(d) legislation, some of it of a controversial character likely to require a significant allotment of Parliamentary time and possibly the recall of Parliament from Recess; 
(e) temporary redeployment of a portion of BAOR and temporary inability to meet other military contingencies; 
(f) political and public reaction from some quarters in Great Britain to a policy of harsher measures or to a political solution involving cession of territory from the United Kingdom; 
(g) international opinion, with particular reference to the Irish Republic, the United States, our other NATO allies, and the United Nations. 
5. In addition to examining the feasibility of planning for such an 
operation, and presenting Ministers with its implications, we have attempted to assess its prospects of success in achieving its aim. 
We 
consider that, in military terms, an operation of this nature could achieve some, perhaps considerable, local success in bringing terrorism

Introduction 1. 
We were directed to examine one specific course of action that 
Ministers might wish to consider if the security situation in Northern Ireland had deteriorated so far that the Government were on the point of losing control of events. 
Our report describes the military measures 
that could be taken with the object of re-establishing control, and the civil measures needed to support them. 
It also attempts an assessment 
of the social and political consequences of implementing these measures. 2. 
We have taken as a basic assumption that the Government’s aim remains 
the restoration of a stable society in Northern Ireland, which will remain part of the United Kingdom unless and until the majority of the inhabitants of Northern Ireland wish otherwise. 
Unless and until a 
majority of the population of Northern Ireland are convinced that a United Ireland offers a better prospect than membership of the United Kingdom, stability can only be achieved if the minority can be reconciled to remaining for the foreseeable future within the United Kingdom. 
It 
does not seem consistent with this to propose a plan based upon the option of a direct military assault upon the extremist-dominated Roman Catholic areas of the Province with the aim of securing a total military victory over the Irish Republican Army (IRA), coupled with a neutral, if not acquiescent, attitude towards the activities of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Whether or not the UDA actively participated in support of military forces, a policy directed solely against the Roman Catholic areas would be regarded as a surrender to the wishes of the UDA and other Unionist extremists. 
Whatever its prospects of military 
success, it would present the British Army as the invaders of the Roman Catholic enclaves in support of, if not in alliance with, the more extreme Protestant elements; 
and the IRA would have no difficulty in presenting themselves as the defenders of the Roman Catholic population

the IRA campaign of terrorism has developed into an armed insurrection clearly beyond control under the present policy or with the force levels presently available; and that there is increasing intersectarian violence with considerable UDA involvement. 
5. We have assumed that, as a means to the restoration of a stable 
society, the military objectives will be to eliminate intersectarian violence throughout the Province and to remove the weapons and explosives that form the raw material of terrorism. The Army will deploy every soldier in the United Kingdom or Germany who is needed for the execution of the task. 
For the duration of the operation, all leave will be stopped for 
all units concerned, and exercises will be cancelled, but no units outside the United Kingdom and Germany will be moved. 
ment to the Province of the reinforcements needed some 
We are advised that movemajor units 
plus supporting elements) could be completed in eight days using Service resources alone, and that the requisitioning of sea transport (which would require special legislation) would result in only a marginal improvement in the time scale. 
It would be impossible to conceal the reinforcement 
once it had been set in motion, but its purpose need not be made public. We have accordingly considered in Annex A the timing of the declaration of a state of emergency in relation to the timing of the reinforcement. 
6. One possible course assumes that service resources alone are used, 
that no emergency powers to requisition transport are exercised, and that for several days the line is held that the reinforcements in progress are simply a reaction to the worsening security situation. At a time of their choosing, either shortly before or at any date after the completion of the build-up, Ministers would announce that the fabric of society in Northern Ireland had crumbled to a point at which drastic measures must be taken; and that, as a means to make possible a fresh political initiative, massive military reinforcements were being sent to the Province to bring violence under control and to remove its raw material. It would be announced that all gun licences were revoked forthwith; and that all licensed weapons should be held for collection by the security forces, which would take place very shortly. 
It would also be made

of some of whose members would be subject to similar strain, could be reinforced by police from Great Britain is subject to limitations mentioned in Anne B. 
9. As to the conduct of the operation itself, Annex A describes a plan 
for an initial saturation of critical urban areas providing strongholds for extremists or offering particular scope for intersectarian violence; followed by the provision of coverage for other areas. 
An important 
question is whether this should be accompanied by a general search of all premises for arms and explosives, and a ban on movement enforced by the most rigorous means. 
Experience shows, however, that an indiscriminate 
search of premises for arms is hardly ever productive; and that a more effective method of obtaining information about arms would be to arrest and interrogate persons believed to have knowledge of their whereabouts, along with a more selective policy of searching premises for wanted individuals and arms. 
It is hoped that the selection of individuals for 
questioning would now be considerably more accurate than in the internment operation of 9 August 1971; but it must be recognised that only a limited proportion of unlicensed arms (most of which are held by Roman Catholics) would be recovered. 
We have assumed that in general arrests will fall 
into three categories:(a) Persons whom it is intended to detain for up to 5 days for questioning. 
(b) Persons against whom it is intended to prefer criminal charges, including the unauthorised holding of firearms. 
(c) Persons whom it is desired to intern (or detain for more than 5 days for purposes other than interrogation), if it is decided that a policy of internment will not jeopardise the political objectives of the operation. 
10. We are advised that an operation of this character could not be completed within less than one month and could not be sustained for more than three without the greatest difficulty. 
We have considered the practicability of imposing widespread restrictions on movement, wheeled

15. We conclude that an operation on the lines discussed is militarily feasible provided that Ministers accept the implications described below; and that it could be mounted within ten days of a Ministerial decision to launch it, provided that the necessary legislative measures could be introduced in advance of the completion of the build-up and passed through Parliament without delay. 
Implications 
16. We believe that, before adopting this completely new approach, Ministers should be aware of the following implications, all of which are likely to arise to a greater or lesser extent as indicated in the following paragraphs or in the Annexes:(a) the disruption of the life of Northern Ireland for which the security forces will be held responsible; 
(b) the loss of life and damage to property virtually certain to be inflicted by the security forces upon persons not themselves guilty of violence or terrorism; 
(c) the operation will in our opinion harden the polarisation of the two main factions and the alienation, certainly of the Roman Catholic community and probably of the Protestants as well, from the British connexion; 
(d) a need to resort again to internment, possibly on a large scale and certainly with a sectarian imbalance that would be represented as evidence of anti-Catholic bias; 
(e) 
a substantial requirement for legislation, which would need to be passed rapidly but which would contain elements unlikely to command bi-partisan support or to be accepted by Parliament without extensive discussion; 
(f) a need to seek legislation to indemnify Crown servants in respect of actions whose scope it will be impossible to define;

direct confrontations with the Army and intersectarian riots. On the 
other hand the deployment of very large numbers of soldiers, supported by a clear demonstration that the Army was acting with complete impartiality and removing arms from both sides, could in the short term effect very considerable local improvements in the security situation. 
But even so 
the spreading effect of the adverse reactions in both communities to which we have referred above, together with the inevitable loss of momentum in the military operation (which could not be sustained for more than three months) would in our view cause a renewed worsening of the security situation as mutual animosities hardened and as the extremist organisations gained new recruits. 
The Prospect for Negotiations 
24. In such an atmosphere, even with a temporarily improved security situation on the streets, we think it improbable that either community would agree to make concessions to the other through the medium of a conference. The nearest they have come to agreeing to such talks was when there appeared to be some hope that Catholic opinion had helped to persuade the IRA to call off their campaign of violence while Direct Rule had removed Stormont, the symbol of the institutionalised power of the Protestants. 
Neither the Catholic nor the Protestant community at 
present possesses an accepted leadership with negotiable political aims. In the conditions that would be likely to follow the operation discussed above, it is probable that power would pass further to street mobs on both sides, and that even if any formerly prominent Catholics or Protestants could be persuaded to attend a conference they would find themselves quite unable to "deliver" their communities.

An Imposed Solution 
25, Implementing this contingency plan would have demonstrated the reserves of power at the Government’s disposal but would also have exposed the limits of what the government can hope to achieve through force alone. 
Unless the Government were prepared to be completely ruthless 
in the use of force, the chances of imposing a settlement consisting of a new partition together with some compulsory transfers of population would be negligible. 
But even if they were prepared to use whatever 
force might be necessary, there seems, as we indicate more fully in Annex D, no prospect that such a settlement could be permanent. 
The 
initial shock of seeing the Army taking active measures against Protestant extremists would have increased the Protestant community’s uncertainty about the Government’s intentions towards them. 
The further 
partition would have encouraged the fear that more losses were on the way. For their part the Catholics would not accept transfers of population and could be expected to get support from the Republic in resisting any attempt to carry out such transfers by force. 
It would in any case be 
impossible to make permanent a new population structure based on religion alone, if only because of the provision in the Treaty of Rome for free movement. 
Moreover, if it became an object of policy to set 
up what would be in effect an avowedly sectarian "statelet", the position of any Catholics remaining in it, for example in Belfast, would be likely to prove worse than before. 
itself would be likely to create a permanent Catholic armed camp. 
idea of re-partition would be totally unacceptable to the Republic. Apart from this we do not believe that Mr. Lynch would be prepared to co-operate with the general plan under consideration even if he were consulted beforehand or forewarned of a decision to implement it. 
Consolidatinn of population within the city The 
If 
he were merely presented with a fait accompli, he would be almost certain to condemn it immediately. 
If, as seems likely, implementation of the 
plan provoked riots and demonstrations in the North and the arrival of Catholic refugees in the South, it would be virtually impossible for

30. The Government’s policy towards Northern Ireland has been founded on the perhaps necessary assumptions that a middle ground must exist, and that in the right conditions it would be possible to find a compromise that the majority of both communities could live with, and oblige their extremists to accept. 
In our examination we have not attempted to 
modify the basic objective of a stable settlement within Northern Ireland based on these two assumptions. We regard the military plan that we have described as having no more than a slender chance of bringing about (if only through exhaustion) those political conditions that would make a stable settlement possible. 
31. At the same time a decision to impose a settlement could be justified only by the assumption that no possible compromise was likely to emerge. Nor would there be any point in the attempt to impose a settlement unless it was likely to last. 
A new partition would not be stable; and unless 
the Government were to adopt an:objective other than that of a stable settlement, the only settlements that it could consider imposing would be various forms of Protestant supremacy, or a solution on an all Ireland basis. 
would be prepared to use the force necessary to impose any of these. 
32. Our grave doubts whether the adoption of the policy that we have exmined would assist in providing a lasting solution to the problem of achieving a stable society in Northern Ireland reinforce us in the view that the Government’s present policy of reconciliation, tempered with a firm but selective military response to terrorism, has more prospect of long term success than any alternative at present being considered. Every effort should therefore continue to be made to ensure success of the present policy; this may require some military reinforcements, a stricter enforcement of the law, and possibly a greater local intensity of military operations. 
It must be questionable whether any British Government

33. We recognise that our terms of reference imply that the present policy of reconciliation will be judged to have failed, and that a state of virtual civil war will exist. 
we have, as directed, examined in some detail that of military action directed against the extremists of both communities, but for the reasons given in paragraph 2 above have not considered in any depth the possibilities of withdrawal or of military action directed against extremists of one community only. 
Of the courses open in such circumstances In conditions of the kind postulated, 
the final judgment is likely to be one of weighing the lasting bitterness likely to follow a resort to harsher measures against the opprobrium that would attend an abdication of our responsibilities 
- in particular our 
responsibility for trying to prevent what would amount to civil war in a part of the United Kingdom.

9. This operation, if vigorously pursued, ought to 
result in the recovery of at least 80 per cent of the licenced firearms and at least 20-30 per cent of the unlicenced ones. 
10. Steps will also be taken for the recovery of explosives. 
Arrest and Interrogation Policy 
11. As stated above, the only effective searches for arms and explosives are those based on intelligence; and the most effective means of obtaining such intelligence is through interrogation. 
If, therefore, the operation 
is to achieve one of its main objects of withdrawing as much as possible of the weaponry and explosives now in civilian hands, then it is considered essential that the arrest policy should include not only the arrest of those who commit offences while it is in progress 
- possession 
or carriage of arms, obstruction, etc - but also the arrest of persons who come under suspicion or whose previous history and associations make them suitable for interrogation (including Protestant extremists). 
12. If this is accepted, it is proposed to carry out interrogation at two levels. 
Those who are arrested 
and against whom no criminal charge is to be brought will be initially questioned at Police Holding Centres for which purpose it is planned to open four PHCs, including two in Belfast. 
probably about 5 per cent - will be selected for extended interrogation at a separate centre. 
In the process a proportion The 
extended interrogation will be conducted under the approved rules, ie without using the particular methods called in question in the Compton and Parker Reports. All interrogation will be the primary responsibility of the RUC, who may well need to be augmented with additional interrogators. 
It is intended that these 
should be civilians; their provision would be a matter for the civil Departments; unless they could be provided quickly it would be necessary to use some military interrogators in the early stages. 
The Army 
will in any case provide as much as possible of the back-up staff required to process the information obtained. 
The Problem of Continuing Custody 
13. On the most optimistic forecast, the disarming operation will miss over half the illegally held arms as well as perhaps a fifth of the currently licenced weapons; and it must be expected that fresh supplies will continue to enter the Province. 
Thus the 
operation will not of itself guarantee that the terrorists are unable to resume violence as soon as the 
Army’s force level is again reduced. The plan has, of 
course, the separate aim of so jolting the Protestant and Catholic communities that they reject their respective extremists; if this aim were fully realised, the 
Files\\DNV_round1\\PREM 15 1010\\PREM_15_1010_032 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]

the terrorists would be rendered ineffective despite continuing access to arms. 
What has to be decided 
is whether to rely entirely on this indirect means of neutralising them or whether to rely on more direct means. 
those who are taken in for interrogation, or some of them at any rate, are kept in custody 
internment. Without the prospect that at least some 
of those interrogated would be interned, the process of interrogation would be unlikely to succeed. 
14. If it were agreed that the need to keep potential terrorists out of circulation outweighed the political penalties of doing so, the security forces could attempt in the course of the operation to arrest all those reliably believed to be members of the Provisional 
- and 
possibly the Official IRA, depending on their reactions as well as those reliably believed to be organisers of Protestant para-military activity. 
roughly estimated that up to 400 extremists would be arrested on the first day of the operation and some 50 a day during the ensuing two weeks - 
by the end of 
which it is expected that there would be roughly up to 1500 IRA members in custody (ie the 2000 known activists less those who had escaped or had been killed while offering resistance in the early stages) and perhaps 100 Protestants. 
This estimate of up to 1600 does not include the 300-odd at present interned. Special steps 
would obviously have to be taken, in that case, to provide adequate accommodation and staffing for their continuing custody and also the custody of those to be charged with offences. 
It is difficult to see how this could be done 
without removing a large number of convicted prisoners upwards of 1000 - from the prisons and camps in Northern Ireland to prisons in Britain. 
15. A compromise (which would rovide the sanction needed to support interrogation but would have much less effect in keeping terrorists out of circulation) would be to keep in custody a much smaller number (say 300) comprising the most important organisers of subversion and the most dangerous gunmen and bombers. 
Legal Powers for the Security Forces 
16. Most of the powers which the security forces are expected to recuire for the implementation of this plan are already available under the Special Powers Regulations. The additional powers which the Army itself would wish to have are considered in Annex C. 
17. But, however comprehensive the specific powers that 
are available, it will be inherent in the nature of the operation that individual members of the security forces will be faced even more than usual with taking instant decisions on whether and how to act (eg whether to open fire) and it is thought essential, if the security forces are not to be seriously inhibited, that such decisions should be taken without the fear of their legality 
In that case, it is 
On the answer to this question depends whether - detention and

legality being subsequently called in question. It is 
therefore crucial that, whatever and however emergency powers are taken by the Crown, the members of the security forces should be told of the Government’s intention to seek an Act of Indemnity in due course for all actions taken in good faith by Crown servants (including those conducting interrogation) in the course of the operation. 
(In the interests of a vigorous 
information policy during the operation, it is hoped that the indemnity would extend to statements by Government spokesmen which might otherwise amount to defamation - eg statements identifying people as terrorists - as well as to such actions as opening fire.)

approval in the usual way. Maintenance of Essential Services 
19. Contingency plans already exist, and are being further reviewed, to maintain a wide range of public services by the partial use of Service personnel. Most of these plans have of necessity to assume that civilian employees in the senior and middle levels of management would remain at work; and it must be recognised that if this assumption proved unfounded then there would inevitably be some stoppages of essential services. 
20. If such contingency plans were invoked, their prime objective would be the ability of the security forces to remain effective, rather than the convenience of the civil population. 
This would be consistent 
with the philosophy of this plan if it were in operation at the time. 
There would

stoppage. Some United Kingdom civil servants, particularly those based 
in Britain, would be concerned about the possibility of terrorist action against them, or at least social pressure and intimidation. The Civil Service Department are giving further consideration to these points. 
4. Local authority staff and other public service staff (fire, 
ambulances, buses, trains, hospitals, etc.) would be unlikely to withhold their labour. 
Some local authorities themselves might well wish 
to obstruct the Government, but it would be some time, perhaps weeks, before they could produce an effective reaction. 
5. The RUC might be a greater problem. A good deal of resentment 
could be expected, both at the nature of the operation (particularly its anti-UDA element) and at any military eclipse of the police role. 
In 
the atmosphere of siege which the operation would generate, their sympathies would lie with the Protestant community and, although unlikely to be translated into action, might well prompt embarrassing inaction. Any reinforcement of the police from Great Britain would probably add to RUC resentment, while adding comparatively little to the efficiency of the force in short term. 
In any event, it would not be possible to use 
compulsion to provide such reinforcements without revoking the firm assurances given to the Police Federation during the passage of the Police Act 1969 that the power of direction would not be used to effect compulsory reinforcement in the present emergency situation in Northern Ireland. 
It is thought that some reinforcements (though not 
necessarily very substantial numbers) could be obtained on a voluntary basis, although it would be necessary for this purpose that the nature of the role the volunteers would be required to play should be explained to them and their chief constables. So far as intelligence interrogation is concerned, it is unlikely that any substantial number of suitably trained men (e.g. from the Metropolitan Police Special Branch) would be available since the pool of trained men from which volunteers would be drawn is itself a relatively small one. 
Any loss of RUC 
co-operation could probably best be minimised by developing, rather than inhibiting, their role in the operation.

(c) Care would have to be taken not to interfere with food manufac- 
turers and distributors for more than two or three days, to avoid the loss of perishable foods and to allow food shops to be restocked. (d) If restriction of movement lasted as long as a week the absence 
of refuse collection might create a health hazard, especially if the temperature were high; and would at least be unwelcome and offensive. Many families would be in dire financial straits if they were not able to collect wages or social security benefits on the appointed day of the week. (More than one household in three in Northern Ireland is eligible for one or more types of social security payment; the proportion is higher in the more densely populated areas).

four days, some relaxation would be needed if industrial and commercial life was to resume. 
might mean that the restriction could only be effectively maintained at night. 
But this relaxation, on top of that for shopping, If this were unacceptable, a list of industrial priorities would 
be needed, covering essential industries (e.g. coal distribution and the docks), continuous process industries, and those dealing with perishable materials.

Pressure would grow for the resumption of services particularly if, 
as would be almost inevitable, damage had been caused to houses by the security forces in searching and by terrorist action. (g) The transport industry would need to be allowed to function in 
proportion to the other requirements. So long as the curfew in an area were complete, no non-official transport would be required. 
8. Few of these inconveniences would be alleviated by giving general 
warning that movement would be restricted; such a warning would be more likely to cause panic as well as robbing the operation of the element of

However, in the context of an operation designed to startle people

Britain. The administrative burden would be considerable; and HMG would also be in breach of its obligations to the EEC on the free movement of labour. 
9. It is questionable whether a transfer of population even if - which seems very doubtful - it could be effectively 
carried out and permanently secured would bring about the desired result. There is no reason to suppose that transfer of their supporters and some of their homes to the counties would change the IRA’s attitude. They would be more likely to see the moves, especially the transfer of land as a further step towards their ultimate objective. Some of the ease with which terrorism can be conducted in Northern Ireland may be reduced but the threat of terrorism will be far from eliminated. 
10. In the Irish Republic opposition would be vehement 
and universal. Any reversal of the present policy of reconciliation, and the adoption of a policy of demarcation and compulsory ghettos, would emphasise in the crudest terms the present division of Ireland. It would show the utter failure of Mr. Lynch’s policy of trusting the British, and his fall must be considered likely. A successor government would echo the hawkish setiments of most Irishmen, and increased IRA activity from the South would ensue. Appeals to the UN, Strasbourg, etc., seem inevitable. The only possible palliative (and it is not seriously suggested that this has any real chance of bringing about Dublin acquiescence) would be to put the transferred territory into limbo and announce

NOTE by Sir William Nield The purpose of the proposed Order is as follows. First, 
to isolate terrorists of both sides or no side from the rest of aall the communities in the civil population; and to do so by designating them by name or by type of offence committed in a new Order. Second, to overcome for the purposes of a temporary emergency period the legal handicaps which the full processes of the law have been proved to impose upon the security forces and those who will assist them, and which have been used by terrorists and terrorist organisations to sue the security forces and persons assisting them on a technicality for unlawful arrest. The Order thus has political, legal and security consequences designed to enable terrorists and terrorist organisations to be dealt with by processes falling so far as possible within those of the normal law, but with the handicaps of that law removed. It is considered imperative for the success of such an Order in isolating terrorists, that it should be accompanied by a continuation and indeed intensification of the political initiatives towards reconciliation of the Northern Irish communities which the Government is already pursuing; and that the military means adopted to search out terrorists and their equipment should be as selective as possible, and should constantly be justified by public explanation of their selective nature as between the terrorists on the one hand and the rest of the population on the other. For that reason the Order is drafted in terms which would allow it to be used (for a short period of notice) against terrorist organisations of either side. 
It would 
also be important that there should if possible be agreement with the Republic of Ireland for close security co-operation in acting against terrorists based in or likely to seek refuge in the territory of the Republic.

No one can doubt the intensity and sincerity 
of the efforts made by the British Government since direct rule to achieve a reconciliation of the communities of Northern Ireland. Equally, no one can doubt, after the declared 
ferocity of the IRA’s renewed attacks on the civil population, that they will stop at nothing in their efforts to terrorise the Government and the population. In these circumstances H.M.G. has no option but 
to take the most severe measures against the IRA, and particularly those in it directing these atrocities.

A much more balanced, and better tempered meeting than last week. 
Deedes + 110 (including most Ulster Unionists). Deedes began by speaking about his visit. Belfast looks like a city at war. The 
troops must be allowed to hit back when attacked. There is no reason to believe that they are not able to attack points from which they come under fire. Fowler. No help to attack W.W. It may be necessary to take stronger military 
action. W.W. (the conciliator) is the best man to take it. (Cheers). Tilney. We cannot govern Ulster indefinitely. Must deal with I.R.A. in the end. 
Wants plebiscite now, controlled by either European or white Commonwealth arbitrators. Would welcome opportunity to cut Gardian knot. F. Bennett. We must change policy 
- no disloyalty intended. Must not equate 
I.R.A. with U.D.A. Pity to learn from I.R.A. the news that W.W. had met them. Luce. Supports direct rule. Could not expect solution in 4 months. Need for 
tougher military action to go hand in hand with political efforts. Stressed need to maintain friendly relations with Dublin. E. King. Ulster is not really part of U.K. We cannot govern it from Westminster. 
Ulster people must have political expression, and we must restore a political institution there. Englishmen have never settled Irish disputes. Strengthen U.D.R. and a local regular force. J. Page. Cannot go on as we are. Cut off services and social security benefits 
i.e. in N.G.A.s. Walters. Send message of support to W.W. Boscawen. Too soon to say if initiative has failed. I.R.A. is susceptible to a 
tough approach. Take a tougher military line, without going into N.G.A.s. Fidler. Hope Conservatives will not argue in public on Ulster. We do not want 
outside help. Continue as before, with a tougher military approach. Biggs-Davison. Dublin is being tough on I.R.A. (?), and we are being weak. We 
must support Lynch and clamp down militarily, and economically. Adley. Supports W.W. Orr. His forebodings are proved correct. Direct rule has created a vaccuum. No- 
one in Ulster can see his way ahead. There are 2 sides - the law abiding majority (of both religions) - v - the terrorists. Surely U.K. does not have to ponder over which side to take. Restoration of law must precede conciliation. An agreed solution in Ulster is impossible. It must be imposed. The Times letter is not a personal attack on W.W. If he takes a different line, then confidence in him could be restored.

Fraser. Approves of initiative. W.W. must have a chance. Correct to talk to 
I.R.A. ut it could have been done at second-hand. Not yet clear what W.W. is moving to. Opposed to Faulkner’s visit next week, better have W.W. again. We need a Political Ambassador in Dublin. Wilkinson. Wants Faulkner next week. Stewart-Smith. Dangers of successful urban guerilla operation. Trudeau has 
squashed it in Canada. Must restore rule of law. W. Clark. Last week was not in attack on W.W. We must cut all services to 
N.G.A.s. Marten. Must hit I.R.A. in supply lines and bases. Close the frontiers - the 
military had told him last week that it is possible. Gummer. Too early to change the policy. A change now would help Marxist 
terrorists. Spence. Great offence to loyalists in speaking to I.R.A. We are not the 
referee in this situation, we should not behave like one. S. Mills. I.R.A. believe they are winning. Loyalists believe we have no stomach 
to defend them - hence creation of U.D.A. Government has no policy, and the initiative is dead. The plebiscite was the plank of the policy, now we are running away from it. Vital to take a tougher military line, and set out a framework for the future. Churchill. Supports initiative. But N.G.A.s must go. We must be prepared to 
play it long, and to reconcile ourselves to continuing casualties. Crouch. Too early to say initiative has failed. Must play it long, but with 
tougher military actions, which do not go up to the level of disaster. Biffen. If we tolerate a rebellion in Ulster 
- it will come here later. Cannot 
allow ourselves to set military considerations aside, for political decisions. No reason why W.W. should not raise the profile. Provisional I.R.A. is irreconcilable, and it is a waste of time to treat with them. 
Fisher. Supports initiative. Can’t support all-out military action. Initiative 
was not a sell-out to Loyalists. W.W. had much success, in spite of little help from Faulkner. We must continue to seek a settlement. 
Ramsden. What can we all unite on? Best if Ministers could make a reassertion 
of our will to win. Mather. Desperate need of all people in Ulster for our protection. We must 
provide it - then conciliate. We must attack the strongholds. W.W. is in a strong position to attack them. W. Elliott. We must attack the bases. McMaster. This initiative started in 1969. No-one has yet grasped the nettle. 
I.R.A. has shown that they will stop at nothing to unite Ireland. This problem will continue for ever!! 
On this happy note the meeting ended at 7.22 p.m. Michael Jopling 19.7.72

20th JULY 1972 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I will make a 
statement. The House will wish to be aware of developments in the situation in Northern Ireland since my statement last Friday. 
The rate of shooting incidents involving the 
security forces has fallen from the very high figure on Friday 14 July, but I must tell the House that they remain at the level of from 50-70 a day. The majority have occurred in Belfast. The IRA have again used a rocket launcher, but fortunately caused no casualties and litt damage. Six soldiers and a constable of the RUC have been killed. One of the soldiers lost his life while attempting to defuse a bomb. Nineteen soldiers and two constables of the RUC have been wounded. A civilian was shot dead when he tried to apprehend two terrorists planting a bomb; and I know the House has learned with particular sorrow that a baby boy was killed by an explosion in Strabane yesterday. I am sure the House will wish to express their sympathy with the families concerned. 
Several explosions have caused damage to the centre of Londonderry during this period; and a large explosion

caused extensive damage in Portadown. I want to make it 
plain that any offensive operations by the IRA are meeting, and will continue to meet with, the most vigorous response. Reports indicate that about 70 terrorists have been hit by Army fire since I made my statement last Friday; the Provisional IRA themselves asserted on Saturday that they had lost 8 killed and 36 wounded. 
The House will wish to know that I have authorised 
stringent new security measures in both Belfast and Londonderry to protect life and property. These are bound to be irksome to innocent people, but they are necessary if the security forces are to carry out successfully their paramount function to protect the people of all communities and their property. 
Meanwhile, I have thought it right to embark 
on the consultations with the political parties in Northern Ireland which I mentioned to the House on an earlier occasion with a view to a conference on the political future. In addition, I have made it known that I want all political parties and individuals who have views on the future arrangements for the governing of Northern Ireland to send those views to me in writing at Stormont Castle.

Ulster. you do. 
Thank you for your letter of 13 July about I entirely understand why you write as But when we embarked on our present course 
last arch we knew that the going would be difficult. We need to ask ourselves whether there is any real alternative to the present policy of seeking to reconcile the communities in Northern Ireland. However, this policy does not prevent the security forces from acting with complete firmness against terrorism and lawlessness whenever it appears, as is shown by the action the Army have taken in Belfast in recent days. You refer in your letter to the meeting Willie 
Whitelaw had with some leaders of the Provisional I.R.A. 
He took the view, I believe quite rightly, that in these very difficult circumstances any action

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 140700 TO 170700 HRS JULY GENERAL 1. 
The pattern of violence continued at a high level, but shooting incidents/bombings decreased in number from 245/11 on Fri/Sat, through 114/7 on Sat/Sun to 61/3 on Sun/Mon. 
nevertheless casualties were 
heavy and included five soldiers (making 13 in all in the 7 days since the ceasefire ended, the worst week yet), one RUC and one civilian killed. Terrorist casualties included one definately killed and 54 hits claimed by Security Forces. In Belfast, the main areas- of activity were in Ballymurphy and the Ardoyne where shooting was frequent; and in Lenadoon, where the evacuation of some 2000 (NOT 3000) people, if not a propaganda exercise, makes one wonder what measure of moderate opinion still remains in such areas. In Londonderry, a confused situation about barrier building put the Army in a poor light through no apparent fault of its own; and the Provisional leader there has been reported as saying that the bombing programme for the city centre was practically complete but would be continued in other ways, mainly against Army targets. In the Rural Are s, a youth of 18 died on Saturday in Strabane after incidents during which soldiers being stoned replied by firing rubber bullets. But the worst incidents were those at Crossmaglen involving the death of an ATO on Saturday and the mining of a 1DWR pig on Sunday when two soldiers were killed. In the Republic, Mr Lynch’s government had a majority of 4 in the 2 days debate 
on Ulster but faces a critical bye 
election in mid Cork in early August. In Great Britain, weekend press headlines were all dominated by Ulster and concentrated variously on the end of the ceasefire; the refugees; the abandonment of the plans to protect the Londonderry City centre; Lenadoon; and the possible involvement of freed internees in the renewed campaign of violence. Few if any of the papers linked the refugee problem with the annual holidays. The leader writers recognised the gravity of the situation but while acknowledging the dangers of any alteration of the current policy of conciliation in the long term, accepted for the most part that force must be met with equal force and that in the short term the power of the terrorists must be reduced by positive action. 
2. During FRI/SAT 14/15 JUL 72. There were 245 shooting incidents with 
the Security Forces involved in 194. Two soldiers were killed in Belfast, one of them when a pig was pierced. Nine other soldiers were wounded two of them are VSI. 39 hits were claimed and one body of a terrorist was recovered. There were two major explosions in Belfast and three in Londonderry. In the Border/Rural areas there were six explosions and five devices were neutralized. 
3. During SAT/SUN 15/16 JUL 72. There were 114 shooting incidents with 
the Security Forcem involved in 76. Capt YOUNG RAOC, ATO, was killed whilst attempting to dismantle a bomb near Forkill in Co Armagh. One RUC constable was killed and two others were wounded in Belfast. There were no other Security Force casualties and nine hits were claimed. There were no explosions in Belfast,one in Londonderry and six in border/rural areas. In Londonderry a plan to build a road block in William S. and one in Waterloo Place to make it more difficult for bombs to be brought from the Bogside/Cregan was abandoned as a result of a political decision. In Belfast a number of women and children left for the Republic but it is expected that most will return after the holidays. There were demonstrations

Two soldiers were fatally wounded and nine were wounded two of whom are on the VSI list. In the morning the Suffolk area was the focus of the major engagements. In the afternoon this shifted to the Ardoyne and in the evening to Corry’s Woodyard in Ballymurphy. The Falls and New Lodge were relatively quiet. In the Falls a Security Force 4 ton tipper was burnt and a valuable arms find was made. A total of 35 hits were claimed and in addition one terrorist’s body was recovered. One woman was wounded by a stray IRA bullet. 
a. Andersonstown. The Security Forces were involved in 30 of the 42 shooting incidents opening fire five time and returning fire on 11 occasions. Fus CANHAM, 2RRF, was fatally wounded in the stomach when a round pierced his Pig whilst on patrol in Lenadoon Ave. There were four other military casualties, none serious and five hits were claimed. Over 100 baton rounds were fired during the period to diserse crowds of up to 100 rioters. 
b. Ballymurphy. The Security Forces were involved in 89 of the,113 shooting incidents opening fire 11 times and returning fire on 17 occasions. There were no military casualties and eight hits were claimed. A woman was wounded by an IRA stray bullet in West Circular Rd. Most of the firing took place in the evening and throughout the night and was once again generally concentrated in the Corry’s Woodyard area. Over 400 rounds were fired at the Security Forces who returned over 90 rounds. 
c. The Falls. Only five shooting incidents were reported. The Security Forces were only involved once when they attempted to recover a 4 ton tipper lorry which had been abandoned by the driver when he had lost his way and been fired on. The vehicle was found burnt out. A joint RUC/Army search at three houses in Gibson St, and one house in Leeson and Sultans St resulted in the finding of four weapons, 80 rounds of ammunition and explosives equipment. Amongst these were 1x2" HE mortar bomb and a 36 Grenade. Six men were arrested. 
d. The Ardoyne. The Security Forces were involved in 42 of the 49 shooting incidents opening fire 16 times and returning fire on 9 occasions. In the afternoon there were some major engagements and Pte WILLIAMS, IRRW, was fatally wounded when deployed into the street close to an OP. Two other soldiers were very seriously wounded and two others slightly wounded. 20 hits were claimed and the body of one gunman was recovered along with his weapon. Over 450 rounds were fired at troops and over 500 rounds returned. A 50 lb car bomb exploded in Alliance Crescent, 10 minutes warning was given and there were no casualties but 12 houses were badly damaged. 
e. New Lodge. The Security Forces were involved in four of the six shooting incidents returning fire twice, no hits were claimed. There was one military casualty, not serious.

The Army therefore with my authority responded by action to control the areas from which the attacks were launched and to protect themselves and the civil population. It is now clear that the civil population of these areas and the security forces have become the objects of deliberate terrorist attack of a character avowed by the terrorists to be of "the utmost ferocity". 
Her Majesty’s Government’s policy remains to seek to reconcile the differences of the two communities whilst acting with the greatest firmness against lawlessness and terrorism wherever it appears.

10 July 1972 
The Rt Hon Sir Burke Trend GCB CVO Cabinet Office 70 Whitehall London S W 1 
This letter is a postscript to this afternoon’s GEN 79 meeting, and is sent because my Secretary of State is worried on one important point. 
This is that there 
is in the present situation in Northern Ireland a serious risk in under-reacting as well as in overreacting. 
are as follows. 
The IRA consists of a few hundreds of effective members which, with a good deal of money, a fairly secure base in Eire and sympathy of the Catholic population, have enabled them to terrorise Northern Ireland for over 
2½ years. 
In that time the Protestant population’s traditional hostility to the Catholic population and to Eire has been very strongly intensified. 
These groups are now well At working and middle 
class level this has led to the formation first of local vigalante groups, and then to their confederation first in the UVF and then in the UDA (now 25,000 strong and supplied with arms). 
disciplined, centrally co-ordinated, allied with the 100,000 strong Protestant trade union, the Loyalist Association of Workers, and in constant contact with a spectrum of Protestant political organisations from the right of the Unionist Party through the Paisley’s Democratic Unionist Party to Craig’s Vanguard. 
The UDA never believed in the conciliation policy, nor in the cease-fire, and now the cease-fire is over they are demanding action to bring IRA terrorism to an end and to open up and police properly the Catholic "no-go" areas. 
They say they will extend their own "no-go" 
areas until this is done and make no secret of their intention to use this as a means of pressure on the British Government including its Northern Ireland component. 
There is also plenty of evidence to suggest that they also intend to use their undoubted The facts and the logic behind this concern

force to press for a restoration of a Northern Ireland Parliament and perhaps to go for a unilateral declaration of independence by Northern Ireland if they do not get the terms they want from Westminster. 
In short, they 
are challenging the authority of the Government, as they did on Monday night last. 
If a force of this size is not satisfied with HMG’s reaction to the IRA breach of the cease-fire there is no reason to think that they will not put into effect their threats to extend their own "no-go" areas; and they may go in for increasing intimidation of the Catholic population and assassination of those individuals whom they believe to be IRA terrorists. Insofar therefore as HMG appears to 
be continuing to 
try to placate the Catholic minority and also not to be acting with what the UDA regard as satisfactory severity against the IRA terrorists, the UDA may decide to push their luck further and further, to extend their organisation of intimidation and propaganda, to be seen to be defending the Protestant population against the IRA and to decide increasingly to oppose the security forces if the latter seek to defend the Catholic population against intimidation. 
As I see it therefore the Secretary of State’s anxiety is that he is not opposed by one violent and subversive force, the IRA, but by two, the IRA and the UDA. 
And 
moreover, that between these forces, the Army can neither ally with the one or the other, because both are challenging the authority of the Government; nor can they take on both at once with anything like their present strength, quite apart from the considerable sympathy for the UDA which 2 years of bombings has aroused in the Army’s auxiliary security forces, i.e. the Ulster Defence Force and the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

The House may be interested to know what these demanded were: Before I could even discuss these matters with lmy 
CAbinet colleagues the fragile truce was broken as I have already set out.

Now they will have to take the consequences of their action In view of by work in for reconcilitation over these last few months I believe I 
have the right 
on behalf of HMG to appeal for restraint and for the isolation of terrorists who are determined to force their will through violence.

Outlook 
16. The immediate future must revolve round the ability of the UDA leaders to restrain their more militant members from taking measures which can only lead to disaster, and the success of the current Provisional IRA attempts to create confrontations between UDA. and the Security Forces. These, in their turn, may depend on the success of negotiations in Londonderry to get the barricades down and the outcome of the UDA Inner Council meeting tonight when future policy concerning the Security Forces and plans for next weekend ill be finalised. 
17. Increasing lawlessness, and a continuation of the assassinations could raise sectarian tensions to the point where violence could erupt without warning. 
just started, because a number of large factories are closed thus increasing the numbers on the streets. 
18. As in the past years, the IRA are likely to regard their role during the marching season as defensive, in the ordinary meaning of the word. The leadership of both factions is unlikely to break the ceasefire during the next week but uncoordinated acts by individuals or small units are a possibility. 
The situation may be aggravated by the holiday season

PROTESTANT ACTIVITY The striking features of the confrontation with the U.D.A. last night 
were the U.D.A.’s apparent willingness to risk engaging the Army with violence, and its disciplined withdrawal afterwards. Also, its stated aim was to protect Protestant areas, not simply to demand the removal of Roman Catholic "no-go" areas. Some reports suggest that the U.D.A. did not plan the confrontation very much in advance. There is not so far any clear indication of how the U.D.A. intends to take part in patrolling. 2. 
The U.D.A. may have gained in confidence as a result of last night’s 
activity. An increase of intimidation by Protestants is reported, and some Roman Catholic families are reported to be leaving their homes. There is no firm information about the recent murders, but it looks as if extremists on both sides are responsible. It is thought that Spence was taken by his Protestant colleagues. The murders carry with them two risks: that the large number of unsolved murders will be highlighted, and that sectarian tension will increase (especially if a popular figure on either side is a victim). 3. 
There are some reports that further industrial action - not necessarily affecting just the "no-go" areas in Londonderry - is being considered by the 
Loyalist Association of Workers. BARRICADES IN LONDONDERRY 4.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the purpose of the discussion should be to consider the forthcoming White Paper, particularly in relation to what it would say about the formation of an Executive within the Northern Ireland Assembly and about a Council of Ireland; and timing. The events of 7 February, when the Protestant extremists forced widespread strikes, particularly in Belfast which were accompanied by serious outbreaks of violence, had led to a reaction by the moderate Protestants. 
An important development had been the joint approach to 
the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 9 February by the leaders of the Unionist, Independent Unionist, Northern Ireland Labour and Alliance Parties (Mr Faulkner, Mr Paisley, Mr Simpson and Mr O’Neill) who had pledged their support for any measures he might take to suppress violence and maintain order. 
A contributing factor in the outburst of 
7 February had been the arrest of a small group of Protestant extremists. The arrest of a larger number after 7 February, some of whom had been subjected to detention orders and others charged, had not led to trouble. 
Action against extremists would continue. 
These developments had a bearing upon the timing and the content of the White Paper. 
Ireland, Mr Lynch, to hold a General Election on 28 February, which argued against publishing the White Paper before that date; and the importance of settling the constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland, if possible, well in advance of a General Election in the United Kingdom. 
Other factors were the decision of the Prime Minister of This last consideration might argue in favour of a 
clear definition of the constitution in the White Paper, rather than an evolutionary approach which would leave the details to be discussed with the Northern Ireland Assembly when it was created through elections towards the end of this year. 
Strong action against Protestant extremists must be accompanied by continuing action against the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). If Mr Lynch were re-elected he might be prepared to do more against them in the South. 
We needed an assessment of how far and how quickly 
he might be willing to move against them and of how much, in practice, he would be able to do so.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the search for a constitutional settlement which would receive a sufficient measure of acceptance required tactics which combined firmness and patience. It was essential to separate the moderate Protestants from the extremists. The division had been encouraged by the events of the last few days; but if our constitutional proposals went beyond a certain point the Protestant moderates would not accept them, and would be driven to non-co-operation or to extremist positions. proposals would then become unworkable. 
however, the Roman Cathclics would refuse to co-operate; and this would make the proposals unworkable. 
He believed that it should be 
possible to find a point of balance at which, while moderates on each side felt that what we proposed fell short of their reasonable demands, they would agree to co-operate with us. 
Election of the Assembly In discussion it was agreed that an alternative to electior by the single transferable vote might be to adopt the system used for the election of the Bundestag in the Federal Republic of Germany: a proportion of the Assembly would be elected by a system of direct voting, additional members being chosen in order that the final representation by Parties should reflect the total number of votes gained by each Party. Further studies were being made. 
Council of Ireland There had been some preliminary exchanges with officials from Dublin. From the Irish side it had been urged that a Council should from the beginning be given certain powers of decision. 
They appeared to 
envisage a decision-making body consisting of Ministers, a deliberative organ of Parliamentarians, and a permanent secretariat. it was agreed that this formula was too ambitious. 
It was doubtful 
whether the Council could be given executive powers at the very beginning; such an arrangement would not be acceptable to Protestant opinion in the North.

4. Provisional IRA activity has been aimed both to exploit and to foster intercommunal tension. The level and variety of incidents has been consistent with TWOMEY’s intention not to tone down activity in any way. 
5. During the week a battalion adjutant, two company commanders, a company quartermaster, and two company explosives officers of the Provisional IRA were arrested. The Commissioners courts reviewed 18 cases and confirmed 16 for detention. 
REPUBLICANS 
6. It has been reliably reported that ADAMS (who has been the Provisionals’ Brigade Adjutant in BLFAST) is now in DUBLIN as assistant to the Chief of Staff of the Provisional IRA, and that the Tatter is 
It is alleged that was 
given this appointment in order to provide representation from the North among Provisional leaders in the South and also to please the younger element of the Provisionals in BELFAST. 
7. A meeting of Provisional leaders was due to have been held on 3/4 February to discuss further their policy towards the publication of the White Paper. Provisional plans have been reported to include the strengthening of units in Catholic areas for ’protective’ duties, the augmentation of ASUs in border areas and an intensification of the campaign of violence throughout Northern Ireland. We have had no intelligence to confirm whether or not the meeting planned for 3/4 February was held. 
8. It is reliably reported that the Official IRA/Sinn Fein 
have produced a document entitled "Whitelaws White Paper: the IRAs Reply" and that this document is to be released to the press at the end of February. There is no evidence as yet that the Cfficials have decided to adopt a more militant policy. 
PROTESTANTS 
9. There is intelligence that, at the meeting of Protestant militant leaders on 6 February, chaired by 
, to discuss 
their response to the signing of Interim Custody Orders on two UDA/UVF men, it was agreed that serious confrontation between the Protestant para-military groups and the security forces should be avoided. 
and that the rioting had got out of control. 
10. Similarly, there has been evidence of some disenchantment among moderate protestants who had been in favour of peaceful industrial action and meetings and marches to petition the RUC. There are signs of a sharp reaction against the violence which took place and the position of CRAIG, who undoubtedly carries the ultimate responsibility, is believed to have been weakened. The appearances which he is due to make next week may give further indications of this. The public reaction, if any, to the arrests 
were recriminations among these leaders and some of this was aimed at 
After the rioting on 7 February in EAST BELFAST, there on the grounds that there had been serious misjudgement

on 9 February will also show whether the moderate Protestants have moved away from CRAIG’s line. 
11. It is reported that a meeting was held on 1 February at Vanguard Headquarters. Representatives from the VC, UVF, UDA, Orange Volunteers and the Red Hand Commandos (an extreme group of similar characteristics to the UVF) attended. CRAIG had also planned to be there but in the event could not be present. The subject discussed was the need to amalgamate the various organisations under one military council, and to improve communications and coordination. There has been evidence of a further meeting about amalgamation and also intelligence of an operation planned to be undertaken against the security forces by a combined UDA, UVF and VSC unit. 
12. There has been further intelligence that some of the explosive and incendiary attacks in the South have been the work of Protestant extremist groups, and there has also been a report (pre-dating the announcement of the elections in the South) of an intention to carry out more. 
OUTLOOK 
13. The Provisional IRA must be expected to continue their attacks by all means against the Security Forces and to retaliate against extreme Protestant activity. The Official IRA will take maximum propaganda advantage from the current situation and are unlikely to break their ceasefire unless they feel that the threat to the Catholic community is becoming too acute. 
14. It is likely that some Protestant violence, though not on the scale of 7 February will continue as will intimidation. There is also a prospect tha the influence of moderate Protestant opinion will revive.

Mr Simpson echoed Mr Faulkner and added that it was implicit in their press handout that they envisaged tougher measures by the security forces; he personally would be prepared to accept them as long as the troops are shown to be completely impartial. He specifically mentioned regional curfews as a possible new hindrance to the terrorists. Mr Faulkner added that the majority community would not, however, accept additional hardship in new security measures if the Secretary of State was seen to be swayed by outside interests. (He presumably meant the Government of the Irish Republic though he did not specify this.) The Secretary of State said that it was only internal Northern Ireland reasons that affected his security judgement. The security forces would, he said, make every effort to be fair but the delegation should realise that, if hard-pressed in Protestant areas, it was not unreasonable for the troops to feel that they were being stabbed in the back. The Secretary of State further explained the difficulties of any form of curfew. 
The Secretary of State, with a reference to recent arrests of alleged Protestant terrorists, explained that he only resorted to the Detention of Terrorists Order when it seemed unlikely that a specific terrorist could be charged in court; in the case of McKeague, he had been charged with armed robbery. The Secretary of State also pointed out that last week had shown even more success in the fight against the Provisional IRA and there had been a large number of arrests and several gunmen had been killed. 
In answer to a question, the Secretary of State said that the Cabinet had agreed that, if the GOC judged more troops to be necessary, they would be sent. 
Dr Paisley said that he wanted to make it clear that the delegation were not seeing the Secretary of State simply because Protestants had been picked up. However, as Protestants were being "lifted" he thought it best to have large scale once-and-for-all swoops on Protestant extremists rather than a long term policy of erosion. The Secretary of State noted the point but explained there were practical difficulties.

Dr Paisley said he got the impression from some Army officers that they did not have permission to pursue terrorists to the fullest extent. The Secretary of State said that no new directive had been issued which would preclude any pursuit of terrorists. However, he said he would check with the GOC. 
Dr Paisley also wondered why those engaged in intimidation could not be prosecuted for disorderly behaviour. The Secretary of State said he would pursue this with his legal advisers. He also explained that one prosecution had been tried under the Incitement to Hatred Act but had failed. 
In answer to a question from Mr Faulkner, the Secretary of State said that he was satisfied that all possible measures were being taken to search out arms, explosives and terrorists. He accepted that arms finds seemed to be down of late; but explained that in his judgement the Army should in no circumstances revert to random searches. 
Summing up, the Secretary of State said that as the delegation had given him their support for further reasonable security measures against the terrorists he would like to assure them that he would not betray this support and that he would continue to do everything in his power to reduce the level of violence. He said that, if any member of the delegation had any specific points which they thought would help or if they thought the security forces had missed any trick, he would be glad to know. Basically, he was prepared to accept constructive public criticism as long as he got private advice. He agreed with the delegation that their coming had strengthened his hand in the war against the terrorists. 
A press release from the Secretary of State was agreed in response to the delegation’s handout; it is attached at Annex B.

The Leader of the Opposition and Mr. Merlyn Rees came 
to see the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the Prime Minister’s room at the House of Commons on Thursday, 8 February 1973 at 4.10 p.m. 
Mr. Wilson said that he had asked for this meeting 
in order that he and Mr. Rees might be briefed on the current situation in Northern Ireland. They did not think it necessary or desirable from their side that a statement that the meeting had taken place should be put out; but they would not object if the Prime Minister wished to issue a statement that the meeting had taken place at their request. 
The Prime Minister indicated that he saw no 
need for a statement to be made. Mr. Wilson said that the meeting was understood to 
be on Privy Counsellor terms. The Prime Minister invited Mr. Whitelaw to bring 
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Rees up to date on the situation in Northern Ireland. 
The Secretary of State said that in the previous week 
the situation in Northern Ireland had moved into a new phase, with assassinations taking place on a much greater and indiscriminate scale. 
The security forces had built 
up a dossier on Protestant extremists, and he had instructed that, in the event of an occurrence like the recent blowing up of a Catholic bus, the area concerned should be searched and identified extremists lifted. Following this incident, a search had been conducted, and six men had been lifted. 
At that stage the police could pin nothing specific on them; but he had decided to detain

two of them. This had thrown the Protestant extremists as a whole into confusion. On the night of 5 February there had been a meeting of various extremist bodies, including the Red Hand of Ulster, the UVF, the Vanguard Service Corps and the UDA. Neither Mr. Craig nor the Reverend Martin Smith attended the meeting, which decided on the one day strike. On 6 February Mr. Craig came to see Mr. Whitelaw, very worried about the situation. Mr. Whitelaw had said to Mr. Craig that, as a Minister, Mr. Craig had proscribed the UVF; it was now his duty to cool it down. Mr. Craig had promised to do so; and had proceeded to stir the situation up the minute he left the Secretary of State’s room. 
The Secretary of State thought that many of those 
involved in the strike on 7 February had meant to have a peaceful day. 
That was a pious but improbable hope in 
Northern Ireland. He had some reason to believe that the sort of deal in the power stations hinted at by Mr. Rees in Supplementary Questions in the House of Commons earlier in the afternoon had occurred. There had been widespread intimidation. 
The police were understandably more 
apprehensive in dealing with Protestant violence, arising in areas where they themselves lived, than in dealing with violence arising in Catholic areas. Not all parts of the province had been in turmoil. 
and so were other country areas. But the situation had been bad in Bangor, Larne and Portadown. In Belfast the Protestants had rioted and shot at troops. The question 
Londonderry was very quiet,

was now whether the Protestant extremists would be dismayed by the adverse criticism which their action had aroused and withdraw, or whether they would go on to force a confrontation with the security forces. If they did so, the Government and thesecurity forces must face it. If they did not do so, Northern Ireland would have become ungovernable. In the meantime, the Government must and would continue on its course. 
The security forces were trying to apprehend one 
particularly evil Protestant extremist. The Secretary of State thought it unlikely that other extremists would challenge the Government on this; the challenge was more likely to come on the White Paper.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 070700 TO 080700 HRS FEB 73 GENERAL 1. 
There were 110 shooting incidents 78 of which involved SF (Belfast 
99/75, Londonderry 2/1, Border 1/1, Rural 8/1). There were 2 rocket attacks (both ineffective) and 3 explosions (all rural areas). There were 2 SF casualties (one VSI), and 8 civilian casualties (5 dead). The 5 dead are made up of 3 gunmen hit by SF (bodies in hospital), a fireman killed in Sandy Row and a body thought to be that of the Protestant reported as missing (abducted) in yesterdays sitrep. 
2. In Belfast the call by leaders of loyalists for general civil unrest 
received widespread support. In Londonderry, as was anticipated, the strike produced noticeable closures in industry and commerce and in the country the atmosphere was tense particularly in urban areas. In areas outside Belfast the majority of industrial closures was due to power failure rather than to active support for the strike. 
3. Belfast was the scene of most of the days activity. There was 
picqueting of RUC stations by UDA/Tartans and some check points were erected but removed by SF. 
Shooting was widespread particularly in New Lodge 
(following rioting in the afternoon), Ardoyne (at the Louisa St OP), in Sandy Row (where a fireman was killed) and in East Belfast (where 2 
gunmen were hit). Shooting also occurred in the Falls (during the funeral of the IRA killed in New Lodge 3/4 Feb), in the Clonard (where SF claim 2 hits - one body in RVH) and across the interface in the Ardoyne. The major incident of the day was in the area of Willowfield RUC station where a UDA crowd, out of control, ransacked a RC church and the priest’s house. They were dispersed with the firing of 11 PVC rounds (used for the first time and found to be very effective). 
In a border incident at Clady 3 
hits were claimed by SF. BELFAST 4. 
SF were involved in 75 of the 99 shooting.incidents. It was a day of 
general civil unrest resulting from the call by loyalist leaders for reaction to the signing of the first two ICOs on Protestants. Intimidation took place to support this unrest. There were power cuts at various times and most schools, factories and shops were closed for the day. By 1500 hrs the main RUC stations were picqueted by UDA/Tartans. In the main they were peaceful but a group of 1200 outside Willowfield RUC station got out of control and attacked the RC church and the priest’s house next it. The crowd dispersed after 11 PVC baton rounds were fired at them. There was considerable Tartan and UDA activity throughout the day including the erection of check points on roads in Protestant areas throughout Belfast and the burning of shops and houses. A protracted exchange of fire took place between SF and gunmen during the afternoon in the Tmplemore Ave/Beechfield Street and the Ballymacarrett areas of East Belfast. Pte HALL of 1 GREEN HOWARDS received GSW to the back and is VSI.2 hitshare: claimed against gunmen in these incidental(2 bodies recovered). 2. Protestants were arrested in Roseberry Rd for looting.Some of those killed in the shooting in the Now Lodge On the night of 3/4 Feb wore buried. Shots wore fired in the vicinity of one of those funerals in th Falls Rd and one man and a boy received slight GSW. About 80 rounds were fired across the interface in the Ardoyne betwem RC

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND PROFESSOR LAWRENCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ELECTORAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE, HELD AT STORMONT CASTLE ON 6 FEBRUARY 1973. 
I. FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
The Secretary of State felt that the major problem was how power could effectively be shared among the various interest groups in Northern Ireland. Professor Lawrence thought that the viable choices were:- 
(1) A system in which there was a coalition executive comprising members drawn by proportional representation and in which the life of each assembly was for a fixed term. 
He recognised the difficulties of 
forming such a Cabinet when such divergent views had to be accommodated. Moreover, even with proportional representation, there would still be a permanent Protestant majority. 
(2) A reversion to a system in which the majority party formed the executive, but in which there was power sharing in committees. 
Such 
proposal would not adequately deal with the problem, however, because final decisions would still rest with the Cabinet. 
(3) A local government system which would give Northern Ireland comparatively little legislative power. 
A major difficulty here would be that 
Westminster would have to include Northern Ireland legislation in its already over-crowded time-table. 
Professor Lawrence felt that the sole aim of extremist members of both communities was the elimination of the other and that, ironically, the Government might be prolonging the current problem because the extremists knew that the situation would never be allowed to deteriorate to the point where mutual fear forced them to co-operate with each other. 
One possible solution might 
be a constituent assembly elected by proportional representation charged with making recommendations to the Secretary of State for a new system of Government which would be adopted if he found them acceptable. to secure the co-operation of all sides for this proposal. 
State thought that there was merit in this proposal, but only if those so elected were also responsible for making their recommendations work. 
It was imperative, however, The Secretary of 
Professor 
Lawrence’s proposal had the advantage that it would be possible to see what the assembly would be like before being committed to accepting its recommendations.

Annex B to A/BR/30/8/M04 Dated 5 February 1973 
0700 HRS SATURDAY 3 FEBRUARY TO 0700 HRS SUNDAY 4 FEBRUARY 1973 BELFAST 
1. The level of violence was high. There were 54 shooting incidents of which 20 involved SF. Between 2345 hrs and 0300 hrs there was a major gunbattle in the New Lodge (RC). A total of 189 rounds were fired at SF who returned 168 rounds and claimed 7 hits. 6 of the hits are confirmed as dead (bodies in RVH)there were definite traces on 5 of them and an unconfirmed trace on the other. On several occassions ambulances removed terrorist casualties and each time all SF firing ceased. There were no SF casualties. At 2220 hrs in Whiterock Road a hit was claimed when fire was returned. 30 mintes later an ambulance was stopped in Whitefock Road and in it was Michael Campbell (45-RC). There was 1 murder. At 1904 hrs in York Road James Alfred Fusco (RC), an ice cream merchant of Italian extraction, was shot dead in his nremiscs by 2 armed men. There wore 5 attempted assassinations. At 1635 hrs 5 shots were fired at a crowd in Iveagh Street (RC) and Sean Lynch (15-RC) was wounded. At 1810 hrs 20 auto shots were fired from a car in Shiels Street at people in Dairy Street (RC-Beechmount) and 9 RC’s were wounded. At 2326 hrs in Ormeau Road 20 shots were fired from a passing car at Michael Adamson (SI). At 2345 hrs Charles Carson (44-RC) was shot from a passing car at the junction of New Lodge Road and Antrim Road. At 0230 bra at the Ormeau Road/Carolan Road junction Thomas Friar (RC) was shot from a passing car and is VSI. At 2230 hrs shots were fired at a patrol in Springfield Park and in the follow up 2 Protestants (thought to be UDA) armed with pistols, were arrested. In the Old Park a Protestant woman and her daughter were abducted by 3 masked youths, the girl was beaten and questioned about the UDA; they were released 4 hrs later. There was one explosion when a 20 lb bomb extensively damaged the Wellington Park Hotel. Two dangerous bombs were neutralised. In the City Centre a 7 lb bomb in a hijacked petrol tanker containing 4000 gallons of petrol was made safe by the late CATO HQ Northern Ireland and another ATO. 
If the bomb had exploded the damage would have been 
enormous even by Northern Ireland standards. In Colin Park Street 2 x 50 lb ANFO bombs in a car were made safe by TO. Local inhabitants expressed much gratitude. At 1815 hrs there was a meeting in Paulette Ave between various Protestant leaders, an RUC Superintendent and the local Squadron Commander. The meeting was allowed because the Protestants wanted to discuss Tartan hooliganism but as soon as it started they threatened serious rioting if 2 Protestants held in Castlereagh were not released, charged or allowed to see a solicitor 
having failed to got satisfaction, at 2000 
hrs a crowd of 1000, 300 of whom were carrying cudgels, representing various Protestant organisations, marched from Templemore ve to Castlereagh RUC station to demand either the release, or charging or visits by their solicitors of the 2 Protestants held there. They were seen by a Superintendent RUC, and a Sqn Comd of 35 Engr Regt. They agreed to disperse their supporters after being told that their complaints would be passed to higher authority. At no time were any promises made by the Superintendent. The Protestant leaders announced afterwards that they had been promised a meeting with the GOC in the near future. This was untrue. There were no serious incidents. Between 1650 hrs and 1756 hrs there was severe intersectarian rioting in the Ardeyne and 31 baton rounds were fired. In a planned search in Crimea Street (Prct, Shankill) 1 rifle, 1 pistol, 1 airgun and 596 rounds were found. As a result of Robotphone information a pistol and 6 rounds were found and 2 Protestants were arrested. In Old Park Road a van was searched and a pistol and 6 rounds were found. As a result 8 RC’s were arrested including an officer of A Coy 3 Provo. Other arrests included OC, QM and EO of B Coy 1 Provo and a volunteer of A Coy 1 Provo

26th January 1973. Knowing your close personal interest in Northern Ireland, 
I venture to send you, once again, an account of my latest visit. To summarise and save you reading what I have to say, my 
suggestions would be:- 
(1) An urgent need to end the political vacuum at the earliest possible date; 
(2) To solve the very difficult problems created by the RUC. 
(3) To take advantage of Irish willingness to enter into a treaty with us to rid them of the embarrassment of Clauses 2 and 3 of the 1937 Constitution. 
(4) To ensure that the Apostolic Nuncio in Dublin is kept closely informed as to developments. 
I would like to stress how highly Willie Whitelaw and his team are regarded by all moderate opinion I encountered. 
We 
all know that the extremists of both wings are going to howl when the White Paper comes out, but the plunge has got to be taken sooner or later, and the best hope lies in the howls being as nearly equally loud as possible. 
The Prime Minister The Rt. Hon. Edward Heath, MBE, MP 10 Downing Street London, S.W.l.

and in sectarian murders. 
My arrival coincided with a lull both in the bombing This gave rise to a marked mood of 
euphoria - the streets were thronged with shoppers attending the On the other 
hand there has been a marked increase in juvenile street rioting. For this there are two conflicting explanations:- 
(1) The Optimistic. That just as the tide 
of violence rose from rioting to petrol bombs, thence to bombing and shooting, so the ebb must follow a similar sequence, just as a receding tide bares one rock after another; 
and (2) The Pessimistic. That the evidence for 
planned rioting suggests that this is merely an IRA cover for a new wave of terrorist aggression after a period of regrouping. 
sanguine temperament, but more owing to three factors that cannot be quantified. 
I incline to the former view partly owing to a naturally These are:- 
(a) A marked shift,confirmed by the Council of the New Ulster Movement, of public opinion towards moderation probably motivated by war-weariness; 
(b) The manner in which a Court procedure has successfully extracted the venom from internment; 
and (c) The growing realisation that the effect of joint entry into the EEC makes a United Ireland inevitable at the end of the day. 
To expand on this last point, the Northern Irish problem 
has always been one of identity and the balance, since joining the EEC, has shifted significantly from people thinking of themselves as being British to thinking of themselves as being Irish. 
This is 
because Protestant businessmen perceive of the trade advantages that would flow from the lifting of border restrictions, while politicians are beginning to realise that they will be small-fry in a low profile assembly subject to Westminster but would be big fish in an allIreland pool.

THE APOSTOLIC NUNCIO I visited the Apostolic Nuncio at his residence in 
Phoenix Park, since he is accredited clerically to the whole of Ireland and I wanted to be assured that he understood the motives and intentions of HMG in Ulster.

He wished me to stress to HMG that, insofar as "Rome 
rule" exists, it is HIM; but that his "kingdom" is confined to two acres of garden! It is his view that the Irish Government is the most secular administration to which he has ever been accredited. 
He would like to see a United Ireland but implored me to 
ask for more British troops to bring it about! In return I stressed the enormous amount of harm that even one pro-IRA priest could do and suggested they should be brought to heel by their Superiors. He undertook to reflect on this one seriously.

There were 12 shooting incidents of which 3 involved SF. There were no 
casualties or hits. There was an explosion in a derelict house in Theodore St Lower Falls. In Ballymurphy SF found 2 men digging in a garden in Moyard Parade The 2 men and the householder were arrested and a .30 Winchester and 120 x 7.62 rds were recovered. There was no trace on any of the men. In Mayo St in the Shankill a planned search revealed 30 x 7.62 ammunition clips, a safety catch and an empty case;

(extreme Protestant) was present but was not arrested. An anti internment march was held in the Bechmount/Falls area. 300 people attended and they were dispersed by RUC and 2 platoons of 1 GREEN HOWARDS. Arrests included the Finance officer of the Belfast Provisional Brigade Staff and a gunman of 2 Provo. 
LONDONDERRY 2. 
There were no shooting incidents reported. The major incident of the period 
was at 1911 hrs in Harbour Square when the private car of a RUC Sgt exploded. It had been booby trapped with approximately 20-30 lbs of explosive. It blew up just after the Sgt and 3 constables had got into it. Those involved were: 
Sgt DORSETT RUC - Dead (killed instantly) 
Constable WILSON RUC - Dead (lost both legs and died after 2 hours) Constable DAVIS Constable GRAY 
RUC - VSI (injuries to lungs, not expected to live) RUC - SI (injuries to legs) 
At 1715 hrs in the Creggan a crowd of about 200 people gathered outside the main entrance to the SF Camp and started stoning soldiers on duty. They dispersed by 1800 hrs after the CO spoke to them. SF made five arrests during the period but they included no known terrorists. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 3. 
SF were involved in 1 of the 4 shooting incidents reported. At 1045 hrs at 
the Camlough Reservoir (near Newry) about 12 petrol bombs were thrown at the office block of the Hydro Electric Plant. This followed a similar attack during the night 13/14 Jan. There were no casualties and negligble damage in the two attacks. At 1245 hrs on the road south of Pomeroy a RUC landrover was blown up. Reserve Constable SANDFORD was killed but the other occupant of the vehicle was not seriously injured. In Dungiven there was another protest meeting against the arrest of the school teachers. At 2215 hrs 30-40 members of the UDA were seen in the harbour area of Larne putting up posters which read ’UD ULSTER NEEDS YOU - 
JOIN NOW’. In Strabane a man (RC) was shot in the leg, he is thought to be the victim of an IRA ’Kangaroo Court’.

The discussions are to be resumed on 22nd January; and a memorandum outlining our own views is to be given to the Irish Ambassador in advance. 
Ministers? 
(e) The Secretary of State now comes out with a clear recommendation that the number of Northern Ireland seats at Westminster should be increased from 12 to 18 (paragraph 10 of the memorandum and paragraph 10 of the annex). He notes that this has been urged upon him by all the moderates in Northern Ireland as well as by the Party Committee at Westminster; and, although he also recognises that the Opposition may resist it, the arguments for it are certainly very strong. 
But at what stage - before 
publication of the White Paper - should this proposal be broached with the Opposition? 
B. The Timetable 6. 
First there is the question whether the publication of the White Paper 
should come before or after the Border poll. There has not been very much Ministerial discussion about this. 
At the meeting of GEN 79 on 
18th December the Secretary of State said that he proposed at that time to maintain the continuing uncertainty about the date for the White Paper. He now comes down firmly in favour of publishing it two or three weeks after the poll. He does not state his reasons, although it is implicit in the memorandum that there is so much work still to be done on the details of the constitutional settlement that it would be very difficult to publish the White Paper before the poll, say, in the last week of February. The Secretary of State may also believe that there will be less trouble from the Protestant extremists on this basis. The Special Assessment by the Ireland Current Intelligence Group (JIC(A)(72)(SA)(IR) 3 of 10th January) examines this question. The assessment takes the view that the Protestant extremists 
are likely to give trouble over the White Paper whether it is published before or after the poll; that violence may not be long-lived; but that there may be some continuing industrial action and civil disobedience. 
If the White Paper 
comes first, contrary to the wishes of the Unionist Party as well as of the Protestant extremists, the disturbances may well be directed against the poll as well as against the White Paper itself. 
If, on the other hand, publication 
follows the poll, Protestant extremists will be liable to argue that a heavy majority in the poll gives them extra justification for determining the future 
Should not this be first considered by

OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1. 
General. The level of violence in December was similar to that in 
the second half of November although the number of shooting incidents in which the Security Forces were involved fell from a daily average 17 in November to 12 in December. 
Security Forces more than doubled during the month. 
The number of incidents not involving the There were fewer 
explosions (57 as opposed to 82) and the IRA’s threat to escalate violence before Christmas did not materialise. 
over the period 2359 hr 22 December to 2359 hr 25 December they would not undertake offensive operations against the Security Forces. 
The Provisional IRA declared that In the 
event although acts of terrorism continued the number in which Security Forces were attacked was greatly reduced. 
Unsolved murders It was interesting that over 
the Christmas holidays the Civil Rights rallies were very poorly attended. There were 9 further rocket attacks by the IRA using Russian made RPG 7 launchers, but none on the scale of the co-ordinated attacks which took place on 28 November (see November Monthly Report). 
continue to cause concern, but the establishment of an RMP/RUC Task Force has had some success in reducing these killings in East Belfast. 
Security 
Forces successes against the Provisional IRA have been considerable and have weakened their ability to operate as a cohesive organisation. Security Forces have also achieved considerable successes against Protestant extremists who continue to avoid a confrontation with the Security Forces and have concentrated their efforts against isolated members of the Catholic Community. 
In the Republic the authorities have shown signs that they 
intend to clamp down on terrorists with their ’Offences against the State’ Act and the arrest of three prominent IRA men.

He was the Explosives Officer of the 
Belfast Brigade and is thought to have been the acting Brigade Commander at the time of his arrest. 
This event may well be the reason for the 
predicted escalation of violence by the Provisionals before Christmas not materialising. 
in December four were in Belfast and resulted in two serious and 10 minor casualties. 
Of the nine rocket attacks throughout the Province Unsolved murders have continued throughout the city. 
Until 6 December, when the RMP/RUC Task Force was formed and deployed in East Belfast, the rate of murders in that part of the city was disturbingly high. 
becoming more active and have been responsible for an increasing number of hi-jackings and thefts. 
Protestant extremist and criminal elements are Security Forces have been increasingly 
successful against Protestant extremists and have made a number of good arrests and recovered considerable quantities of arms including, on 29 December, 5 SLRs which had been stolen from the UDR. 
b. In Londonderry it has been a quiet month once again. the level of shooting has remained similar. As usual the 
main problem has been the hooliganism in the Creggan by youths who have stoned troops. 
There have been fewer explosions than in November but The most disturbing event 
of the month was the murder of Pte Hamilton, 5 UDR, at his civilian job in the enclave followed by a reprisal raid on a predominantly Catholic bar in the Waterside in which five people were killed and four wounded. The Adjutant of the Londonderry Provisional IRA Brigade was arrested on 15 December and on 29 December James McDaid, OC Shantallow Provisionals was shot dead by Security Forces. 
c. remains relatively high. 
On the Border and in the Countryside the level of terrorist activity On the border, although shootings and 
explosions remain about the same, the total number of incidents has reduced slightly after the November peak: this is almost certainly attributable to the increased activity of the Gardai and Irish Army on the Eire side of the border and the increased liklihood of arrest in the Republic (see below). 
The main areas of ASU activity continue to 
be the Londonderry enclave, Clady/Strabane and Crossmaglen/Forkill. Hooliganism in Strabane reduced when 1 RWF shot two armed men, killing one, in an ambush just outside Strabane on 27 December. the town has been quiet. 
Since then four were on the border but none caused any casualties. 
Of the five rocket attacks outside Belfast In the 
countryside there has been an increase in bombing and murder, the main troublespots being Lurgan, Portadown and Armagh. 
In Killeter, normally 
a quiet village in Co Tyrone, on 6 December a UDR soldier was shot dead in front of his family and on 14 December a Catholic pub was blown up killing one person and injuring 6, almost certainly as a Protestant reprisal. 
Security Forces On 17 December 
This reflects the reduced ability of the Provisional The IRA have been active in 
Security Forces have arrested several Provisional IRA officers 
and also made arrests in connection with the murders of the UDR soldier at Killeter on 5 December, and Mr. Johnson, a member of the Northern Ireland Police Authority who was shot dead on 18 December.

d. In the Republic the ’Offences against the State’ Act, making it 
easier to secure convictions against members of illegal organisations and terrorists, became law on 3 December. 
John Stephenson’s ’fast 
until death’ lost its credibility when he accepted tea and soup, and he lost much sympathy from his Republican supporters. 
All were charged under the ’Offences against the State’ Act. These and other arrests and the 
more effective action against terrorists by Irish Security Forces have helped to restrict IRA activity in what was formerly a safe haven. On 28 December three explosions occurred in the Republic close to the Co Fermanagh border (Belturbet, when two youths were killed and nine people injured, Clones and near Pettigoe). extreme Protestants were responsible. 
It is almost certain that 4. Political Activity as it effects the Security Situation. the Border Poll would take place on the 8th March 1973. Although 
officials have not been idle there have been few developments of note which effect the security situation. 
During the month it was announced that However, the 
contents of the White Paper have not been finalised nor has the publication date been decided; it is likely to be three weeks before or three weeks after the Border Poll. 
The need for reinforcements for both occurrences 
is still under study. OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK 5. 
On 29 December 
Rory Brady, the President of the Provisional Sinn Fein, was arrested and on 30 December Martin McGuinness, lately OC Londonderry Provisionals and his chief lieutenant were arrested. 
The month of December has seen very considerable Security Forces successes against both the Provisional IRA and Protestant extremists. 
There 
would appear to be no reason why these successes should not continue, the increasing Government activity in the South and the possibility of increased co-operation with the Security Forces of the Republic should help in border areas in particular. 
The Official IRA are likely to maintain, publicly at 
least, their ceasefire and to try and continue to make political progress. The greatest danger to security in the coming weeks would seem to be the increasing tension brought about by the apparently motiveless murders of both Protestants and Roman Catholics, which only increase the atmosphere of mistrust in which the constitutional proposals will have to be introduced. A summary of the achievements of the Security Forces in the five months since Operation Motorman are at Appendix 1.

SUMMARY OF SECURITY FORCES ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE OPERATION MOTORMAN 31 JULY - 31 DECEMBER 1972 
1. Despite the withdrawal of nine IS battalions since the implementation of 
Operation MOTORMAN, Phase 3 of the operation, the build up of intelligence and the removal of key terrorists, continues. Though neutralisation of the IRA has not been completely achieved, vigorous and successful actions by the Security Forces have seriously reduced the IRA’s morale and made the most encouraging inroads into their command structure. Simultaneously, with the development of Protestant militancy and a more general polarisation of the communities, SF have had to look to both directions and a good deal of military effort has been devoted to counteracting extreme Protestant groups. Some measure of the endeavour is reflected in the following statistics which cover the period since Operation MOTORMAN was launched (31 July) to the end of 1972:

Royal Engineers. Army Aviation. 
Of the 18 major units in the infantry 
role 4 are resident in Northern Ireland, 7 are from Great Britain and 7 from BAOR. 
The number of squadrons remains at 6. 
The number of squadrons remains at 4. The number of squadrons is now 4. 
ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT 5. 
The strength of the UDR as at 31 December 1972 was 8,959. This represents 
a decrease of 197 on the previous month. This decrease is as a result of less applications( and the new policy to weed out those members who have a poor attendance record. 
DETENTION 6. 
a. By 29 December the Commissioners had reviewed the cases of 167 men who had 
been interned and ordered the release of 63. The following remain interned/ detained as at 31 December 1972: 
10 interned under the previous powers whose cases have not yet 
been reviewed by the Commissioners. b. 
teen reviewed by the Commissioners. c. 
d. 106 detained under the previous powers whose cases have not yet 104 who were previously interned and whose cases have been 
reviewed by the Commissioners who have ordered that they should be detained. 
72 detained since the introduction of the Commission and held under interim custody orders until their cases are heard by the Commissioners. 
It should be noted that since the introduction of the "Detention of Terrorists" (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 on 7 November 1972 there have been 265 arrests with a view to possible detention. Apart from the 72 who have had interim custody orders served on them, a further 17 have had criminal charges brought against them. 
CEASEFIRE POLICY 7. 
It is possible that the Provisional IRA, as part of their plan to gain 
political respectability, will try to reach a negotiated truce. Mr Whitelaw has said that he will not negotiate with the Provisionals again as their behaviour towards the ceasefire of June/July 1972 has-demonstrated that they are completely untrustworthy. Therefore the Secretaries of State for Defence and Northern Ireland have agreed that in future, should the Provisionals express a wish for a ceasefire, they should be advised to cease firing. The Security Forces would continue to take action against those who break the law or who engage in terrorist activities. In fact for the Army it would be "business as usual" at least until there were real signs of the intention of a ceasefire being translated into fact. Should this good faith be exhibited then clearly political and military activity would be reconsidered.

PROPAGANDA 8. 
With the continuing numbers of unexplained murders IRA propaganda and 
Catholics generally have been quick to refer to these as sectarian murders and attribute them to Protestant extremists and in some cases Army Assassination Squads. While it is true that about twice as many Catholics as Protestants have been murdered this year it is not true that all those are the work of the UVF/UDA, some are almost certainly IRA punishments and others straight criminal activity. We therefore do not favour the expression "sectarian" murders. Nor do we want to encourage the propaganda deduction that "the Security Forces do not protect you, the Catholics, from the murdering Protestants and therefore we, the IRA (Provisional or Official), will defend you and you must support us". Immediate steps have been taken operationally to counter this spate of murders the most notable of which was the formation of a joint RUC/RMP Task Force initially operating in East Belfast. 50 RMP with an equal number of RUC have been specially charged with investigating these murders and with preventing further cases. The force is assisted by an extension of the anonymous telephone-in facility (robotphone). 
9. From the Army’s point of view the most serious propaganda attacks have been 
charges that Army morale is sagging. The basis for this assessment is the publicity given to discharge by purchase rates in 2 PARA and the conviction by court martial of 4 soldiers of 3 RRF for drug offences. Guidance on these two subjects has been issued, but. briefly,the number of discharge by purchase applications in 2 PRA is not considered exceptional in view of the freeze during their tour in Northern Ireland; and a total of 90 convictions of soldiers by court martial and 16 in civil courts for drug offences in 1972 is not high considering the seriousness with which even minor infringements are viewed. The majority of cases involve cannabis. Of course frequent service in Northern Ireland has an effect on soldiers, but there is no evidence that this has resulted in a loss of morale nor that is has affected operational efficiency. 
LEGAL PROCEDURES 
10. Lord Diplock has presented the report of his Commission on legal procedures to deal with terrorist activities and the Government has announced its intention to implement his recommendations. Legislation is therefore being prepared and this may include those emergency powers which will still be required if the Government decides to repeal the Special Powers Act. The Commission recognised that there was a continuing need for detention by the executive, but they proposed, amongst other things, various changes in court procedures which will be of considerable assistance to the Security Forces. The most significant of these are the trial of terrorist offences by a judge sitting alone, restrictions on the granting of bail and the admissibility of confessions and certain written statements. 
DIRECTIVES 
11. CGS issued his Directive to the GOC in the form outlined in the Monthly Report for November. As a result CLF issued a revised Directive for future operations to cover the period until the publication of the White Paper. He gave as his mission: 
"In closest co-operation with the RUC, the Army in Northern Ireland is progressively to diminish the ability of extremist organisations and their followers to influence political events or to terrorise any section of the population." 
CLF gave the three brigades the following tasks in order of priority: a. 
their campaign. b. 
To continue the attrition of the IRA’s will and capacity to continue 
To protect and be seen to protect sections of the community who are, or who believe themselves to be, threatened.

Annex E to A/BR/30/3/1/MO4 Dated January 1973 
TRAINING COUNTER BOOBY TRAP TRAINING 1. 
Booby traps are becoming more frequent, especially in unoccupied buildings: 
the greatest care needs to be taken by all units to ensure that all ranks are "booby trap conscious". The probable reasons for this increased use of booby traps are: 
a. b. 2. 3. 4. The terrorists, faced with a general shortage of explosives due 
to SF activities, are now trying to make better use of their available resources. 
The waning support of the civilian population tends to make the terrorist go for a SF booby trap policy. 
The recent tragic death of a staff sergeant caused by a booby trapped 
rocket motor exploding, again re-emphasises the need for an acute sense of awareness of possible booby traps. 
Formal orders must be given frequently warning all ranks not to touch 
suspicious objects under any circumstances. Failure to comply with this order has led to a number of tragedies recently. 
To give more help to units training for operations in Northern Ireland, 
an ATO is to be attached to each NITAT. This officer will be in constant liaison with CATO HQ Northern Ireland to ensure that the latest lessons and terrorist techniques can be rapidly passed to units. 
5. Farther details of terrorist bomb activities during December 1972 are 
given at Appendix 1. NEGLIGENT DISCHARGES 6. 
There were 23 negligent discharges in December 1972. In one of these 
accidents a civilian was killed. A summary of the negligent discharges for November and December 1972, together with a summary of all negligent discharges since June 1972 is at Appendix 2. A welcome reduction from the very high totals of July, August and September is showh,but it must be remembered that there has been a significant reduction in force levels since those months. Clearly every effort must be made to reduce further these incidents, which not only result in casualties, but also give rise to more enmity against the Army. 
No 4 T SNIPER RIFLE 7. 
With the return into service of this weapon, the revised alternative 
unloading drill has been forgotten by many. The sear and magazine catch of this weapon share the same spring, thus if the spring is weak and the magazine catch if fully released, as it will be if the magazine is removed, there is a chance that the sear will drop and the round in the breach be fired. The User Handbook for the Rifles, 7.62 mm, L42A1 and L39A1 and Telescopes, Straight, Sighting L1A1 and Scout Regiment (Army Code No 60704) details the correct methods of unloading at Paragraph 23. The essential point is that the breach should always be fully open before the magazine is removed. 
TAMPERING WITH BATON ROUNDS 8. 
Instances are ocurring of tampering with Baton Rounds for training 
purposes, by removing the projectile or by removing part of the propellant charge, to allow realistic training with a live enemy. It is stressed that this should not on any account be allowed for the following reasons:

Jan 73 
TERRORIST BOMB TECHNIQUES 1. 
Use of Dustbins. Captured terrorist literature describes the 
dustbin as being a good airtight container for Nitrobenzine mixes. 2. 
Anonymous Telephone Calls. Cases continue to occur of terrorists 
using anonymous telephone calls to lure troops into areas which are booby trapped. 
The utmost caution must continue to be exercised in any 
operation following up such calls and all ranks must be alert to the dangers of any information passed to them anonymously. 
3. Hiding Places for Explosives. Cars continue to be found with 
traces of explosives in their door panels; cases have been known where about 100 pounds of explosives have been concealed in door panels. 
innocent drivers have been intimidated into carrying explosives in this manner. 
There is also evidence that female terrorists have been 
instructed to use hair lacquer or other strong smelling perfumes in order to conceal the smell of Nitrobenzine. 
4. Double Bombs. 
happened in Belfast where a parcel bomb was followed by a car bomb 20 minutes later in the same area. 
These have so far been rare, but a case has recently Fortunately the Security Forces were 
suspicious and no casualties were suffered but all units are warned now to expect this hazard in the future. 
5. Car Bombs. These continue to be a main feature in the terrorist’s bombing programme and they have been used throughout the Province. Many 
car bombs have been neutralised by our EOD teams but it would help them if units could pass back reports on suspicious cars more rapidly.

The Secretary of State said that although consultations over the political future were vital it was important to deal with the current security situation. He was gravely disturbed by a recent development which could inhibit successes against the Provisional IRA - successes which were now very considerable. The results of the recent spate of sectarian murders were that support for the IRA would be encouraged in some areas and there would be renewed demands for more troops to be diverted from hard Roman Catholic areas to other areas, with a consequent risk of a resurgence of IRA activities. It was wrongly alleged that all these murders were the work of Protestant extremists; but he believed that some of them were and it was his feeling that the attack the previous night at the Rolls Royce factory had been the work of Protestants. The security forces would do their best to track down the perpetrators of such crimes but they frequently encountered a wall of silence, although changes had been made in recent months in the arrangements in respect of intelligence and information. The Orange Lodge said that in the view of the majority of their members - and they believed in the view of the majority of the loyalist community 
- the White Paper would be irrelevant as long 
as the security situation stayed as it was. They accepted that a good deal of the recent murders were the work of Protestants. But this was not so in every case and furthermore they had warned three years previously that, if the security situation were to drift, murders on this scale would be a natural consequence. As far as the Rolls Royce attack was concerned, it should be realised that whereas the Communist cell in West Belfast was pro-Republican, the Communist cell in East Belfast was pro-Protestant. The Secretary of State said that he would take note of this point. He believed it was important to distinguish between those who organised and those who carried out acts of violence. Furthermore, he had never equated the UDA with the IRA in the level of viciousness of their activities. He believed that many members of the UDA would shrink from the kind of murders which were now being committed. The Oran Lodge believed that the security forces could not be impartial when confronted with nominal Roman Catholics who were members of the Official and Provisional IRA although there was a case fcr saying that Protestants should have been taken when internment was

introduced. But there was a duality of attitudes, as had been shown by the involvement of the paratroopers in the Shankill tragedy where it was widely believed that the Army had attempted to cause tension. But they believed there was benefit for the British Army in being faced with situations such as this. It brought home to people the fear of the ordinary Protestant community. These fears were never represented or understood by political correspondents at Westminster, who tended to portray a situation of two warring tribes. As far as intelligence and information were concerned, it was important to get people’s confidence. This was not being done because in the rural areas there was not sufficient contact between the security forces and the people nor was there sufficient liaison between the intelligence services of the Army and the Police. The RUC Reserve were not properly organised and used - one of the difficulties being that they were only armed with pistols. The Secretary of State said he believed that the recent incident in the Shankill Road had been an ambush deliberately set up to provoke the paratroops. This had been done deliberately by misguided people whose names were known to him. The Government did not want to provoke anybody. They would not threaten anybody and it was counter-productive to attempt to threaten either the British Government or the British Parliament, who would only become more intransigent if threatened. He was well aware of all the points being made in respect of intelligence and information. 
DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE SECURITY FORCES 
The Orange Lodge expressed the view that for the previous three years the security policy in Northern Ireland had been organised and directed from a higher level with political views in mind. What was needed was clear political action spelling out the lesson to terrorists. It should be made clear that political terrorism would never produce concessions. The political vacuum should be removed. People would not come forward and join the security forces as long as they believed that there was a basic plan that Northern Ireland should gradually drift into a Republic. Ordinary people were placed between loyalty to organisations such as the UDR, which might be participants in their surrender, and loyalty to Ulster as they understood it. The White Paper would indicate

that the British Government were neutral on the subject of union. There were fears amongst the RUC that they would be devalued and demoralised in the way that the RIC had been. Police morale was weakened by the increasing presence of Military Police. It was important that ordinary people should be involved in the campaign against terrorists. This had been the great value of the ’B’ Specials, who provided local intelligence. With the destruction of the ’B’ Specials, and their replacement by the ineffective UDR, this valuable intelligence had been lost. The RUC Reserve should be enlarged and given more to do. They should be armed if necessary. In the Police generally a different officer approach should be used; there was not the same IQ testing to find "officer types" as the Army used; and the skills of man management were not used as they should be. The RUC Reserve should have its own officers since people were not willing to come under the RUC officers when members of the Reserve. 
The Secretary of State said that as far as the disbandment of the ’B’ Specials was concerned, this was water under the bridge. It was not possible to legislate to bring back the ’B’ Specials. The UDR and the RUC Reserve had not taken their place even though former ’B’ Specials had found a role in the UDR. He would like to produce an outlet for ordinary people’s feelings and energies but he did not believe he could introduce any new armed force without legislation. The basis for such activities should be the UDR and the RUC Reserve. The height standards had been lowered in the RUC Reserve, and the educational standards had been lowered as far as possible, but the Police Authority was very cautious on this point. Recruitment to the RUC Reserve was very good and was especially good for recruitment to the Women’s Reserve. He was constantly trying to get the position where the Police took the lead and the Army acted in support - in aid of the civil power,which had been their original remit in 1969. He had shown his willingness to detain the first woman for 50 years and this was clear evidence of his determination. He took note of the points which had been made about the Police. These had to be seen in the wider context of the whole structure of the RUC. It had to be faced that there was a total refusal to accept the RUC in large areas of the country. At the time of Motorman’ there had been no delay before the RUC were introduced to the former ’no go’ areas, but the situation was still

very difficult and even the Army was accepted with reluctance in hard Roman Catholic areas. 
INVOLVEMENT OF THE MINORITY COMMUNITY 
The Orange Lodge suggested that the Roman Catholic population had acquiesced in terrorism. The Catholics hoped that a Republic would be brought about, and the Roman Catholic leadership had therefore been ambiguous in its condemnation of violence. The Cardinal, for example, was unrelenting about the integration of schools. Nationalists in the past had frequently abstained and it was to be hoped that only accredited Roman Catholics would be selected to take part in government. The line which was increasingly taken by Mr John Hume and others was that with the abolition of Stormont the Catholic population should work for their ultimate objective. The Secretary of State said that he believed that the Cardinal was unrelenting about schools but he was not certain whether this was a personal matter or one in which the Roman Catholic hierarchy as a whole was involved. It was a problem which pertained to the whole of the United Kingdom to some extent. He believed that many members of the Roman Catholic community did want to take part and should be given a chance to share responsibility. But it was difficult to persuade them of this. There had been notable examples, such as Dr Newe, of those who were willing to take responsibility, but he believed that there was almost a case for forcing them to take responsibility since they would otherwise be permanent critics of the Government and remain in a totally hopeless frame of mind. 
ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAW 
The Orange Lodge said that in some courts it appeared that the RUC officers were the people on trial. Protection should be given to the integrity of the evidence of RUC witnesses. The Secretary of State said that he hoped his recent statements following the publication of the Diplock Report would be helpful. The Detention of Terrorists Order had been a success and if it continued to succeed there would be a strong case for retaining it. Other reforms would help and powers would be taken where necessary. There was a major problem on prison accommodation because of the right of those now being held to be treated as remand prisoners. There was also the constant

The Ministry of Defence are letting the FCO have such information

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 6 
3 NOVEMBER 1971 Incidents in the last 24 hours There have been a total of six shooting and five tomb incidents, 
two border incidents and one ambush in the last 24 hours. Most of them took place in Belfast. 2. 
The major incident was the blowing up of a public house and a 
shop on either side of a police station in south Belfast. Two civilians 
- a man and a woman - were killed and 36 injured. One 
terrorist was caught and is in custody in hospital. (It has been decided to keep the case of this terrorist under review as it goes through the various stages of the judicial process, as an example of how the law deals with terrorists which it might be possible to use publicly at an appropriate time.) 3. 
The ambush occurred in the Ardoyne area of Belfast when a 
foot patrol of the Green Howards disturbed a trip wire which set of a Claymore mine filled with nails. Seven soldiers were injured. 4. 
The first border incident occurred when a Garda car drove a 
few hundred yards into Northern Ireland. The occupants inspected the road and then drove back across the border. The second border incident was an incursion by an Irish helicopter. 5. 
The Departments concerned are considering urgently whether 
these two border incursions should be taken up immediately with the Irish Government. RUC 6.

THEY WERE ALL MOST COURTEOUS AND RESTRAINED THROUGHOUT. IN THEIR FINAL SUMMING UP THE MESSAGE THEY HAD TO CONVEY BECAME CLEAR, AS FOLLOWS: 1. WHATEVER THE ARMY AND THE RUC DO, ENOUGH ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES WILL ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE TO MAINTAIN A TERRORIST CAMPAIGN. II. WE, THE REPUBLIC, AND DEMOCRACY WILL PAY A TERRIBLE PRICE FOR THE METHODS WE ARE EMPLOYING IN THE NORTH. III. WE ARE ONLY TINKERING WITH THE PROBLEM NOT TACKLING THE CAUSE.

PLEASE STOP LEAVING EVERYTHING TO FAULKNER AND DOING EVERYTHING TO BOLSTER HIM UP: PLEASE RE-READ AND RESTATE WHAT IT SAYS IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND ACT, WHICH IS STILL ON YOUR STATUTE BOOK.

FM DUBLIN 291407Z 
TO IMMEDIATE FCO TELEGRAM NUMBER 538 OF 29 OCTOBER, INFO IMMEDIATE UKREP BELFAST. 
BORDER INCURSIONS. 
1. THE CRATERING OPERATION WHICH BEGAN ON 13 OCTOBER WAS AVOWEDLY DESIGNED TO HINDER THE PASSAGE OF MEN AND MATERIALS BY THE IRA INTO NORTHERN IRELAND. I HAVE HAD NO REPORTS ON THE EFFICACY or THE OPERATION, BUT THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS BEING CARRIED OUT IS PRODUCING A SITUATION WHICH, AS SEEN FROM HERE, IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS OF HMG. 
2. ROAD CRATERING AND BRIDGE DEMOLITION HAVE NO CREDIBILITY IN THE SOUTH IN TERMS OF PUBLISHED SECURITY OBJECTIVES. IT IS ARUGUED HERE THAT THE DESTRUCTION OF ROADS ALONG THE BORDER IS IN FACT NO DETERRENT TO CROSS BORDER ACTIVITY BY TERRORISTS. WITH THE HELP OF THE GROWING NUMBER OF SYMPATHISERSTHAT CRATERING IS PRODUCING, THEY SIMPLY RESORT TO FOOTPATHS AND FIELDS. THE IRISH CAN SEE NO EVIDENCE TO REFUTE THIS ARGUMENT AND THEY ASSUME THAT SInCE, IN THEIR EYES, THE OPERATION IS INEPT IN MILITARY TERMS, IT WAS INTRODUCED SIMPLY TO PLACATE MR FAULKNER’S RIGHT WINGERS. THIS VIEW IS ENDORSED FOR THEM BY BRIGADIER THOMPSON IN TODAY’S ISSUE OF, OF ALL PAPERS, THE DAILY TELEGRAPH. 
3. IT IS INESCAPABLE THAT CRATERING HARD UP AGAINST A BORDER 
WHICH IS UNDEMARCATED AND APPARENTLY VARIES ACCORDING TO WHICH MAPS ARE CONSULTED, WILL LEAD TO BORDER INFRINGEMENTS BY BRITISH TROOPS. ENSUING INCIDENTS COULD LEAD TO A DANGEROUS CONFRONTATION BETWEEN BRITISH AND IRISH SECURITY FORCES. YESTERDAY’S INCIDENT AT MUNNILLY BRIDGE ON THE CO MONAGHAN BORDER ILLUSTRATES MY POINTS THE ONLY ELEMENT ABSENT WAS AN IRA AMBUSH. THE DUBLIN GOVERNMENT HAVE WISELY PLAYED THIS INCIDENT OWN, BUT FROM ALL ACCOUNTS PUBLISHED SO FAR, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE LOCATION OF THE BORDER WAS IN DISPUTE AND IT APPARENTLY REQUIRED THE OPINION OF THE LOCAL COUNTY SURVEYOR, ACTING AS A SORT OF UMPIRE, TO CAUSE THE WITHDRAWL OF BRITISH TROOPS. IRISH TROOPS TOOK UP POSITIONS ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE BORDER.

show that HMG have put themselves in a false position in two particulars. First, the Border is doubly in dispute. Not only does the Government of the Irish Republic formally claim the Six Counties, while insisting that reunification should come gradually and by consent; but the IRA, whose terrorist activities are the dominant fact in the North, are not simply thugs and gangsters. They are the violent expression of Irish nationalism north and south, whose aim is to abolish the Border. It is only their methods which moderate Irishmen deplore. Thus a young couple who blow themselves up or a small child placing a bomb, in the eyes of the majority of the Irish are the modern martyrs and heroes. They deplore the necessity, but they would argue that it is forced upon the IRA by Unionist methods of suppressing the Catholics with our support. In this sense, so far from the Border not being in dispute, the dispute, and all that follows it, is about the Border. 
An objective and critical reappraisal as of 1971 might

But so long as HM leave the decision about reunification to a Stormont majority, and so long as the operative parliamentary decisions are left to Stormont, that is so long as the Unionists can be judges in their own cause, the Border remains. So also will remain the IRA terrorists, the sympathy and practical support of the minority, the growth of old-type Republicanism in the South, and the polarisation of the North. 
The Irish Government the Northern minority and the 8. This analysis is not designed to advocate any particular 
policy.

whether it is really true that we would have no objection to reunification, or whether the truth is that we have plenty of objections but by leaving Stormont to hold that particular baby we can profess a pious but sham detachment. It might emerge that we were positively in favour of reunification, if an objective study of all the political, economic, social and religious aspects pointed that way. 
9. Even if much out-of-date prejudice and ignorance about 
the Republic is swept away, there remains the great stumbling block of the million protestants in the North, and the belief that to a man they would launch a civil war rather than contemplate any constitutional change. This may correctly describe the present attitude of most (but not all of them) but they have never had any reason to suppose that they would ever have to put it to the test, knowing that HMG had left the Border in the hands of unionist Stormont. They should not of course be exposed to a 
sudden shock; but it is worth 
considering whether the political climate in the North would or would not be improved if they began to feel the seeds of doubt about the immutability of HMG s attitude towards reunification. In any case, "Protestant" and "Catholic" do not properly described the contending parties. The Church of Ireland has far more in common with enlightened Catholicism than it has with Paisley. 
10. There remains the belief that because the IRA are 
active any trace of political movement would be a concession to violence. This seems fallacious. If the effect of violence is to call attention to the political situation that has produced it, and political action removes the support without which terrorism cannot prosper, that is scarcely a concession. 
physical suppression of the IRA by military means is making any political solution remote, if not impossible, and whether the political damage that we are doing to ourselves, eg by the stimulus given to civil disobedience, does not outweigh any military advantage. 
And we have to consider whether the temporary 11. To sum up, the following steps seem called for:- 
(i) A fresh look at all the assumptions upon which Stormont and Partition are based, to see whether they are still valid in 1971. 
(ii) On Stormont, to examine means of resolving the democratic contradiction by transferring certain

I hope you will let all those concerned know how much we appreciate their efforts.

There were further disturbances in Londonderry. In the Creggan area, the throwing of petrol and nail bombs - which had commenced 
during the small hours - continued, and shots by the Army are thought to have hit a further two terrorists (in addition to the three gunmen and one petrol bomber mentioned in yesterday’s report). Throughout the day, gangs of hooligans roamed through the Bogside stoning Army units, who fired baton rounds to disperse them; and there was intermittent sniper fire, which caused no military casualties and which was returned.

The Government are grateful to the rt hon Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition for his support of the decision to set up this enquiry and hope that he will shortly be able to nominate a Privy Councillor so that the enquiry can begin work

But the situation has changed - and everyone must feel sympathy for the senior policeman who said the other day "Most of us were quite happy to lose our guns because we realised this would help us to hang on to the civilian role. But unfortunately the present terror campaign against the RUC makes the idea of an ordinary British type police force impossible. You cannot expect a man to walk about the streets unarmed when he knows he is a target for dozens of gunmen."

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 230700 to 260700 HOURS JUN 72 GENERAL 
1. Violence has continued unabated except in Londonderry where it was relatively quiet During the period there were 173 shooting incidents, 82 of them involving 
the Security Forces. The great majority were in BELFAST, particularly in ANDERSONSTOWN, where IRA tactics were reported to be 
and 16 hits in all 
against gunmen were claimed without Security Force casualties. The main weight of explosions was in the rural areas, and the targets were widely scattered. Near DUNGIVEN, in the early hours of Saturday morning, 3 soldiers were killed and 2 VSI as a result of a mining incident for which the Provisionals later claimed responsibility. On the border there were a variety of minor incidents. Armed robberies totalled 27, a noticeable increase. All in all, it seems reasonable to conclude that the Provisionals are anxious to emphasie the expected contrast pre and post cease fire. Elsewhere, GB weekend press comment concentrated on the steps leading up to the cease fire proposal, and prospects for its observance. In the USA, a federal grand jury is reported to be investigating charges of gun. running to the IRA. 
2. During Fri/Sat 23 - 24 Jun 72. Three soldiers were killed, two 
soldiers and a civilian were seriously wounded in an incident when a landrover was mined near Dungiven, Co Londonderry. A report is at Annex A. In other incidents one civilian was shot dead and two were wounded in incidents not involving the SF and there were two other minor military casualties. There were 47 shooting incidents of which 16 involved the SF. In Belfast most of the shooting incidents were in the Andersonstown area. Londonderry was very quiet with one shooting incident and one hi-jacking. In the Border and Rural Areas there were five explosions and five armed 
In the most 
serious raid a bank in Newry was robbed of £52,000. 3. During Sat/Sun 24 - 25 Jun 72. 
There were 83 shooting incidents 
of which 3 involved the SF. Two civilians were killed, one soldier and two civilians were wounded and four hits were claimed on terrorists. One of the wounded civilians was a 10 year old girl and in this incidentwhich occurred in the Falls area of Belfast, the SF did not fire. In Belfast there was a four hour sustained period of firing during the night in Andersonstown during which it is estimated that the terrorists fired 300 rounds and the SF replied with 89 rounds,claiming four hits. There was also a find of 200 lbs of explosives in the New Lodge area. In Londonderry there were five shooting incidents with the SF being involved in four. In the Border and Rural areas there were seven shooting incidents, four involving the SF and a LAW rally at Ballymena attended by 1,500 people at which there were no incidents.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND SDLP REPRESENTATIVES (MR HUME AND MR DEVLIN) AT THE OFFICE OF THE UK REPRESENTATIVE AT 12 20 PM ON SUNDAY, 18 JUNE 1972 
Mr Hume said that he and Mr Devlin had discussed with MacStiofain and O’Connell the possibility of an immediate cease fire. In response MacStiofain and O’Connell had asked that the Secretary of State should meet O’Connell and Gerald Adams, at present interned, on neutral ground. The Provisionals’ delegates intended to propose to the Secretary of State that he should give an assurance that there would be no harassment by the security forces (by which he appeared to mean no "lifting" for offences committed up to the date of the cease fire) and that there should be recognition of the demands of the "political" prisoners. In return the Provisionals would publicly declare an immediate and indefinite cease fire. The SDLP representatives said that they found it difficult to believe the rumours of a split in the ranks of the Provisionals. O’Connell himself had said that it was not true. Both O’Connell and MacStiofain were fully committed to the proposed meeting and the Provisionals’ delegates would be fully empowered to reach agreement. For all their terrorist activities, such an agreement would be honoured by the Provisionals. But the SDLP representatives urged the Secretary of State to respond quickly to the invitation; any delay would give MacStiofain and other extremists a chance to break away and re-assert their dominance. There was, say, a 10 per cent risk that the meeting would become public knowledge before it took place. If it subsequently became public knowledge the cease fire would already have been declared. In any event the risk was worth taking. They had consulted the Provisionals about the possibility of an intermediary attending a meeting on behalf of the Secretary of State, but this had been rejected. 
The Secretary of State said that he had to preserve the position of the SDLP as the elected representatives of the people. Any discussions would therefore have to be conducted under their "banner"; the position of the SDLP would otherwise be undermined. There should be no difficulty in reaching agreement about "harassment". It would not be possible to give prisoners "political" status, but they could be accommodated in a separate compound and they could probably be allowed to wear their own clothes and perhaps to receive additional letters and

visits. It would however be extremely difficult for him to attend the proposed meeting at this stage particularly if it proved unsuccessful. The Prov.isionals ought to realise this and be prepared to accept the attendance on behalf of the Secretary of State of someone of known public standing who could not be repudiated. There could be no question of negotiations; if a cease fire were achieved a new situation would arise. 
In discussion the SDLP said that they thought the Secretary of State’s proposal in respect of "political" prisoners would be acceptable. They accepted that it would be difficult for the Secretary of State to attend the meeting. But they were concerned at the delay in arranging for an intermediary. There would be no prospect of an unannounced cease fire taking effect in the meantime. There would be the risk thaty extremist groups would not respect an unannounced cease fire; moreover there was an additional group - 
Saor Eire - engaging in terrorist activities. 
In further discussion it was agreed that the SDLP should consult the Provisionals on whether they would be prepared to see an emissary who would be able to produce a document signed by the Secretary of State saying that he was authorised to speak onbehalf of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State said that meanwhile he would consult the Prime Minister. 
Later 
The Secretary of State said that he had consulted the Prime Minister who had agreed that the Secretary of State should be represented by an emissary at this stage. If this were not acceptable to the Provisionals he would need to consult the Cabinet about the possibility of his attendance. 
Later 
The SDLP representatives said that they had consulted O’Connell and it had been agreed that the Secretary of State should be represented by an emissary. He would need to be accompanied by one of the Secretary of State’s officials in confirmation of his authority to speak on behalf of the Secretary of State. 
It was agreed that the publicly announced meeting between the Secretary n

incident in the Ardoyne area had been a great shock to them as well as to everyone else. He had given the Protestant community repeated assurances on the Border; but they remained anxious for their position to be understood. They also wanted assurances that the security forces were prepared actively to pursue gunmen. The "no go" areas in Londonderry were a continuing affront to the Protestant community although many of them failed to appreciate the issues and had never been to Londonderry. In his talks with the UDA he had made it clear that a military operation in the "no go" areas would be possible, but that this would result in serious casualties and in particular would lead to bitterness that would last many years. He had also made it clear that the withdrawal of social security benefits would be undesirable. He had not ruled out the possibility of a defensive cordon around the "no go" areas to prevent terrorists from using it as a haven from which to carry on their activities. 
In discussion on the ending of violence the SDLP representatives said that the Provisionals would not respond to pleas or argument; they needed to be exposed to political pressures. If the Secretary of State took the risk of a complete end to internment the pressures on the Provisionals to end violence would be irresistible. There would then also be an opportunity to end civil disobedience and to undertake positive talks on the opening of the "no go" areas. It was a risk worth taking. The Secretary of State said that he could not risk ending internment without an end of violence. If major acts of terrorism took place after the ending of internment his position would be impossible. If there were a genuine end of terrorism,even for a limited period, there would be a genuine response from the Governmentand,subject to consultations with his colleagues, he did not rule out the ending of internment in these circumstances. 
In discussion on the "no go" areas of Londonderry the SDLP said that the problem was essentially political. There was no difficulty in entering the areas, many people did so without harrassment every day. The Secretary of State said that arrangements had been made for the Londonderry Commission to proceed with community projects in the Bogside The next step might be for him or a junior Minister to visit the sites and inspect the work actually being done. This would help to break down the mythology of the "no go" areas. Another possibility would be

Provisionals to represent themselves as the protectors of the Roman Catholic community 
- a position which they were already trying to take 
up. He hoped the UDA would decide not to continue with their plans. If they nevertheless decided to do so he hoped that they would be prepared to discuss with the security forces how the protest could be mounted without giving an excuse for sectarian violence. In particular he asked that any barriers erected in Belfast should be temporary and preferably should not block the main roads. He could give an undertaking that there would be no amnesty on civil disobedience. He welcomed the delegation’s recognition that there should be no invasion of the ’no go’ areas in Londonderry. An invasion would no doubt be possible, but there would be serious injuries in Londonderry and elsewhere and bitterness would remain for many years. A barricade around the ’no go’ areas would be likely to lead to an increase in sectarian strife; the suspension of social security payments would probably result in their replacement by funds from the United States. 
In discussion the delegation made the following further points: a. 
The Army were failing to follow up specific incidents of 
terrorism, and in particular were failing to pursue armed men. b. 
to another three years of violence and frustration. c. 
They would prefer a barricade of the ’no go’ areas in Londonderry If they established ’no go’ areas in Belfast the Army would be 
bound to act both against them and against the ’no go’ areas in Londonderry. The positive action they were demanding would thereby be forced upon the Secretary of State. 
d. The Protestant community were particularly incensed by the fact 
that the City Cemetery in Londonderry was inaccessible. e. 
The local employment exchange in Frederick Street, Belfast, was 
in a "hostile" area. The Protestants in Belfast wanted an exchange in the Shankill Road and another in East Belfast. 
f. They did not accept that the financial support of Harland and 
Wolff and the consequent improvement in employment opportunities was a significant gesture towards the Protestant community. Great Britain needed the Harland and Wolff shipyard, the only yard in the United Kingdom able to compete effectively with Japan.

conference. 
SECURITY OUTLOOK The 14 days suspension of activity by the UDA may be used by them for organizing and planning, in order to make themselves more capable of effective action should they think the need is there. It does not seem likely at present that they would resort to extensive industrial action for political reasons. The behaviour of the Provisionals is becoming so erratic that their activities are increasingly difficult to foresee. A change of policy or of leader does now seem more likely. 
BROADCAST Mr Whitelaw is to give a broadcast speech on Ulster T.V., in which he will review the state of affairs and ask for the momentum towards peace to be maintained. 
SOUTH ROCK LIGHT-SHIP Advice from the ambassador in Dubin makes it appear desireable not to take action over this light-ship for some 14 days. If a search still appears called for, the security forces will undertake it. "TERROR AND TEARS" 80,000 copies of this publication are still held. They are not to be given a general issue, but are available to the public on request.

As regards the administration of justice the Attorney General’s 
memorandum (GEN 79(72) 8) is largely informative; and he does not ask his colleagues for any specific decisions. 
wish to discuss some of the following points which it raised in the context of the more conciliatory atmosphere which should prevail if the Secretary of State’s political initiative goes well:(a) The Criminal Law The Attorney General’s memorandum discloses a disturbing state of affairs. to:- 
(i) 
secure from the RUC the report of their investigation of the most recent allegations of ill-treatment. Why is this taking so long? 
(ii) 
ensure that instructions are issued to the RUC on the importance of distinguishing between the type of questioning appropriate to a prisoner against whom charges are likely to be brought in court and the type appropriate when the object is simply to secure intelligence. 
(The actual 
conduct of interrogation for intelligence purposes will be discussed later in the meeting.) 
We have also to decide whether, given the Attorney General’s judgment that some 30 pending prosecutions will have to be abandoned, the persons concerned should be re-arrested under the Special Powers Act (paragraph 4). Several of those whose arrests on 9th August, 1971, were judged invalid on purely technical grounds were immediately re-arrested under a valid formula. To re-arrest persons against whom prosecutions had been pending but had been dropped might, however, be open to wider criticism in so far as there was evidently no case to back up the suspicion upon which the individual had been arrested. On the other hand, what will be the reaction of "Loyalists" to the release of detainees on what will be said to be mere legal technicalities, comparable to those on which known terrorists have repeatedly been discharged in the Republic? 
Nevertheless, the meeting may In particular it is becoming increasingly urgent

14th June 1972 In your letter of 6th June to Robert Andrew you mentioned 
the Prime Minister’s hope that action would be taken to refute press reports that a high proportion of those so far released from internment had returned to terrorist activity. 
When the Daily Express article to this effect appeared 
on 2nd June, we at once checked with Headquarters Northern Ireland exactly what was known on the point. The answer was that there were reports of varying reliability that up to 25 (of 380 or so who had been released by them) had returned to more or less active membership of the IRA - 
which did not 
necessarily mean that they had themselves become active terrorists again. This is obviously a very much smaller proportion than the one-quarter alleged by the Daily Express. 
HQNI confirmed 
that none of their officers had given any figures on the subject to the Express (which did not actually attribute this one-quarter theory to a military spokesman). 
You will be aware that Mr. Whitelaw made some references to 
this point in answering Questions on 8th June (Hansard, Cols. 678-9) and during the Debate on 12th June (Col. 1077). We consider that these references are a sufficient refutation of the press reports, and that any further more direct action might well be counter-productive. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Platt. Nevertheless, we shall use 
any opportunity which presents itself to correct the mistaken impression in these reports. 
(R.A. CUSTIS) The Lord Bridges.

A Round Table Conference (CP(72) 59) 
The Secretary of State has rephrased his proposal in terms going 
no further than "entering into immediate preparatory discussions with a view to a Round Table Conference on the future of Northern Ireland". And the purpose of the Conference itself is now described (paragraph 4) as only "to promote a constructive exchange of views and to try to arrive at a series of issues which could be reported to the Government and would then become one basis for the Government’s consideration of the next move". This represents a prudent lowering of the sights by comparison with the Secretary of State’s earlier thinking; and, if the Government are to be spared subsequent embarrassment, it is important that the initial announcement should avoid arousing excessive hopes by emphasising from the outset the deliberately restricted scope of the discussions. If those discussions go better than we expect, nobody will complain; and, if they go worse, nobody will be entitled to be disappointed. What matters is simply being seen to take an initiative, however tentative. 2. 
Even so, there are several questions which the announcement of even 
this limited first step is likely to provoke at once - not least from those who would say that there must be a marked improvement in the security situation before there can be any attempt of any kind to reach a political solution. The Secretary of State would presumably meet this particular criticism on the lines of paragraph 6. Nevertheless, the Cabinet may wish to ask him how highly he rates the chances of an end to violence in fact; what he foresees as the reaction of the "Provisional" wing of the IRA; and whether he proposes to go forward whether or not violence ceases and whether or not all the main interests concerned agree to take part in the discussions. In particular, what is the basis of his confidence that the SDLP would agree to participate even without a prior termination of internment? 3. 
The Secretary of State suggests that the nucleus of the Conference 
should be drawn from the re cognised political Parties in Northern Ireland and that there can be no question of the inclusion of representatives of terrorists. This is surely right; and it is probably no less right - the nature of the Conference as now envisaged - to exclude the political 
given 
Parties in the United Kingdom as a whole. The British Government should keep themselves uninvolved and uncommitted, free to deal with the second stage as they judge best in the light of the outcome of the first. And, if we are to try to maintain a bipartisan policy at Westminster, this should be true

Annex A to A/BR/290/4/M04 Dated 31 July 1972 
SITREP ON OPERATION MOTORMAN AS AT 310700A JUL General 
1. The reinforcement phase (OP GLASSCUTTER) went smoothly and was completed during the early afternoon of Sunday. 
2. The deployment of the 27 units in the infantry role was 14 to BELFAST (11 in 39 Bde and 3 in 24 Bde); 8 to LONDONDERRY (all in 8 Bde); and 5 in the rural areas (4 in 3 Bde and 1 in 8 Bde). 
3. CLF’s directive for the operation was duly amended to meet Ministerial direction, and the amended order was formally cleared by SSNI on 31 July. The amended first page together with Annex A on arrest policy and Annex B on information policy have been issued separately. 
4. Information Policy. The texts of SSNI’s RTE broadcast on Friday evening where it concerns security matters; and the press association reports of his statements at 2130rs on Sunday and 0650hrs on Monday are at 
5. RUC Assistance. SSNI asked the GOC at 0530hrs on Monday for military clerical and administrative assistance at certain police offices. Details will be available in due course from BGS(Int). 
6. The operation itself has so far gone according to plan with little or no resistance. The terrorists have clearly gone to ground rather than stand and fight, unless they were genuinely surprised by the speed of the operation, which is oubtful. In LODONDERRY 6 terrorist gunmen and 1 petrol bomber are claimed hit. There have been no civilian or SF casualties. Permanent patrol bases are now being established for four framework battalions. All barricades are being removed. The UDA is removing its own in the Waterside with Army assistance. It is hoped to be able to withdraw the AVRE armoured bulldozers in time for them to sail in HMS FEARLESS on the noon tide on Monday. (The AVREs were invaluable in clearing the major obstacles). In BELFAST all extremist strongholds have been penetrated and patrol bases are being established. There have been no casualties. Barricades are being removed, IRA ones by SF and UDA ones voluntarily. In the rural areas hard core districts in PORTADOWN, LURGAN, ARMAGH and NE RY have been occupied without oppositio Barricades are being removed. Detailed comments follow below 
.. 
7. As for the immediate future, heavy patrolling and selective searching will continue from firm bases once established. A few arrests will be made today, with more to follow. Some form of IRA propaganda counter blast must be 
expected, probably based as usual on false allegations of SF ’brutality.’ 8. Sitreps. No further special sitreps will be issued unless the situation

EXTRACTS FROM MR WHITELAW’S STATEMENTS 1. Friday 28 July. Interview for RTE (Republic of Ireland) 
Annex A to A/BR/29C/ 4 /M04 Dated 31 July 1972 
a. Question. Mr Whitelaw, could I begin by asking you why you have decided to send another four thousand troops to the North? 
b. Answer. 
I think one has to start from last Friday, described all over the world in many places as ’bloody Friday’. It certainly was. The most inhumane killings of men, women and children. Clearly designed to be so, which shows that the Provisional IRA were determined to pursue violence and, if necessary to wreck the whole community in Northern Ireland in pursuit of their objectives. That was a clear challenge which had to be faced, and it will be faced. 
I want to 
make it perfectly clear that I oust protect the law-abiding community from terrorists and gunmen who are seeking to wreck the whole place. That cannot be, and for that reason I must see that the Security Forces are enabled to go freely throughout the whole community. 
nd they will be. And if that is to be the case, then 
I must make it abundantly clear that if they are to be able to move freely then all barricades from wherever they are put up, whoever put then up, Protestant barricades, Roman Catholic barricades all of them, the whole lot, must come down so that the Security Forces can move freely. I hope people will take them down themselves, if they don’t, I must make it perfectly clear that the Security Forces would have to do so in the interests of stopping killing and maiming of innocent men, women and children. 
c. Question. 
Are you saying, in fact, that the troops will move against the No-Go areas. 
d. Answer. hat I am saying, and making perfectly clear is that the troops 
are there to stop acts of inhumanity. They are there to see that they can dove freely about the community in order to stop the sort of killings and troubles that we had last Friday. That really cannot happen in any community. 
2. Sunday 30 July. Statement from Stormont. "From the time of this announcement there will be substantial 
activity by the Security Forces in various parts of Northern Ireland. Tho object is to enable the Security Forces to move freely 
throughout all areas and so to protect the whole community. Where such activity is taking place people will best assist the 
Security Forces and protect themselves by keeping off the streets."

TO IMMEDIATE DUBLIN TELNO 181 OF 29/7 INFO UKREP BELFAST. FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF MESSAGE FROM PRIME MINISTER TO MR LYNCH. I SHOULD LIKE TO SEND YOU THIS PERSONAL MESSAGE AT WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE SOMETHING OF A TURNING POINT IN THE AFFAIRS OF NORTHERN IRELAND SINCE HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT TOOK OVER FULL RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND IN MARCH, WE HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT IN OUR POWER TO END VIOLENCE TO ENCOURAGE ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY TO TAKE PART IN THE SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF THE PROVINCE, AND TO WORK FOR RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THEM. AS YOU KNOW, MR WHITELAW HAS MADE A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN THE NUMBERS OF THOSE INTERNED: HE IS PLANNING FOR LOCAL ELECTIONS LATER THIS YEAR IN WHICH PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION IS TO BE REINTRODUCED: 
AND HE HAS 
INVITED VIEWS ON POLITICALSOLUTIONS FROM ALL QUARTERS WITH THE AIM OF HOLDING A CONFERENCE IN THE AUTUMN. AT THE SAME TIME THE ACTIVITY OF THE SECURITY FORCES HAS BEEN KEPT TO A LOW LEVEL EVEN AT THE RISK OF MUCH MISUNDERSTANDING ON THE PART OF THE PROTESTANTS. IN SHORT, EVERYTHING POSSIBLE HAS BEEN DONE TO SET THE AFFAIRS OF THE PROVINCE ON A NEW COURSE. UNFORTUNATELY, OUR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN THWARTED BY THE ACTIONS 
OF THE PROVISIONAL IRA. DESPITE THE BRIEF CEASEFIRE, THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THEIR CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE, THAT THEY HAVE THE DELIBERATE AIM OF PREVETING RECONCiLIATION AND THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO USE EVERY METHOD OF INTIMIDATION TO DETER THE ROMAN CATHOLIC COMMUNITY FROM JOINING IN THE SEARCH FOR POLITICAL SOLUTIONS. IN DOING SO, THEY HAVE INEVITABLY PROVOKED EXTREMISTS AMONG THE PROTESTANTS WHO HAVE RESPONDED TO THE IRA CHALLENGE BY A MEASURE OF VIOLENCE AND BY SETTING UP THEIR OWN BARRICADES. THIS HAS PRODUCED A DANGEROUS SITUATION IN WHICH VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING, AND LAW AND ORDER PROGRESSIVELY BREAKING DOWN. MOREVER, THE PROVISIONALS SHOWED BY THEIR CAREFULLY PLANNED AND CONCERTED CAMPAIGN OF EXPLOSIONS IN BELFAST ON FRIDAY, 21 JULY A CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR THE LIVES

OF MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN ALL COMMUNITIES. THESE MURDEROUS ATTACKS, WHEN ADDED TO A SIMILAR EXPLOSIVE CAMPAIGN IN LONDONDERRY WHICH HAS WRECKED THE CENTRE OF THE CITY, AND TO A HIGH INTENSITY OF SHOOTING THROUGHOUT NORTHERN IRELAND, HAVE CAUSED A LEVEL OF DESTRUCTION AND OF DISORDER WHICH IS BRINGING THE LIFE OF THE PROVINCE PROGRESSIVELY TO A HALT. IN THIS SITUATION, THE POSSIBILITY OF A POLITICAL PROGRESS HAS BEEN RECEDING 
, AND THE 
PROSPECT HAS BECOME ONE OF AN INCREASING DOMINATION OF ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY BY EXTREMEISTS, AND STILL MORE DESTRUCTION AND VIOLENCE. I HAVE DISCUSSED THE SITUATION THOROUGHLY WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND 
WE HAVE REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT WE CANNOT ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE. W HAVE THEREFORE DECIDED THAT WE MUST MAKE A NEW AND DETERMINED EFFORT TO RESTORE LAW AND ORDER THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCE. WE MUST BE ABLE TO TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTION AGAINST THE TERRORISTS: AND TO DO SO WE NEED TO END A SITUATION IN WHICH THEY HAVE SAFE HAVENS FROM WHICH THEY CAN COME OUT AT WILL TO DESTROY AND SHOOT, AND WHERE THEY CAN BE SURE OF INTIMIDATING THE PEACEABLE MEMBERS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE THEREFORE GIVEN ORDERS FOR OPERATIONS TO BE UNDERTAKEN IN LONDONDERRY AND BELFAST TO THIS END. THESE WILL START EARLY ON MONDAY 31 JULY. YOU WILL I KNOW BE CONCERNED THAT THESE OPERATIONS MIGHT HAVE 
THE OPPOSITE EFFECT TO WHAT WE INTEND, BY FRIGHTENING THE ROMAN CATHOLIC COMUNITY, MAKING THEM BELIEVE THAT OUR FORCES ARE PURSUING A SECTARIAN POLICY, AND THUS ENABLING THE PROVISIONAL IRA TO POSE AS THEIR DEFENDERS AND AS THE UPHOLDERS OF THEIR POLITICAL CUASE. I SHOULD THEREFORE LIKE TO ASSURE YOU THAT OUR ACTION IS AIMEDONLY AT THE TERRORISTS AND GUNMEN. OUR POLITICAL OBJECTIVES REMAIN UNCHANGED. WE INTEND THAT ALL BARRICADES SHALL COME DOWN IMMEDIATELY 
, UDA AS WELL AS IRA. THE ARMY HAS BEEN 
GIVEN CATEGORICAL INSTRUCTIONS TO TAKE UTMOST CARE TO AVOID ENDAANGERING THE LIVES AND PROPERTY OF INNOCENT PEOPLE, AND TO ASSURE THE SECURITY OF THOSE BEHIND THE BARRICADES AS ELSEWHERE. IT IS OUR INTENTION THAT, AS A RESULT OF THESE OPERATIONS AGAINST 
THE GUNMEN, POLITICAL PROGRESS WILL BE EASIER TO ACHIEVE. IN FURTHERANCE OF THIS AIM, MR WHITELAW WILL CONTINUE HIS CONSULTATIONS AND I GREATLY WELCOMED THE ANNOUNCEMET THAT THE SDLP WERE NOW READY FOR TALKS. PLANNING FOR A CONFERENCE WILL GO AHEAD. IN ALL THIS WE SHALL HOPE TO KEEP IN THE CLOSEST TOUCH WITH YOU AND YOUR GOVERNMENT. MR WHITELAW WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE DR HILLERY 
A WEEK AGO, AND WE SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE REGULAR CONFIDENTIAL CONTACTS TO HAKE SURE THAT EACH OF US UNDERSTANDS THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE OTHER AS THE SITUATION EVOLVES. IN THE MEANTIME, I HOPE I CAN HAVE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHY WE HAVE JUDGED IT RIGHT TO GO AHEAD WITH ThESE OPERATIONS. IF WE HAD NOT DONE SO WE COULD ONLY SEE A STEADILY DETERIORATING SITUATION. I HOPE ALSO THAT I MAY COUNT OF YOUR CONTINUING HELP IN DEALING WITH THE IRA GUNMEN, IF AND WHEN THEY CROSS INTO THE REPUBLIC. I KNOW THAT YOU RECOGNISE THAT THEY ARE A THREAT TO PEACE AND JUSTICE THROUGHOUT IRELAND.

Elsewhere the move of reinforcements was completed without major snags by the early afternoon of Sunday. 
In GB, 
weekend press comment was full of speculation about the uses to which they might be put and when. SSNI made public statements on RTE on Friday evening and in Belfast on Sunday evening foreshadowing substantial military activity. These matters will be reported separately.

peaceful settlement. But last Friday the Provisional 
IRA, having broken the cease-fire they asked for and were given, launched a murderous and indiscriminate attack upon the citizens of Belfast which resulted in casualities to the civilian population of both communities - 
Catholics as well as Protestants, which has earned for that day the name of Bloody Friday. Since 
then there has been continued violence by the Provisional IRA both by bombing and shooting, and in the last fortyeight hours bombs have been exploded in the streets and event close to a hospital. 
There can now be no 
conceivable doubt in the mind of anybody that the Provisional IRA is determined to enforce its will on the Government and the population by indiscriminate and murderous violence. 
Inevitably, the continuation of 
this violence is bound to cause,and is probably intended to cause,an increasing and vient reaction in the Protestant community. 
Her Majesty’s Government have, 
therefore, faced the prospect of increasing lawlessness unless decisive steps are taken to put an end to the terror. 
This we are now about to do. The Army has been 
substantially reinforced, and in co-operation with the police, have been ordered to occupy those areas from which the severe bombing and shooting attacks on the civil population have been mounted, to take down the barricades and search out the terrorists and their equipment, and to ensure that there are no obstacles to free movement of the security forces and of citizens

in any area in the Province. Unless this action is 
taken,bombing and shooting incidents will go on and there might well be a reptition of Bloody Friday, No Government can tolerate this state of affairs, and we have decided to stop it. 
The Government has instructed the Security Forces 
that their actions are to be directed against terrorists and terrorism,/to restore law and order and freedom of movement throughout the Province. 
They have been 
instructed to do so in such a way as to cause the minimum of danger, hardship and inconvenience to everyone who is not a terrorist and to use the minimum of force necessary to achieve the Government’s objectives. These include, once terrorism is suppressed, the further development of the political and economic initiatives which the Government is already taking in order to bring about a new political settlement of the affairs of the Province, the regeneration of its economy, and the provision of work for its citizens. 
Because the terrorists take refuge in and operate 
from the midst of the civil population, all peace-loving citizens can help by staying indoors whilst the Army is dealing with the terrorists. 
You will understand that 
I cannot tell you exactly where, when and how our actions to remove the terrorists and the barriers to free movement will take place, because if I did I should at the same time be telling the terrorists. 
But our 
actions will start very shortly and I am therefore asking you. when you see or hear the Security Forces taking

action, to stay in your houses and to deny shelter so far as you can to the terrorists. 
This is the only 
way in which the evil of terrorism can be rooted out and a normal and peaceful life restored to a Province which is sick of violence and wants to lead its life in peace. 
It has been very hard for us to take the decision 
to use the most severe measures because this cannot be done without some risk to the civil population. That is why we have first tried to bring peace to the Province by discussion. 
But no Government can tolerate or lend 
support to the continuation of terrorism and the threat of another Bloody Friday. 
I aks you, therefore, to co- 
operate with the Government and its Security Forces in the measures which are now necessary and are now being taken to eliminate terrorism, to support the removal in all areas of the barriers to free movement throught the Province and to stay in your houses when the action of the Security Forces is resisted. 
I am sure that we can together give this beautiful Province the peaceful and orderly life it deserves. 
If you will do that,

OPERATIONS OF THE SECURITY FORCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
The security forces in Northern Ireland have taken 
steps to restore the authority of the law throughout the Province and to make sure that thesecurity-forces can operate freely in all areas. 
For 3 years Northern Ireland has been divided by communal strife and bitterness. 800 of its citizens have 
-been killed as-well-as 100 members of the security forces. Its cities and towns have been devastated by terrorist bombing and firing in the streets both by day and by night has become an ordinary feature of life in many parts of the country. This state of disorder cannot go on if the economic and social life of Northern Ireland are to continue in any meaningful form and for its law abiding citizens to enjoy the normal and peaceful life which is their right. 
Since the end of the cease fire alone members of the UDR and 
have been killed and soldiers, members of the RUC soldiers have been injured. 
civilians have lost their lives, most of them in the murderous bombing which took place on Friday 21 July when 
27 explosions occurred within a 31/2 hour period: an action N 
which as the Secretary said in the House of Commons 
on 24 July, must have deprived those who perpetrated them of any remaining shred of support."Even those sections of

Roman Catholic opinion throughout the world which have traditionally identified themselves with and perhaps sometimes given the benefit of the doubt to any group of men who claimed to speak for the Irish Republican movement can surely no longer continue to uphold the men who were responsible for Friday’s horrible catalogue of slaughter". 
Since the United Kingdom Government was entrusted with 
responsibility for Northern Irish affairs they have made unremitting efforts to secure an end of violence and a new future for the community. This twin policy was pursued with= patience and tolerancewith a view to moving forward through reconciliation. After the bombing attack on Belfast on 21 July - Bloody Friday as it has been called 
- the Government 
have been resolved to destroy the capacity of the Provisional IRA for further acts of inhumanity. Since then the security forces have carried out searches for arms, explosives and terrorists with some degree of success. But clearly there had to be a time beyond which we could not tolerate a situation in which terrorists had safe havens in the cities and towns of Northern Ireland from which to come and do their bloody work. Nor could we tolerate a situation in which the security forces were hindered by barricades from moving freely to carry out their duty of protecting the life and property of the citizens of Northern Ireland. The Government therefore decided after very anxious consideration to use severe measures to establish the authority of the law.and. are instructed to occupy those areas from which the severe

shooting and bombing attacks had been mounted, to take down the barricades wherever and by whom so ever they had been erected, to search out the terrorists and their wepons and explosives and to ensure freedom of movement for the security forces and the civilian population in all areas of Northern Ireland. The security forces were given particular instructions to carry out their duty in such a way as to case the minimum danger, hardship and inconvenience to law abiding citizens and to use the minimum of force necessary. to 
carry--out-their instructions. 
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in a broadcast last Friday urged the removal of the barricades and on Sunday night gave specific warning that the steps which have now been taken were unavoidable. 
It must be emphasized that there is no change in the 
general objectives of the Government’s policy in Northern Ireland. They were and they remain the destruction of the capacity of the IRA to terrorise the country and the creation of an atmosphere in which the political future of the country can be discussed freely by men of good will. The operations of the security forces against terrorists and law breakers are not directed against any section of the community at large, they have been taken for the protection of the community because it is the Government’s aim to secure that all citizens of Northern Ireland of whatever political view or religious creed should have

NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 21 July - 27 July, 1972 
Memorandum by the Northern Ireland Office GENERAL 
1. The explosions in Belfast on the afternoon of 21 July have led to intensified operations by the security forces against the Provisional IRA. The bombings have been condemned by practically every section of opinion. The SDLP has agreed to meet the Government formally for discussion on the future. The UDA has broken away from the Ulster Vanguard over the latter’s call for a rent ad rates strike. It has also threatened to take action against the Provisionals and their "no-go" areas. Mr Faulkner has promised support for the Government if the present security policy is continued. 
REACTIONS TO FRIDAY’S EXPLOSIONS IN BELFST 
2. Following the bombings on Friday, the Provisional IRA issued a statement in which they claimed responsibility, but said adequate warnings were given. Their action, however, was universally condemned. Mr Whitelaw issued a statement on Friday deploring the "slaughter of men, women and children which took place today on Provisional IRA orders, clearly acting with the utmost ferocity. In the light of these murderous attacks, the Ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith". 
3. A debate on Northern Ireland took place on Monday at Westminster. During the debate, Mr Whitelaw said that in dealing with the IRA they were not dealing with a struggle between two communities, but with a force that as the enemy of them both. The Government had twin objectives in its policy for Northern Ireland: "Our first objective must be to destroy the capacities of the Provisional IRA who terrorise the community In destroying the IA’s capacity to terrorise the community, it must be our objective to maintain the understanding and goodwill of all communities in Northern Ireland.

Preventive Detention for Terrorist Conduct The capacity of the Provisional IRA (or of any other 
terrorist orgaisation) to engage in terrorism will not be effectively destroyed until all its important members are removed. It will be possible to charge some with criminal offences under the ordinary law; but others and perhaps the most important of them are beyond the reach of the criminal law partly because witnesses cannot be expected to come forward to give oral evidence in the ordinary way, and partly because the evidence available to connect accused persons with specific offences as opposed to general complicity in terrorism is sometimes tenuous,particularly in the case of the most important provisional IRA leaders. Any action we take must be such as not to alienate the minority community as a whole: a consideration which must rule out the further use of internment in the arbitrary form which it now takes under the Special Powers Act. 
The most promising possibility is to create a system 
of special courts whose function would not be to convict accused persons of criminal offences, but to judge whether they were guilty of certain specified conduct and commit them to "preventive detention" if they were. The Act making this provision (as to the necessity of an Act see below) could be of 6 months duration renewable by Order in Council. The provision would apply to conduct involving complicity in any degree with terrorism generally; it

OPERATION MOTORMAN 
The Secretary of State for Defence has requested me, acting for the Chief of the Defence Staff, to send to you the following directions, based on the decisions taken by Ministers on 27 July 1972 in respect of this operation. 
2. The aim of the operation is to restore law and order throughout the Province by making sure that there are no areas in which the Security Forces (normally)operate. 
3. The first step in this process is to introduce a strong military presence into those areas, which have recently been dominated by the IRA; and as seen as possible thereafter to ensure that there are no obstacles to free movement of any kind in any area in the Province, other than those required by the Security Forces for the purposes of security; and finally gradually to track down and pick up arms, ammunition, explosives and the active terrorists themselves. 
4. It must be made clear to all under your command that it is of vital importance that, in pursuit of your objectives, they should do all they can not only to avoid antagonising those who are not directly supporting the IRA but if possible to isolate the IRA from support by the population at large. This will not be easy, but it is of the greatest importance if the aim of the operation is to be achieved, both in the short and the long term. 
5. An essential element in this is that there should be no departure from the overriding principle that only the minimum force necessary to achieve the immediate aim should be used, and that the acts of individual soldiers, as of the Army at large should be seen to be in support of law and order. the must therefore be within the law. Commanders at all levels, in deciding the degree of force which is to be used, must bear in mind the importance of minimising the risk of casualties among innocent civilians and of damage to their property, as well as the risks to their own soldiers. 
6. The Secretary of State for Defence is fully confident that all under your command will conduct themselves with the discipline, restraint courage and skill which has been so conspicuous a hallmark of the Army in Northern Ireland over the last three years.

6. On military grounds the Army would prefer a simultaneous operation 
in Londonderry and Belfast, even though this would mean a delay of a further 48 hours. 
They believe that the resistance, both physical 
and other, to occupation of Andersonstown/Ballymurphy would in this event be less. 
There is no doubt that the operation in Londonderry 
will rouse great passions which are bound to be reflected in Belfast. They also believe that occupation of Andersonstown/Ballymurphy is essential if IRA intimidation of these areas and of the other Catholic areas in Belfast is ever to be seriously reduced. 
Although the 
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is ready to agree to raising the force level to the 27 battalions required to do this, he is not yet convinced that it is the right policy to do so and wishes to await the reaction to the Londonderry operation before authorising the Army to enter and occupy Andersonstown/Ballymurphy. 
7. Whether it is decided that the Bogside/Creggan should be occupied 
first or that there should be a simultaneous operation in Londonderry and Belfast, an explanation will have to be given on 27th July for the despatch of 7 battalions to Northern Ireland at the end of a week in which (unless the situation changes) the level of IRA activity has been very low. 
It appears that the only tenable line to take is that HMG 
have decided that it is essential to remove IRA terrorism and intimidation from the areas in which they are based, if there is to be any hope of political progress. 
strong military presence is required in these areas. 
HMG have therefore decided that a There will 
therefore be a clear inference that we are about to grasp the nettle of Londonderry. 
In spite of the considerable disadvantages of then

DIRECTIVE ON INTERROGATION The N.I.O. representatives reported that the latest versions of the 
document on arrest policy and of the directive on interrogation procedure had been sent to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. They would be issued, subject to his approval. OPERATIONS 2. 
The situation had remained relatively quiet since Operation Motorman. 
The most significant point of note was the campaign to remove the Army from schools in the former no-go areas. The R.E’s were at work on providing new accommodation for the Army. INTELLIGENCE 3. 
The IRA appeared to be directing their campaign against border areas 
and the Security Forces. This was in line with their attempts to win back the support of the Catholic population. Newspaper reports of IRA connection with other terrorist organisations, though having a certain amount of truth, were probably much exaggerated. 4.

5. THE ’IRISH TIMES’ ARTICLE REFERRED TO IN DUBLIN TEL 562 A FAIRLY ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF THE CASE PUT FORWARD BY THE THEY ARGUED THAT INTERNMENT INTRODUCED BY THE 
FAULKNER GOVERNMENT AND APPLIED ONLY AGAINST CATHOLICS WAS A VERY EMOTIVE ISSUE FOR CATHOLICS AS A WHOLE, THAT CATHOLIC EXTREMISTS WOULD EXPLOIT IT TO TURN THE CATHOLICS AGAIN AGAINST THE ARMY, AND THAT UNTIL IT WAS ENDED A SECURITY SITUATION COULD NOT BE ADMIRED WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE ARMY FORCE LEVELS TO BE REDUCED TO NORMAL. 
THEY AGREED 
THAT EVEN IF IT WAS ENDED, CATHOLIC EXTREMISTS WOULD FIND SOME OTHER ISSUE TO EXPLOIT: BUT THEY CONTENDED THAT NO OTHER ISSUE WOULD ATTRACT SUCH SYMPATHY OR BE AS EFFECTIVE AS THAT OF INTERNMENT. 
QUICKLY, IT WOULD BE SEEN TO HAVE BEEN ENDED BECAUSE OF THE MERITS OF THE CASE FOR ENDING IT AND AS A RESULT OF REPRESENTATIONS BY POLITICIANS: BUT IF IT WAS ENDED LATER, VIOLENCE AND COUNTER-VIOLENCE WOULD MEANWHILE HAVE GROWN AGAIN AND INTERNMENT WOULD APPARENTLY HAVE BEEN ENDED IN RESPONSE TO VIOLENCE: THIS WOULD STRENGTHEN THE POSITION OF THOSE SUCH AS THE IRA WHO SAID THAT THE BRITISH RESPONDED ONLY TO VIOLENCE.

also had evidence that some of those previously in internMent had returned to terrorism, and he was criticised for the resultant deaths. Some of those still in internment were dedicated to the most extreme forms of violence. 
lie accepted that the SDLP would 
publicly need to emphasise that they had demanded from him the immediate end of internment. 
The other members of the SDLP strongly supported Mr Fitt’s demand for an immediate end to internment. They advanced the following main arguments: 
a. They accepted that the aim of the Secretary of State was to 
achieve a political settlement. The SDP also wanted the reestablishment of politics. But for 50 years in Northern Ireland Opposition politicians had been ignored. The Provisional IRA had met the Secretary of State because violence had succeeded. The UDA were trying to adopt a similar course in demonstrating the success of violence. 
Political discussions had to produce clear 
results; if they did not do so quickly there would, particularly in the week of the first anniversary of internment and the Apprentice boys parade in Londonderry, be further resort to violence and disorder. It was misleading for the Secretary of State to talk of dancing to the SDLP’s tune. They wanted a political response to a political initiative, the case for which was in their view unchallengeable. 
b. In view of the overwhelming numbers of troops in Northern 
Ireland there was no longer justification on security grounds for the continuation of internment. Those in internment had been there for up to 12 months and were not therefore responsible for the most violent acts of terrorism which had since taken place. 
C. The ending of internment was not a concession, but the putting 
right of an injustice. d. 
The Provisionals were now in a state of disarray. Persons 
released from internment were primarily interested in returning to their families. Many of them in fact had a grievance against the Provisional IRA. In any event they could not return to violence unless they regained the support of the minority community. This could not be done if internment, the one outstanding major

Concerned had since been charged. k. 
1. 
The Republican Clubs and Sinn Fein should be made legal. The Oath or Allegiance caused resentment and was entirely 
unnecessary for the large number of public employees to whom it applied. If it were not changed before the local government elections few people would be prepared to stand. 
m. They were still concerned about the number of licensed 
weapons. The number of licences and gun clubs had dramatically increased in recent months. The Secretary of State should bear in mind that the clubs were a source of weapons for the UDR and the UVF. Shotguns were totally unnecessary in urban areas. Onethird of all deaths in Northern Ireland since the introduction of direct rule had been caused by Protestant extremists. 
n. Positive action should be taken to prevent the wearing of para-military uniforms. 
The Secretary of State said that he would consider n consultation with the Secretary of State for Defence whether there would be advantage in a meeting between Lord Carrington and the SDLP. He was fully aware of the need to maintain the support of the minority community.. He was surprised at the allegation that the background briefing for new Army units was biased since he had personally approved it and was satisfied that it was impartial. He would conult the GOC about the alleged difference in Army attitude and behaviour in Londonderry and Belfast and about the other specific complaints against the Army. The Army would vacate schools and other premises where the security situation allowed them to do so. If the SDLP had further complaints about the Army, it would be helpful if they would raise them with the local Commanders in the first instance, although he was of course available where necessa ry. He was aware of the case for legalising the Republican Clubs; legalising Sinn Fein would be more difficult. On the question of the Oath of Allegiance he would consider the general point; he had already decided that it should be excluded from Northern Ireland legislation passed at Westminster. He was considering what action should be taken in relation to licensed weapons and arms dealers, but he did not accept that the number of shotguns was unreasonable

There is no reason to disbelieve the Provisional IRA 
announcement that they intend to continue with guerilla activities. A major requirement of this must be to regain Catholic support, probably by propaganda or attempting to provoke the Security Forces into over-reaction. Attempts to sustain sectarian tension is another likely tactic. A continuation of car bomb attacks which can be mounted from their temporary bases must also be expected. 
5. Despite pressures from some of their own elements, the Official 
IRA is likely to maintain the ceasefire and to continue to lobby for participation in political talks through the Republic Clubs. Demonstrations can always be mounted through NICRA, in which it has a controlling element. 
6. Protestant reactions after Operation MOTORMAN are likely to 
be more relaxed and designed not to interfere with the Security Forces. The possibility exists that sectarian assassinations by small groups of extremists may continue, but that the leadership of the main Protestant organisations will attempt to curb this activity in their own interests.

Dated 21 July 1972 
HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY DATED 2 AUGUST 1972 UPDATING AS AT 0800 HRS FRIDAY 4 AUGUST 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
Phase II of Operation MOTORMAN is now well under way moving gradually 
into Phase III with searches and RUC/RMP patrols evident in all hard previously IRA dominated areas. Searches have also taken place in Protestant enclaves and though arrests in both communities have been selective, restricted to those on which there is good intelligence, nevertheless subsequent finds have been considerable. Since the operation, Londonderry has remained entirely quiet though in Belfast the number of incidents are increasing daily which suggests that the gunmen remained in Belfast and are beginning now to recover their weapons from hiding. Over the last two days there have been 46 shooting incidents and 7 bomb attacks throughout the Province. Activity in the border areas has increased with explosions at Brookborough, Newry, Belleek and Strabane and shooting incidents in Rosslea and Belleek and elsewhere. 
2. There is evidence that the Provisionals have initiated a propaganda 
campaign to seize the initiative from the Security Forces but in almost every case hostile comment has been either preempted or countered by careful presentation of the facts by the informatin agencies. 
3. On the political front SDLP who are due to meet the Secretary of State 
next week appealed yesterday for restraint whilst political action continues "We are fully concious that political action is the only solution to the present impasse". Mr Heath is reported to have told the Irish Ambassador that though grateful for all the help that Mr Lynch could give towards a settlement the problem remained essentially one for the people of the North and that therefore there was little sign of HMG relaxing its opposition to the Republic joining Mr Whitelaw’s conference on the future of the North. The victory of the Fianna Fail candidate in the Mid-Cork by election (20, 214 votes) was described as a complete endorsement of Mr Lynch’s policies on the Northern situation and on indication that the people of the 26 counties were entirely opposed to the violence carried out in the North by the IRA. Had Fianna Fail lost this pro-Government constituency there was every likelihood of a general election. 
3 Infantry Brigade 4. 
On Wednesday one UDR soldier was critically injured and three others 
were treated for shock and cuts when a terrorist claymore exploded beside their Shorland armoured car. Wires leading from the scene led to a point just inside the North where a car battery was found. The Gardai later found a mini close by without a car battery, there investigations continue. A policeman and six people were hospitalised with slight injuries after a car bomb exploded last night near an Army post in Newry. Earlier a 150 lb car bomb had caused extensive damage in Brookborough. Warnings were given in both cases. There have been a number of finds in selective searches including a small find yesterday at the UDA Headquarters in Portadown.

The Prime Minister said that there were two questions: 
whether we could have a settlement in Northern Ireland, and whether we could have a settlement with public involvement of the Government of the Republic. 
The important thing was to achieve a settlement. The Irish 
Government’s involvement need not be public, if that was likely to militate against a settlement. 
The Ambassador said that there were fears in the 
Republic that, because policy on Northern Ireland was bi-partisan at Westminster, matters would be settled without involving the Republic. 
The Prime Minister 
would find Mr. Lynch in close agreement with him; and Mr. Lynch would be in a position both to exert influence on the minority in Northern Ireland and to take a stern line with I.R.A. terrorists who moved into the Republic. He would wish to be as helpful as he could. 
But the 
British Government must remember that Mr. Lynch himself was faced with a difficult political problem; and that, 
if he were to lose a General Election, the alternative Government would be a combination of parties with divided views.

administration in the North whose main purpose must be to reconcile the communities there and of moving on to long-term solutions as the opportunities present themselves. 
My Government are fully prepared to play a constructive role in this. My immediate purpose in this message is to urge most strongly on you the importance of ensuring that yesterday’s military activities are followed promptly by political actions and decisions designed to restore confidence among the minority. These must assure them unequivocally that there is no question whatever of their being returned to the control of a sectarian administration or of the R.U.C. as at present constituted. The question of the future policing of minority areas is a matter appropriate to political discussions. 
Now that you have demonstrated your determination and military capacity in regard to extremists on one side there is no reason for not facing up to extremists, such as the Ulster Defence Association, on the other, including the taking up of licensed as well as unlicensed weapons, especially in Belfast where about thirty individual cases of sectarian assassination occurred in the month of July.

2nd August, 1972 18/2/28 The Attorney General has now considered Sir William 
Nield’s paper on preventive detention for terrorist conduct, to which you referred in your Minute of the 31st July. 
The Attorney has noted that the paper rejects any 
suggestion of the creation of a new criminal offence capable of trial within the jurisdiction of the ordinary criminal courts. It envisages rather that persons against whom there is insufficient evidence to secure a conviction under the criminal law (including the Special Powers Act provisions) should nevertheless be detained if their conduct has involved them in "complicity in any degree with terrorism generally". The ordinary rules of evidence will not be applied and the normal rights of an accused person in the criminal courts will not be available to him. A decision on whether a person is "guilty" would be made by persons acting on hearsay in the exercise of their discretion. In effect, this would be a substitution of the administrative decision of (now) the Secretary of State by the decision of a committee. 
In these circumstances the Attorney regards it as 
wholly inappropriate to describe the body which is to impose preventive detention as "a court", or to speak of a case being proved against the accused. The Detention Order would depend on the arbitrary decision of this committee which would presumably not be required to state the grounds of their decision. Thus any system of appeal to the High Court would be very difficult if not impossible. 
Such committees (which could be described as tribunals) 
would accordingly be acting under no presently acceptable process of law; they would not be within the tradition of the courts and could hardly be manned by judges whose constitutional duties would make them wholly inappropriate to operate the proposed system. Clearly the Lord Chancellor would have to be consulted if there was any question of judges manning such tribunals.

The Attorney minutes that even in 1940 in the 
United Kingdom there were courts (admittely sitting in camera) which administered the criminal law (e.g., in the cases of spies); and a wholly separate administrative procedure whereby, on the authority of a Minister, persons suspected of disaffection were detained under Regulation 18B. 
The "special courts" now operating in the Republic 
are in fact courts, and they proceed under the rule of law and the rules of evidence. They dispense however with the need for a jury and are manned by selected judges. The reason, apparently, for these courts is: 
(a) lack of confidence in some of their judges, and (b) lack of confidence in their juries. 
Neither of these conditions prevail in Northern Ireland. Some of the process of the special courts in the Republic is in camera, but counsel and solicitors for the accused remain in court and the burden of proof and the rules of evidence remain. 
In the opinion of the Attorney General it would be 
possible to provide by legislation for the establishment of a procedure whereby persons would be subject to preventive detention on the exercise of the discretion of a tribunal which was satisfied that the persons brought before it had been concerned with terrorism. There could also be provided an appeal from such a tribunal to an appellate tribunal, but the creation of such a system for the imposition of preventive detention would require an Act of Parliament. 
I am copying this letter to the recipients of yours 
Minute, and to Kenneth Jones (Home Office), Neil Cairncross (Northern Ireland Office) and Arthur Hockaday (Cabinet Office).

PRIME MINISTER BY THE POPE. 
BEGINS. WE HAVE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE WHICH YOUR EXCELLENCY KINDLY SENT ON JULY 30TH LAST TO INFORM US ABOUT THE EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES WHICH HAVE BEEN DECIDED ON BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO PREVENT THE REPETITION IN NORTHERN IRELAND OF THE LAMENTABLE ACTS OF TERRORISM WHICH HAVE SO SHOCKED PUBLIC OPINION AND SO SADDENED US IN THESE DAYS. 
YOU HAVE ALSO ASSURED US OF THE 
UNALTERED DETERMINATION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO WORK FORPEACE AND RECONCILIATION BETWEEN ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE PROVINCE. 
IN THANKING YOUR EXCELLENCY FOR YOUR COURTESY, WE WOULD LIKE 
TO EXPRESS OUR GREAT HOPE AND CONFIDENCE THAT, IN CARRYING OUT THESE MEASURES; EVERY CARE WILL BE TAKEN TO AVOID ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF FURTHER EMBITTERING ATTIDUDES AND WIDENING THE CONTRASTS AND THE DIVISIONS. 
WE REFER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL, 
WHICH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, HAVING ASSUMED DIRECT RULE IN NORTHERN IRELAND, NOTICEABLY ATTENUATED, UNDERSTANDING WELL THE DEEP RESENTMENT WHICH THE MEASURE CAUSED IN ONE SECTION OF THE POPULATION, AND THE GRAVE HARDSHIP WHICH IT CAUSED TO INDIVIDUALS AND TO FAMILIES. 
WHILE WE ONCE AGAIN DEPLORE THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO OBTAIN 
THE RECOGNITION AND DUE RESPECT FOR PEOPLE’S RIGHTS, WE ENCOURAGE THE EFFORTS OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND OF ALL MEN OF GOOD WILL AIMED AT ELIMINATING THE DEEP CAUSES OF A SOCIAL AND CIVIL MALAISE WHICH HINDERS THE PACIFICATION OF MINDS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HARMONIOUS RELATIONS AMONG THE PEOPLE.

Note of a meeting at 12 noon on 1 August OPERATIONS Patrolling, mostly by the Army and RUC jointly, is being increased in the 
areas occupied on Monday, and observation posts are being established, About three barricades are still standing, all in Londnderry, but they should have been removed in the next twenty-four hours. Most of those arrested have been arrested with a view to criminal charges being preferred. Of the two people milled in Londonderry one was a suspected gunman, the other a suspected patrol bomber. There have been some useful arms finds. The Ulster Defense Regiment is performing its usual tanks, such as checking vehicles in rUral areas. 
INTELLIGENCE 2. 
The whereabouts of leading members of the IRA are unknown. It if possible 
that those from Londonderry have crossed the border but that the Belfast members have gone to ground in Northern Ireland. 3. 
Most questioning of people arrested so far has been with a view to charges 
being preferred. Matters arising out of the possible interrogation of suspects for intelligence purposes are still being considered in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office will keep the Ministry of Defence informed of developments. 4. 
The Roman Catholic community would be reassured if it seemed that Protestant 
extremists were being dealt with. In this connection it would be espcially useful if people responsible for the recent sectarian killings were arrested and charged. But even then, it would inevitably take some time to secure a conviction. INFORMATION POLICY 5. 
A news-sheet called "Bloody Friday" has been printed for distribution by 
the Northern Ireland Office, the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Central Office of Information. It contains newspaper comments and photographs. Its object is to sustain the feelings of revulsion from the Provisional IRA. 
6. It may be possible to publicise new efforts to improve civic amenities, 
especially in Londonderry. 7. 
Diplomatic missions abroad have received plenty of briefing material on 
the latest events but further guidance may be necessary before the end of this week. The bye-election in Cork takes place on 2 August.

Reference: A. 
1. A/BR/30/1/M04 dated 20 September 1972. Headquarters Northern Ireland weekly operational summary for 
the week ending 20 September 1972 was circulated under Reference A. An updating of the summary up to 0800 hrs Friday 22 September is attached at Annex A.

issued seperately. OUTLOOK 4. 
22 SEPTEMBER 1972 The outlook remains as for last week. As the date for the Secretary 
of State’s conference approaches so extremist groups must be expected to demonstrate their ability to influence events in the Province and thus point up their non-participation at the conference. 
5. There are indications that the Provisional IRA are becoming increasingly 
isolated and demoralised by security force domination; however, it requires only a few determined terrorists to carry out an action designed to show that without their participation the conference cannot be expected to succeed.

are expected to continue to try to exert their influence in the Provisional areas of Belfast.

ON SECURITY POLICY 
HM Government it clear, on assuming direct responsibility for the government of Northern Ireland, t hat it was their objective to bring internment under the Special Powers Act to as soon as the security situation permitted; and to 
consider how far the powers conferred under that Act could be dispensed with. 
to use 
HM Government reaffirm these objectives and their determination the processes of law to the fullest possible extent in 
dealing with terrorism. In pursuit of those objectives, since 30 
March 1972, 724 persons have been released from internment 
or detention; 171 persons are still interned and 70 persons are held in detention. During the same period, the law 
enforcement authorities, acting vigorously under the ordinary processes of the criminal law, have achieved considerable success and well over 300 persons have been charged with offences connected with terrorist activities. 
Nevertheless, certain basic problems of countering terrorism 
by the normal processes of law still present difficulties. These include the problem of preventing the intimidation of Witnesses who may be in danger of their lives if they give evidence in court; and of bringing to trial many of those who, although responsible for organising and directing terrorism, take care to avoid so far as possible themselves engaging in terrorist operations. The system of internment cannot be ended without putting something in its place. This does not mean, however, that there cannot be changes.

The Government therefore propose to set up at an early date a commission of experienced lawyers and laymen to advise them on the measures required to deal with terrorist organisations and to bring to book individuals involved in terrorist activities without the necessity to resort to powers of internment; and, in the light of the commission’s report, to prepare substantive legislation to that end. 
The Government reaffirm their determination to improve the security situation in Northern Ireland and to deal with terrorists, including those who, for the reasons indicated earlier, cannot be dealt with through the normal processes of the criminal law. Pending the report of the commission and the subsequent legislation on it, the Government propose to make changes to strengthen the existing law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for membership of unlawful associations. In addition, they intend at an early date to introduce provisions under the Special Powers Act to set up a tribunal to deal with persons suspected of participation in terrorist activities by means of a procedure which will provide maximum safeguards for the protection of the individual and will eliminate the objectionable features of internment, notably judgment by executive decision alone, but which will be matched to the special conditions which unfortunately obtain in Northern Ireland. This tribunal will be asked to consider cases referred to it (which will include cases of those presently in internment or detention) to determine the nature of their involvement in terrorist activities with a view to their release or committal to a period of detention. This procedure is very different from internment. 
The details of these proposals will be explained when the necessary measures are laid before Parliament. But the Government wish to make clear at once that these measures will not in any way be directed against the holding of opinions, but against the use, or encouragement, of violence and terror to force those opinions on law abiding citizens. These interim provisions will be employed only where the ordinary processes of the criminal law are inadequate and will be enforced with complete impartiality against whatever persons or organisations are found to be engaged in terrorism and violence.

On assuming direct responsibility for the government of Northern Ireland,

possible for the Government to carry through its intention of abolishing internment, or to begin the process of dismantling the Special Powers Act. The Government therefore proposes to set up at an 
early date a mixed commission of experienced jurists and laymen to advise how best the activities of terrorist organisations may be dealt with and individuals involved in those activities brought to book without the necessity to resort to powers of internment, and in the light of the commission’s report to prepare substantive legislation to that end. Meantime, the Government reaffirms its determination to 
improve the security situation in Northern Ireland and to deal with terrorists, including those who, for the reasons indicated earlier, cannot easily be dealt with through the normal processes of the criminal law. 
Pending the report of the commission and of 
the subsequent legislation on it, the Government therefore proposes at an early date to introduce interim legislation under the Special Powers Act to set up a special tribunal to deal with persons accused of terrorist activities by means of a procedure which will preserve the essentials of natural justice, but which will be matched to the special conditions which unfortunately obtain in Northern Ireland. 
This tribunal will be asked to 
consider cases referred to it by the Secretary of State (which will include cases of those presently in internment), to determine the nature of their involvement in terrorist activities, and either to order release or to impose a definite period of detention. The details of these proposals will be explained when the necessary measures are laid before Parliament.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 080700 to 110700 HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 
GENERAL 
1. After the Shankill confrontation on Thursday and the march to Tennent Street RUC station by 350 workers from Harland and Wolff on Friday, the wekend turned out to be relatively quiet, considering the potentially explosive situation. For the second successive weekend the level of violence was higher on Sat/Sun (approx 40 shooting incidents - 31 of them in Belfast 
- and 1 explosion) compared with Fri/Sat (24 shootings 
3 explosions) and Sun/Mon (20 shootings 2 explosions). Casualties totalled 3 soldiers killed and 9 wounded; 1 RUC wounded; 3 civilians injured, and 1 terrorist claimed hit. BELFAST saw most of the action. LONDONDERRY was very quiet except for one bomb explosion (30 lbs) which destroyed a cafe. In the countryside, a Northern Resistence Movement meeting was held on Saturday in Armagh, at which the speakers approved the Black September actions in Munich amongst other things and it ended with 39 batons having to be fired to disperse the crowd. 27 Borstal Boys rioted in Armagh Jail. Near Dungannon a 300-400 lb claymore typo device was command detonated on 
70 yards away. It killed 2 and wounded 3 A & SH soldiers in a Saracen. One of the wounded subsequently died. On the border the newly built Customs post at Auchnacloy was destroyed again. In GB weekend press comment concentrated on the deterioration in relations between the Protestant community and the Army in general and 1 PARA in particular. The News of the World had banner headlines concerning an autumn IRA bombing campaign in GB. The Sunday Telegraph carried a revealing biography of John Stephenson. 
Monday night from a dead ground position 2. During Fri/Sat 8/9 Sep 72. It was quiet in Ulster’ except in Belfast 
where a march of about 350 workers from Harland and Wolff to the Tennent St RUC station had all the makings of a possible serious disturbance. However after speeches from Mr Faulkner and other Protestant leaders the crowd dispersed and all was peaceful at 1500 hours. SF were involved in 18 of 24 shooting incidents, in one of these LCPL Taylor, 3 RGJ sustained a minor wound. In the rural areas there were 3 bomb explosions, one extensively damaged the newly built Customs Post at Aughnacloy. Later a claymore mine exploded when a patrol was searching the area.

the House went into recess on 11th August operations by the security forces against the terrorists in Northern Ireland have been maintained at a high level. 
In the 
period between Operation Motorman on 31st July and 8th September 127 persons have been brought before the Courts and charged with offences related to terrorist activities. 
Arms finds 
have included 70 machine guns, 150 rifles, 108 pistols, 24,500 rounds of ammunition and approximately 71/2 tons of explosives. 
There has in recent weeks been a reduction in 
the number of bombing incidents,although the security forces continue to suffer casualties from bombing and sniping attacks made directly on them. 
But action against terrorism is not enough by itself 
and at the same time HMG have pressed ahead with the preparations for a conference between 25th-27th September which will discuss the future constitutional arrangements for the Province. At this conference the political parties in Northern Ireland represented at Stormont will have the opportunity to express their considered views on the future of Northern Ireland. HMG is encouraged by the preparation, and publication, of

proposals by some of the parties. In addition, HMG have 
invited, and received, a number of comments from other persons or organisations. 
It is the Government’s intention to give 
the most careful examination to all of these comments and proposals. 
Political progress is, however, threatened by incidents 
such as that which occurred last Thursday in the Shankill area of Belfast in which a mobile patrol was confronted with a riotous crowd. 
which two persons lost their lives. 
The incident led to an exchange of fire in The circumstances of 
this incident are being investigated by the Police with the full co-operation of the Service authorities and the conclusions will be reported to the Secretary of State. 
It is clear that 
incidents of this kind cannot do other than impede and obstruct progress towards the restoration of peaceful conditions in Northern Ireland. 
H. M. Government well understand the impact of three 
years of violence and terrorism and the natural anxiety of people to protect themselves. 
If, however, the people of 
Northern Ireland who have suffered so much want to see the emergence of an orderly society, they must appreciate that this cannot be achieved so long as extreme factions in both communities persist in provocative behaviour and sectarian violence in the streets. 
The people of Great Britain know 
and the people of Northern Ireland must realise it too - that the lot of British soldiers contending not only with sniping

Northern Ireland (GEN 79) 
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has circulated three memoranda - GEN 79(72) 18, on the political and constitutional future of 
Northern Ireland; GEN 79(72) 19, on a package of security measures and changes in the administration of justice; and GEN 79(72) 17, covering a report by officials on the legal aspects of possible measures to deal with terrorist organisations. 2. 
These three subjects are interlinked in that the suppression of 
terrorism is an indispensable ingredient of any political settlement for the Province. 
Nevertheless, you may think it convenient to take 
GEN 79(72) 18 first (since its subject matter is both more fundamental and less likely to raise immediate practical problems) and then to consider the two memoranda about our policy towards terrorist organisations. The Future of Northern Ireland 3. 
In GEN 79(72) 18, the Secretary of State proposes that, in view 
of the absence of any consensus among the Ulster interests themselves and the certainty that they would unite to oppose any solution which we put forward, we should let them have their say at the conference on 25th-27th September and should then produce a Green Paper setting out, for general consideration, the ideas which we consider right but can perhaps link, presentationally, with points emerging from the conference. 4. 
The Secretary of State also reverts to the projected plebiscite on 
the Border but admits that, in terms of legislative priority, it must take second place to his proposed legislation to establish special courts. 5. 
Finally, he indicates in Annex 1 the main elements of the 
constitutional settlement which he envisages at the end of direct rulei.e. the permanent abolition of Stormont, coupled with enlarged Northern Ireland representation in the Westminster Parliament, a "regional assembly" in Belfast and the transfer of the law and order function to the United Kingdom Government. He promises further memoranda elaborating these suggestions. 6. 
All of this seems sensible, particularly if publication of a Green Paper were linked with the implication in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 that 
Files\\EKG_round1\\PREM 15 1013\\IMG_8108_PREM_15_1013 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
(a) Ministers will have no difficulty in agreeing that we should continue, so far as possible, to use the normal courts to deal with terrorists. 
(b) 
This proposal involves amending Regulation 24.A. to make clear:(i) 
(ii) 
that the proscription of the Irish Republican Army includes the Provisional Wing as well as the Officials; 
that the offence of becoming or remaining a member of a proscribed organisation is extended to include professing to be a member of it or speaking on its behalf, and perhaps financing and fund-raising also. Moreover, any person who is present at a number of meetings of an unlawful association, or speaks on its behalf, will have to prove that he is not a member of it. 
Proposal (i) could be circumvented by changes of name (cf. a recent Intelligence report that the Officials were thinking of calling themselves the "Irish Revolutionary Army"). But there are reasons for not attempting to define a subversive organisation on the lines of Section 3 of the Canadian Act, since either it then becomes necessary to prove in every single case that the organisation in question satisfies the definition or we are in the dilemma of stating conditions which have to be satisfied while declaring arbitrarily that certain organisations satisfy them. Proposal (ii) admittedly reverses the normal onus of proof - i. e. it is incumbent on the defendant to establish his innocence instead of on the prosecution to establish his guilt. But this seems inherent in the nature of the case. 
(c) In favour of the proposal to introduce special courts or tribunals (which is also discussed in Appendix 1 to GEN 79(72) 17) it can be argued that we should in principle be substituting a judicial process for the executive machinery which at present governs internment and detention. But it will undoubtedly be politically controversial to introduce judicial processes different from those of the normal courts (although the Secretary of State deploys the counter arguments in paragraph 5 of the Annex to GEN 79(72) 19); and the Attorney General, who may well be

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
supported by the Lord Chancellor, is likely to emphasise the difficulty of associating judges with the kind of court described in paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to GEN 79(72) 17. 
If Ministers 
are convinced, however, that the introduction of special courts or tribunals would have a material impact in terms of convicting terrorists, the political price may be thought to be worth paying. But, if so, it will be necessary to find room for the necessary legislation; and some other item in the legislative programme may have to be sacrificed. 
(d) A statement of intention to end internment will have political merit both with the Opposition at Westminster and with the SDLP in Northern Ireland. As regards the "hard core" who cannot be released, the Secretary of State proposes that, pending the creation of the special courts, the individuals concerned should continue to be detained under Regulation 11, subject to review by a "special interim body". The Secretary of State recognises that this may be unacceptable to the SDLP, who may withdraw from the projected conference as a result. Since the conference is likely to be unproductive in any event, this price, too, may be thought worth paying. 
(e) To begin to dismantle the Special Powers Act will be politically popular. Paragraph 8 of the Annex to GEN 79(72) 19, however, envisages retaining for the time being those parts of the Act which confer powers on the security forces. These are presumably those relating to stopping and searching, etc; but do they also include the powers of arrest without warrant? 
(f) Given an intention to dispense with internment, there seems no alternative to the detention under Regulation 11 of persons arrested as terrorists until special courts or tribunals are introduced. As pointed out in paragraph 3 of Appendix 3 to GEN 79(72) 17, however, this will certainly be criticised as a disguised form of internment without the provision of the present Regulation 12 for representations to an advisory committee. How far will the proposed "special interim body" meet this criticism? 
10. The practical implications are:- 
(a) Immediate amendment of Regulation 24.A. by Order in Council under the urgency procedure. 
It will be necessary, when Parliament reassembles, to justify doing, in the Recess,

NOTE OF A MEETING IN LONDON AT 3 0’CLOCK ON 7 SEPTEMBER Those present were: 
Secretary of State Dr O’Sullivan Mr Stevens 
The Secretary of State explained that the reason for recent UDA and Tartan Gang activity was the arrest by security forces of a leading UDA member - Mr Doyle. He said that he thought terrorist activity generally seemed to be decreasing but he was most upset by the explosion this morning at Mr O’Kane’s house. The Secretary of State added that he had on Tuesday visited local security committees in Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh and that on Wednesday he had attended a lunch in Ballymoney. At all these country areas he had been pleased to note a relaxed atmosphere, although obviously in Border areas terrorist activity was still giving great cause for concern. 
The Secretary of State asked Dr O’Sullivan if he would report to Mr Lynch that HMG had no wish to remain in any Roman Catholic schools 
a 
or Casement Park. However, because of the security situation in certain areas it was necessary for the Army to maintain a presence but they were actively seeking alternative accommodation and in fact would be out of St Genevieve’s, all being well, in October. 
Dr O’Sullivan said that the reason Mr Lynch had asked him to call was because he was disturbed by the press briefing put out by HMG after his meeting with the Prime Minister. He explained that the briefing, or at least reports appearing in the newspapers, laid particular emphasis on the fact that the Prime Minister gave Mr Lynch a severe talking to about the Irish Government’s handling of the IRA. This had embarrassed Mr Lynch, especially since it was understood by his Ministry of Foreign Affairs that HMG would not use IRA activity south of the Border for propaganda purposes. 
The Secretary of State said that there had been 28 cross-Border raids by the IRA in the last month and this was obviously causing concern in the North and, no doubt, to Mr Lynch. He appreciated that there was some co-operation between Southern Irish security forces and the

4 SEPTEMBER 1972 
FOLLOWING FOR ARMSTRONG 10 DOWNING STREET FROM ROBERTS MR. LYNCH MET THE PRIME MINISTER FOR ONE AND A HALF HOURS 
THIS MORNING. IRISH AMBASSADOR TO WEST GERMANY (RONAN), MAITLAND AND I WERE PRESENT. LYNCH OPENED BY EXPRESSING APPRECIATION FOR WHAT HMG HAD DONE 
OR THE MINORITY IN THE NORTH OF IRELAND AND GOODWILL FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAD SUPPORTED OPERATION MOTORMAN. BUT THE MINORITY IN THE NORTH HAD A NUMBER OF GRIEVANCES WHICH THE PROVISIONALS COULD EXPLOIT SEMI COLON AND THE PROVISIONALS GAINED FROM THE WIDELY HELD VIEW THAT THE SECURITY FORCES WERE CONCENTRATING ON THE GHETTOS OF THE MINORITY AID LEAVING PROTESTANT EXTREMISTS ALONE. HE WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR AN INDICATION OF HMG’S LONGER TERM POLICIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE IMPENDING CONFERENCE.

THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT BY SUSPENDING STORMONT AND PUTTING 
THROUGH LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH DISCRIMINATION HMG HAD TAKEN FULLY EFFECTIVE STEPS TO SAFEGUARD THE POSITION OF THE MINORITY. 
IN DOING SO THEY HAD INCURRED CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION, PARTICULARLY FROM UNIONISTS: BUT NO ONE COULD NOW ARGUE THAT HMG WOULD NOT STAND UP TO PROTESTANT PRESSURES. NEVERTHELESS THERE WAS WIDESPREAD FEELING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM THAT THE IRA COULD HAVE BEEN QUICKLY SUPPRESSED IF THE REPUBLIC HAD TAKEN ACTION EARLIER. THE GREATER HELP NOW GIVEN OVER BORDER CONTROL WAS WELCOME. BUT UNITED KINGDOM OPINION COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE REPUBLIC DID NOT TAKE FURTHER ACTION, PARTICULARY IN VIEW OF THE STRONG POLITICAL POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC ISSUES WERE DSCUSSED: 
1. 
SEPTEMBER CONFERENCE LYNCH SAID THAT HE SUPPORTED THE CONFERENCE BUT HOPED THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO STRONGER SAFEGUARDS FOR THE MINORITY AND THE RETENTION OF POWER AT WESTMINSTER. HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD HOPE TO BE BROUGHT MORE CLOSELY INTO CONSULTATION. THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT IT WAS FOR THE NORTHERN IRELAND REPRESENTATIVES AT THE CONFERENCE TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT THEY WANTED. HE HOPED THAT THE MINORITY WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH A SINGLE VOICE. IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PRESS AHEAD RAPIDLY AFTER THE CONFERENCE SINCE THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR CARRYING NORTHERN IRELAND LEGISLATION BY ORDER IN COUNCIL WOULD 
REMAIN IN FORCE ONLY UNTIL NEXT MARCH. IT WOULD BE THE TASK OF A SENIOR FCO REPRESENTATIVE AT THE CONFERENCE AND OF HM AMBASSADOR IN DUBLIN TO KEEP LYNCH FULLY INFORMED OF PROGRESS. MEANWHILE IT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL IF BEFORE THE CONFERENCE LYNCH COULD MAKE A CONSTRUCTIVE SPEECH URGING BOTH SIDES TO COME TOGETHER. 
2. 
INTERNEES THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT SINCE OPERATION MOTORMAN WE HAD RELEASED A LARGE NUMBER OF INTERNEES AND HAD CHARGED 105 PERSONS. THE SDLP AND OTHERS WHO ARGUED THAT INTERNMENT SHOULD BE ENDED NEEDED TO EXPLAIN WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE HARD CORE LIKELY TO RETURN TO ACTIVE TERRORISM. WHEN LYNCH SUGGESTED THAT CONTINUING INTERNMENT WAS A HELP TO THE PROVISIONALS, THE PRIME MINISTER ARGUED THAT THERE WAS GOOD EVIDENCE, FOR EXAMPLE IN THE RECENT OBSERVER ARTICLE, THAT THE PROVISONALS WOULD CONTINUE SHOOTING EVEN IF INTERNMENT ENDED. 
3. CROSS -BORDER RAIDS 
THE PRIME MINISTER POINTED OUT THAT IN THE FIRST TWENTY EIGHT DAYS OF AUGUST THERE HAD BEEN TWENTY EIGHT INCIDENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO IRA CROSS-BORDER ACTIVITY. COULD NOT THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT TAKE MORE EFFECTIVE ACTION AGAINST TERRORISTS OPERATING ACROSS THE BORDER? LYNCH REPLIED

9. 
CASEMENT PARK MR. LYNCH ARGUED AT SOME LENGTH THAT THE ARMY SHOULD LEAVE CASEMENT PARK, WHOSE CONTINUING OCCUPATION WAS AN EMOTIVE ISSUE WHICH THE PROVISONALS WOULD TRY TO EXPLOIT. IT WAS NOT TRUE THAT THE PARK WAS IN A COMMANDING POSITION. A NEARBY RUGBY PITCH PROVIDED A BETTER ALL-ROUND VIEW, BUT THIS HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN OVER. THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR THE ARMY TO BE BASED WHERE THEY COULD OPERATE MOST EFFECTIVELY AGAINST TERRORISM. WHY COULD NOT THE GAELIC ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION (AND PERHAPS ALSO LYNCH HIMSELF IN THE DAIL) SAY THAT THE SOONER GUNMEN WERE OUT OF THE AREA THE SOONER THE STADIUM WOULD BE RETURNED TO SPORTSMEN? LYNCH SAID THAT HE WOULD PUT THIS POINT TO THE GAELIC ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION. 
TAKING A PRECISE VIEW. HIS GOVERNMENT SAW SOME MERIT IN LOCATING THE POLITICAL SECRETARIAT IN BRUSSELS BECAUSE THEY LIKED DECENTRALISATION: BUT THEY DID NOT FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT IT. THE PRIME MINISTER SET OUT THE POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF LOCATING THE SECRETARIAT IN BRUSSELS, WHICH WAS NOT THE CAPITAL OF A MAJOR EUROPEAN POWER AND WHERE THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND OTHER EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS ALREADY MET. 
TWO OTHER MATTERS LESS DIRECTLY RELATED TO NORTHERN IRELAND 
WERE DISCUSSED. THE PRIME MINISTER DESCRIBED THE PROBLEMS OF THE USANDAN ASIANS, AND POINTED OUT THAT HMG WOULD BE UNDER PRESSURE TO TAKE ACTION ON CITIZENSHIP. THIS WOULD RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE coMMON TRAVEL AREA BETWEEN BRITAIN AND IRELAND, AND THE VOTING AND OTHER RIGHTS ENJOYED BY THE IRISH IN BRITAIN. THIS ARGUMENT HAD CLEARLY NOT STRUCK MR. LYNCH BEFORE: IN REPLY HE SAID NO MORE THAN THAT HE WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT LEGISLATION AFFECTING RISH CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS IN BRITAIN. DURING A SHORT DISCUSSION OF EUROPEAN ISSUES, MR. LYNCH SAID 
THAT HE WOULD IN PRINCIPLE LIKE TO SEE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS STRENGTHENED, BUT WOULD WANT SOME EXPERIENCE OF THEM BEFORE

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 01070 TO 1. explosions) and 040700 SEPTEMBER 72 
GENERAL. The level of violence was low on Fri/Sat (18 shootings 4 Sun/Mon (16 shootings 2 explosions) but higher than usual on 
Sat/Sun (55 shootings 38 in Belfast nil explosions). In all one soldier was killed (accidentally); three soldiers and one RUC constable were wounded; and six civilains were hurt. In Belfast at 0410 hrs on Sunday morning two patrols met in 40 Cdr area (NEW LODGE) and engaged one another accidentally. Gnr CUTTING (7 Bty RA att 40 Cdc) was killed and one gunner and one marine were wounded. On Sunday afternnon in Andersonstown both Catholic civil rights movements supported by a number of parents and teachers, in all about 400, demonstrated against continued use by Security Forces of Catholic schools. (Term begins again today 4 Sep). Londonderry was quiet, as was the border. In the countryside, there were a few assorted incidents, mostly in Portadown. In Great Britain, weekend press comment featured the disclosures of the Provisional defector Maria McGuire, whose position in law is unclear 
- she 
is reportedly wanted by Interpol in connection with the attempt to fly Czech arms through Amsterdam on 16 Oct 1971. The main points she made were that there is a power struggle within the Provisional leadership, who are under pressure to call off the bombing compaign that 
real power resides in the hands of 
Stephenson ( a bigoted murderer) in Dublin, and Twomey in Belfast, where the dynamic for the whole campaign exists; that anger among Northern Catholics in general has been growing because of the political sterility of a purely terrorist policy; and that the IRA must call a cease fire and talk, while HMG must realise that the IRA must have a place at some ultimate conference table. In the Republic, tho Provisionals issued a statement dismissing the allegations made in England by Maria McGuire, claiming that she was of no consequence in the organisation and knew little of significance. 
Elsewhere, Mr Heath meets Mr Lynch today 4 Sep in Munich at the Olympic Games. 2. During FRI/SAT 1/2 SEP 72 the Province was quiet. There were 17 shooting 
incidents of which 14 involved the Security Forces. A Corporal in 40 Cdo was wounded in the leg by gunfire. There was one explosion, and ATO detonated 3 devices. There was a spate of arson in Portadown, thought to be an attempt by Protestants to set up an intersectarian clash. 
3. During SAT/SUN 2/3 SEP 72 there was a marked increase in shooting and in 
Belfast the level was the highest since Motorman. However there were no explosions, although there was a spate of incendiary attacks against Protestant owned shops in Ballymena. In an incident in Belfast 2 patrols mistook each other for gunmen and exchanged fire; one soldier was killed and two wounded. Elsewhere two soldiers, and an RUC constable were wounded one of whom was on leave. Four civilians were wounded and 4 hits were claimed. 
4. During SUN/MON 3/4 SEP 72 there were fewer incidents than the day before. 
There were 16 shooting incidents of which Security Forces were involved in 12. There were two explosions.

NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NOON ON 13 OCTOBER 
Sir William Nield reported progress on: (i) 
The "Green Paper" be 
The paper would go to Cabinet on 17 October and (barring accidents)/published on 30 October. It would not be called a " 
" but a "paper for discussion". (ii) 
The Diplock Commission Names of the 3 members serving on the Commission would be announced shortly. 
(iii) Tribunals 
Four chairmen had been appointed. It would be unwise to appoint laymen to the tribunals in view of the assassination attempt on Mr Staunton. 
2. Border Security 
Ministers had decided not to resume cratering on the border. The Army had been asked to do a study of the increased use of ramps. This would be included in the study on border security to be undertaken by Lt Col Nevill. 
3. Protestant Extremists 
The risk of militant Protestant activity over the coning weekend was discussed, And in particular the danger of the UVF operating under the cover of UDA offers of assistance to the Army in controlling Tartans. It was agreed that the Secretary of State should be alerted to the risks of Protestant activity over the weekend. 
The next NIOM will be held at noon on Tuestay 17 October in Conference Room "B". The meeting on Friday 20 October will be held in Room 35 (on the same floor).

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR TILE PERIOD 060700 HOURS TO 090700 HOURS OCTOBER 1972 
1. The weekends violence followed the usual pattern of a more active 
Friday with quieter Saturday and Sunday. However there were less shooting incidents (77) than in recent weekends (130 last weekend). On the other hand there were 12 bombings compared with 7 last weekend causing 1 civilian killed and 16 injured. Another bomb in the Lower Falls had the appearance of a Protestant attack. Several useful arrests were made and there were 6 hits on terrorists (including 1 killed). The Civil Rights anniversary rally in Londonderry passed off uneventfully but later minor stoning and hooliganism took place. There were several incidents of UDR weapons being stolen and one UDR man was abducted temporarily. 
2. During Fri/Sat (6/7 Oct). There was an increase in shooting incidents (35) in Belfast and one gunman was shot dead. There were no SF casualties but 2 other hits were claimed. An explosion caused extensive damage to a Youth Club in Mullhouse St (Falls). A number of arrests were made including 2 officers and 4 volunteers of the Provisional IRA. Londonderry was extremely quiet; there were no shooting incidents and only sporadic stoning in the Shantallow area. A 150 lb bomb caused extensive damage in Ballymena. A UDR soldier was abducted in Newry and in 3 separate incidents, other UDR soldiers were robbed of a total of 3 rifles, a shotgun, an SMG and ammunition, a 9mm pistol and an air rifle. UDA members were active in Lurgan and Lisburn. 
3. During Sat/Sun (7/8 Oct). The number of shooting incidents in Belfast dropped to 13 but an explosion in Leeson St (Falls) killed a 22 year old woman and injured 14 other civilians 
a 9 year old girl is VSI. There was 
increased holiganism by Protestant youths in E Belfast. Londonderry had another quiet day though a soldier was wounded in one of the two shooting incidents in the Bogside. A Protestant youth (20) was shot dead in Newtown Stewart by a UDR patrol, after a bombing incident. 15 shots were fired at a SF patrol on Armagh and 5 rounds were returned; there were no casualties. There were 3 explosions in the rural area.

NOTE OF A MEETING AT NOON ON 6 OCTOBER 1972 1. The Chairman reported the general conclusions reached by Ministers that morn- 
ing on the timing of possible political developments and other matters, and said that work in the Northern Ireland Office on the setting up of tribunals and the Diplock Commission was proceeding urgently. 
2. The meeting discussed the possibility that the Sunday Times insight team might 
publish an article on the use of patrols in plain clothes by the Army. The informtion services have been working hard on countering IRA propaganda about "assassination squads" by making the facts available to the press. The line should be taken that it is natural and essential for the security forces to have recourse to patrols in plain clothes. If an unreasonable article didappear this Sunday, it was possible that a reply might be delivered in a major speech. 
3. Although there has been little change in the security situation, two dangers 
in particular remain: that Provisionals who have been in the Republic will step up their activity in Northern Ireland; and that Protestant extremists will grow in strength. Any information about the Provisionals in the Republic which could be passed to the authorities there for action should be sent to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 
4. The next meetings are due to take place at noon on 10 and 13 October in Conference Room B.

Northern Ireland Two memoranda by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland are 
to be considered by Ministers at the meeting of GEN 79 tomorrow. The first is GEN 79(72) 23, a Note by the Secretary of State covering four memoranda by Northern Ireland officials on future developments; the second is GEN 79(72) 24, a Note by the Secretary of State reporting on the present state of play and suggesting a timetable of work for the next few months. 2. 
The second memorandum is the more urgent in terms of the need 
for decisions; and the Committee should therefore tackle it first. The main points on which the Secretary of State seeks agreement are as follows:(a) He suggests that the amendment of Regulation 24A, which would strengthen our hand in charging leading terrorists in the open courts, should not be made at present; that the matter should be referred to Lord Diplock’s Commission; and that, in the meantime, the establishment of the new Tribunals should suffice to enable us to deal with these individuals. The reasons in favour of this change of plan are deployed in paragraph 4; and the Secretary of State is probably on strong ground in arguing that the amendment of Regulation 24A would be likely to have a more favourable hearing in the House if it has the prior backing of the Diplock Commission. (b) 
It is proposed that the Green Paper should go rather further than a 
bare description of possible options for the future and should indicate the general direction in which we intend to move, not by committing us at this stage to any precise constitutional development but by indicating certain constitutional features which would not be acceptable. The question arises 
- how far should we go in this direction in the Green Paper? 
Ministers may wish to defer a decision on this point until a text is available; but the discussion on the second memorandum before them (on which see below) may throw some light on it. (c) Mr. Whitelaw wishes to publish the Green Paper by the end of October (paragraph 7(b)).

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 290700HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 to 020700 HOURS OCTOBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
The level of violence was higher than previous weekends over the last two 
months. On Fri/Sat there were 50 shootings and two explosions, on Sat/Sun 53 shooting incidents and 4 explosions. On Sun/Mon 27 shootings and.one explosion. Casualties totaled 2 soldiers killed and 3 wounded ( 1 x VSI); 6 RUC wounded; 18 terrorists claimed hit, and 5 civilians killed and 30 wounded. Most of the trouble was in Belfast with Londonderry and the Rural areas relatively quiet. The major violence was in the Lower Falls area which continued throughout Friday afternoon and evening and seems to have been started by Provisional action against the Officials; -this being a predominately Official area. The bombing of a Catholic club, perhaps by Provisionals, and a funeral procession were the main cause and apportunity for the serious violence between the factions and against Security Forces. 
This 
developed on Saturday into attacks on Security Force posts mainly in the Falls, but died away during the late evening with Sunday being mainly quiet. Meanwhile the Vanguard rally passed off ithout violence. RUC estimates of the attendance were 15000 including a parade of UDA members some wearing masks and carrying cudgels. 
Prayers for Peace meetings took place throughout the province. In Strasbourg it is reported that the Furopean Commission for Human Rights has accepted the admissibility of the Irish Governments’ charges relating to interrogation and internment.

also found 135 firearms, 15,000 rounds of ammunition and 4,000 lbs. of explosives in Protestant areas. It was believed that over 50 members of the UDA and 20 members of the UVF had been, or soon would be, brought before the Courts. The security forces were dealing with violence and terrorism wherever they found it. As to Father Wilson’s allegations, the Prime Minister 
had expected that Mr. Lynch would refer to these, and he had therefore been at pains to look into them. There had been references to a statement by 65 priests. Only three of these priests had been named. The statement had indicated that the Army was conducting a deliberate campaign of harassment and intimidation against the Catholic community generally. This was just not true. The Army were acting under very strict instructions about arrest and search operations. The Prime Minister did not claim that all soldiers were perfect; but, if complaints were made against the security forces, and they were found to be proved, appropriate action was taken. The system for receiving and investigating complaints was working satisfactorily. No less than 150 members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary were involved in investigating complaints. It was impossible to escape the conclusion that the IRA were deliberately stimulating complaints with a view to tying down members of the Police. If Father Desmond ilson was in fact beaten up by the Army, as he alleged, it was

be dealt with in future. He did not yet know how Lord Diplock would report, but it seemed likely that. his recommendations would involve new legislation at Westminster, which would not be easy for the British Government, despite the bi-partisan approach which had so far been maintained. The Prime Minister said that the British Government 
was particularly concerned about the wave of assassinations that had been occurring. He recognised that more Catholics had been murdered than Protestants. The police would be doing their utmost to apprehend the murderers and bring them to justice. The fact remained, however, that there were still 
a great many incidents on particular sectors of the border which were attributable to cross-border activity by the IRA. The Government had been keeping an account of these incidents, and he would be very ready to let Mr. Lynch see the resume which had been submitted to him. The security forces would be ready to co-operate with the Irish police and armed forces to whatever extent and in whatever way the Irish forces thought possible in order to reduce IRA cross-border activity. At the end of the meeting Mr. Lynch re-emphasised 
the desire of the Irish Government not merely to be helpful but actively to support the British Government in its

24 November 1972 
Dear Mr. Cosgrave, Thank you for your letter of 10 November in 
which you expressed concern about the decision to hold a poll in Northern Ireland on the issue of the Border. The intention to hold such a plebiscite was, as 
you know, first set out in my statement in the House of Commons on 24 March which also announced the decision to suspend the Northern Ireland Government. I considered it essential to find some way of taking the Border out of everyday politics. The obsession with this issue over the past fifty years has made it virtually impossible for normal exchanges on other political issues in Northern Ireland to develop in a healthy way. The fact that the result of the poll is widely 
regarded as a foregone conclusion has led to a belief in some quarters that the decision to hold it is a concession to extreme Unionist opinion. Nothing is further from the truth; and indeed some other parties in Northern Ireland are strongly in favour of the poll being held. The decision was made last March, and the reasons for it have not changed. I have made it clear that the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland must

BELFAST 2. 
Two youths fired 4 pistol shots through the kitchen window of 18 
Sandhill Drive East Belfast the home of Mr McIlroy(RC), fatally wounding him. There was an increase in shooting incidents in the Ardoyne and Andersorstown, where, in the Ardoyne, SF were involved in 8 of the 9 incidents opening fire 5 times, returning fire once and claiming 2 hits: in Andersonstown SF were involved in 9 of 12 incidents opening fire once and returning fire twice and claiming 2 hits. A 10 man CESA patrol was seen in Lenadoon West Andersonstown, SF allowed small standing patrols to be placed near St Genevieves and La Salle School. There ere various incidents of crowds seeking SF during the day to cause disturbances, particularly in the Ardoyne where on one occasion as a strong SF patrol was passing the Saunders Club Elmfield Street, 150 to 200 hooligans came out, apparently at a signal, and began bottling and stoning the troops. 11 baton rounds were fired in this incident. 
LONDONDERRY 3. 
There was 1 shooting incident when a shot was fired at a patrol 
in the Creggan, one returned but there were no casualties or hits. During the afternoon in the Creggan between 30 and 70 hooligans stoned troops. 13 baton rounds and 5 CS grenades were used. In the evening a crowd of between 40 and 100 stoned a patrol and 15 baton rounds were fired. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 4. 
There was one shooting incident: at 1614 hrs near Clady gunmen 
fired a burst of automatic fire at a mobile patrol from Bloomfield Farm in Co Donegall (often used by IRA as a firing position). Gardai who were already in the area on another mission quickly set up road blocks, but without success. At 1815 there was an attempted escape from the Maze Prison (Long Kesh). One man dressed in a "home" made Prison Officer’s uniform escorted another man in normal prison clothing but they were recognised by a real Prison Officer. In Armagh 12 youths stoned SF but were dispersed. Near Moy 19 rounds and 15’ fuse were found in a hedge and near Castlewellan an unexploded 2" mortar bomb was found.

Northern Ireland: Amendment of Regulation 24A The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has suggested to you 
in his minute of 17th November that we should wait for the report of the Diplock Commission before amending Regulation 24A of the Special Powers Act in order to facilitate the prosecution of members and associates of unlawful associations. 
This would mean reversing the decision reached 
at the meeting of GEN 79 on 6th October, when the balance of opinion was in favour of getting this done quickly. 2. 
The Secretary of State argues that, even by using the urgency 
procedure, we should now not be able to bring the amendment into practical effect until 11th December, which is just about the time when the Diplock report should be ready. I think that there is force in this contention. The proposal to amend Regulation 24A aroused a good deal of political feeling; and, with the Diplock Report now not so very far away, there could be accusations of jumping the gun. Mr. Whitelaw also doubts whether, in present circumstances, the amendment would lead to many more terrorists being put away by the courts. Moreover, if we brought Protestant extremists before the courts, juries might well be less ready to find them guilty than they have been to condemn Roman Catholic extremists. There would be political danger in using the amendment only against Roman Catholics; but equal danger if we brought extremists from both sides before the courts, only to find that the charges against the Protestants were being dismissed. Perhaps, therefore, the first step is for Ministers to decide whether a system of judges sitting without juries is the only way of getting cases of this kind treated impartially. As you know, the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland is said to be sympathetic to the idea of such a change.

be fatal to establish an form of provincial assembly until the rule of law had been substantially or completely restore.

A copy of this memorandum is annexed. Mr. Napier emphasised the dangers of a

Commission was wound up and local elections were held Londonderry was likely to become a Nationalist City, where the Union Jack would not fly and which The Queen could not visit. 
When asked by the Prime Minister whether 
Londonderry people of both commnities were thinking ahead to this situaition, Mr. Morton replied (after some hesitation) that if Londonderry became prosperous local people would not want to lose the link with the United Kingdom. Mr. Bryans said that there was a need far greater 
co-operation from the Republic in preventing terrorist incursions across the border. 
He hoped that the Prime 
Minister would be able to make representations on these lines to Mr. Lynch. 
The Prime Minister replied that he 
had done so on a number of occasions and would continue to do so whenever suitable opportunities arse. Mr. Morton and Dr. Keys asked whether there was any 
prospect of maintaining the Commission in being in some form after the local government elections. 
Although they 
themselves had no desire to retain office, local people generally felt that the Commission had acted responsibly and hoped that it could be retained. 
There was also a 
difficulty in keeping staff as the date of re-organisation approached. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that nobody wished to see the Commission wound up. 
But the Development Commissions at Craigavon and Ballymena were

There was a working party at Stormont Castle under Sir Harold Black, on which the Army were represented. Mr Williams was co-ordinating arrangements at the London end. 
4. Arrest Policy 
MOD stressed their need for a directive on arrest policy for Protestant extremists. It was agreed that any new policy would have to be settled at the highest level.

Review of the Position in Northern Ireland (GEN 79(72) 26) 
The main purpose of tomorrow’s meeting is to enable Ministers to 
consider their strategy between now and next March, when the first year of direct rule will have come to an end and the Government should therefore have given a clear indication of the "final solution". 2. 
assumptions:(a) That "if we maintain and intensify our political and security pressures on the IRA, the long battle against their terror can be won!’. (Paragraph 3). (b) 
the IRA before Motorman". (Paragraph 4). 3. 
The Secretary of State’s proposals for this purpose are based on two That "the Protestant extremists now present a mirror image of The Secretary of State suggests that, against this background, the 
broad lines of our future strategy, as regards both the majority and the minority, are clear - namely to continue to seek increasingly to isolate the extremists from the moderates; to diminish the capacity of the extremists for violence; and to develop the hope and prospect of a peaceful political settlement. He suggests also that these aims need to be pursued simultaneously on both the security and the political fronts. As regards the former he would prefer to develop his thoughts orally tomorrow. As regards the latter he envisages a phased programme of action, starting with further consultations on the basis of the Green Paper in order to narrow down more precisely the area within which a settlement must be sought; proceeding, at about the turn of the year, to the plebiscite on the Border; and culminating in the publication, in the spring, of a White Paper disclosing the Government’s definitive proposals for a settlement. 4. 
Itis difficult to fault this progression as a programme of action. 
But Ministers will need to consider it from two different pointsof view first, if it succeeds; second, if it fals. 
Its chances of success depend 
partly, as the Secretary of State recognises, on the extent to which the further security measures which he has in mind prove to be sufficient 
Files\\EKG_round1\\PREM 15 1015\\IMG_8407_PREM_15_1015 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]

to deal not only with the IRA but with the Protestant extremists. It will be very relevant to learn what these measures are; what further demands they are likely to make on our military manpower (particularly during the period of the plebiscite); and how highly the Secretary of State rates their chances of bringing Protestant, as well as IRA, extremism under control. 
It is 
becoming increasingly important that our security measures should be and should be seen to be - impartial as between the two factions. There is still suspicion in some quarters that we are more lenient in dealing with Protestants than with the IRA and that, if we could only persuade the former to behave rather better the Army could get on with its "real" job of defeating the latter. We must try to dispel this suspicion by demonstrating that we intend to deal equally, and equally firmly, with both types of extremists. Otherwise, moderate opinion will never speak up; and this could be critical during the period of the plebiscite. 5. 
As regards action on the political front, the Secretary of State 
envisages that between now and the publication of the White Paper in the spring he will need to consult his colleagues from time to time about the shape of the definitive solution. This will be particularly important in relation to responsibility for security (where the Secretary of State refers to "certain ideas of an evolutionary character", which he would prefer to deploy orally) and to the degree of devolution to be permitted in the field of finance. We can only await the disclosure of these proposals. But it may not be premature to comment at this stage on the Secretary of State’s final suggestion that, after the publication of the White Paper but before the introduction of the Bill, we should undertake some further test of public opinion in Northern Ireland about the probable acceptability of our definitive solution. We cannot form a final view on this suggestion until we know the shape of the proposals themselves. But Ministers may wish to consider, even tomorrow, whether it would really be wise to provide the further opportunity for this expression of public opinion. 
If all has gone as well 
as he hopes, we should, by March, be on the point of taking a decision a decision for which the great bulk of public opinion in Northern Ireland will, by then, be longing pretty desperately; and it is arguable that the last thing which we should do at that juncture should be to show any doubt or hesitation about the course which we have decided to follow. 
Indeed, 
the result might be counter-productive, as the Secretary of State recognises in paragraph 14 when he says that "it might produce an obstinate polarisation

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 030700 TO 060700 HRS NOVEMBER 1972 GENERAL 1. 
The level of violence was low. On Fri/Sat there were 17 shooting 
incidents (14 of them involving SF) and nil explosions; on Sat/Sun 13 (11) and nil; and on Sun/Mon 15 (12) and 2 explosions, making a total for the three days of 45 shooting incidents (37 of them involving SF) and only 2 explosions, which is well below the recent daily average of 26 (19) and 2.4 respectively. Casualties totalled two soldiers wounded; one civilian attached to the RCT was killed in a road accident; and four other civilians were wounded. Three hits were claimed against terrorists. The main events ere the recapture by 1 PARA of Gusty Spence on Saturday in Belfast, and a series of border incidents on Friday and Saturday in one of which, on Friday, over 400 rounds were fired at a 1 A & SH OP from across and just inside the border near CROSSMAGLEN. Fire was returned. One soldier was wounded, two hits are claimed and in the follow up three more men were arrested. GB Sunday press comment carried plaudits for the Green Paper (which more than sustains the NIO’s reputation for being the most ably staffed in Whitehall - S Times) and included a plea from Conor Cruise O’Brien in the Observer for at least one more question in the border plebiscite of the type ’Do you hope one day to live in a United Ireland’. On other subjects, S Times covered the spate of sectarian murders; the Observer covered the possible development of a rural campaign; and most papers gave varying headline prominence to the recapture of Gusty Spence. In the Republic, a mineral water factory at MUFF, Donegal, immediately north of Derry, was reportedly blown up on Saturday. A UDA ’commando’ claimed credit, and threatened retaliation bomb for bomb’. Elsewhere, Mrs Marie Drumm, vice President of the Provisional Sinn Fein, was arrested by the Gardai.

November 1972 1. The level of shooting has been similar to the week before but there 
has been an increase in the number of explosive attacks; particularly in the rural areas. On the border there has been an increase in terroist activity particularly in the Crossmaglen 
- Forkill area. Until Thursday 
Londonderry was very quiet apart from daily hooliganism. The main events of the week have been: the fatal wounding of a SNCO of 2 SG in Londonderry and a soldier of 1 QUEENS in Belfast, the theft of UDR SMG’s from Claudy RUC Station and the useful arrests of IRA "Officers" including two "CO’s" Leo Morgan (Ardoyne) and Gerald McDaid(Bogside).

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 270700 HRS TO 300700 HRS OCTOBER 1972 GENERAL 1. 
The level of violence was low. On Fri/Sat there were 31 shooting 
incidents (16 involving SF) and nil explosions; on Sat/Sun 22 (13) and one; and on Sun/Mon 17 (12) and 2, making a total over the three days of 70 shooting incidents (41 involving SF) and only 3 explosions. Casualties included one L/Sgt of 2 SG killed by a sniper in Londonderry and 2 other soldiers, one of them UDR, slightly wounded; two terrorists claimed hit (one in Belfast and one in Armagh, both on Saturday); and one civilian killed (a 16 year old RC shot on Sunday from a passing car in Cliftonville, Belfast, a mixed area) and six wounded. There were no major incidents over the weekend and nine marches in Belfast on Sunday were held without any trouble. About 1800 orangemen attended seven of the marches and the other two were by PD (1000) and NICRA (300), themes not known. James Strutt (31), UVF serving 6 years for armed robbery, escaped on Friday from the Crulin Road Jail. In the Republic, seven IRA Provos, four of them reportedly from Ulster, names not yet known, escaped from the Curragh military prison by tunneling. UVF are being blamed for causing small fires in four Dublin hotels, and for planting a bomb (defused by Irish ATO) at the railway station in Dublin serving Belfast. The Provisional Sein Fein AGM was held in Dublin on Sat/ Sun. There were reportedly 1000 delegates, 200 of them from Ulster. Rory O’Brady was unanimously reelected President. He apparently stressed the Provisional plan for a United Socialist Irish Republic based on regional government for the four anicent Irish Kingdoms. John Stephenson reportedly urged parallel political /military action. If there was a theme, it could be said to be a new emphasis on political action through local issues, north and south. In GB, weekend press comment almost universally welcomed the postponement of the local government elections. Other comment was largely devoted to speculation about the contents and likely effect of the publication of HMG’s paper for discussion

OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1. 
1972 - 1 JANUARY 1973 The level of violence has been lo compared with recent weeks. There have 
been 145 shooting incidents of which only 46 involved SF (compared with 172/89 the week before. There have been 9 explosions compared with 18 the previous week. These decreases may in part be attributed to the Provisional IRA ’ceasefire’ which ran from midnight on Friday 22 December until midnight on Monday 25 December: however it is notable that there was no marked increase in violence afterwards as there has been following previous ceasefires. Only two people have died violent deaths this week. 
and an IRA terrorist who was shot by SF). There were three explosions in the Republic near the Co Fermanagh border on Thursday night, it is not yet known who was responsible, but there could be retaliation in Northern Ireland by border ASU’s this weekend.

of manpower and asked therefore if some form of Civil Defence Force could be established to supplement the Army and Police. 
The Secretary of State said that many more recruits were required for the Police Reserve and that his fear was that 
any officially recognised Force along the lines suggested by Dr Paisley would have to be armed: this in turn would require legislation. 
Dr Paisley went on to suggest that it should be made an offence to fail to pass information to the security fores about terrorists. He believed that the Xilwee and the Tunnel areas of Portadown and the Drumarg Estate in Armagh should be cleared out by the Army and be dominated by them. In such circumstances the flow of information would be dramatically increased as had happened in other Catholic ghetto areas. 
Councillor Crowe referred to extra security arrangements at an Army post at St Angelo Airfield near Enniskillen and complained that barbed wire barriers erected there following the attacks with rockets were creating a traffic hazard. In spite of representations he had made locally, nothing had been done to remedy the situation. He also alleged that some information passed to the police was not getting anywhere. 
The Rev Beattie said that with the assistance of the 
Chamber of Commerce in Lisburn they had been able to arrange for employees in premises in the town to join the RUC Reserve. This had had a dramatic effect in reducing the planting of bombs. He also had heard that many people believed ’phone contact with the police and Army was dangerous because lines had been tapped. 
The Secretary of state said he did not think it was possible to tap the Robot ’Phone service and would look into the possibility of publicising this fact. He also said that his Private Office could be used for passing information. 
Dr Paisley, winding up, said he would like to have another meeting before the publication of the White Paper. He felt that if the White Paper were to indicate any "weakness" in the constitutional link with GB, this would push certain elements over the brink. 
By "weakness" he meant, for example, the idea of a Council of 
Ireland being established while the Republic continued to claim jurisdiction over the six Counties of Northern Ireland. He felt that unless the Republic disclaimed such jurisdiction the elements in Northern Ireland and led by people like William Craig would resort to violence. 
These elements wanted a "confrontation" and this proposal would provide them with an excuse.

ultimate question of uniting Ireland was concerned, that must be a matter which only the Irish themselves could decide. 
JOINT SOVEREIGNTY AND AN ALL IRELAND COUNCIL 
In the view of the SDLP, there was a clash of national aspirations. The majority of the people in Northern Ireland wanted to remain British and would continue to do so under the concept of joint sovereignty. They would be able to maintain their own traditions and their own way of life. 
Equally, the minority community in 
Northern Ireland could not be denied the same rights and aspiration. If both sides were thus allowed to have the symbols of their beliefs, then the beliefs themselves would recede in importance. Joint sovereignty would involve shared political control for law and order, for taxation and finance, and for a wide range of social, economic and political functions. The basis for this would be a National Senate of Ireland which would deal with matters of Commons concern, would be served by an independent secretariat and would also concern itself with the eventual evolution of Irish unity. Not only would the Northern Protestants retain their British membership but the Government of the Republic would give up its claim to sovereignty over the whole of the 32 Counties. Disagreements between the two communities would be resolved in the constitutional court which would also have the power to pass legislation provided a 75 per cent majority were forthcoming. The two Commissioners would also have an important role in the resolution of problems. Above all, these institutions should have power; they should have the necessary authority and executive control to deal with situations of common concern. To it must be recruited the most able and ambitious of the people in the Dail and the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Secretary of State said that any concept of an all-Ireland Council was bound to be seen by militant Protestants as the first step to a United Ireland. He did not accept that such a proposal would be convincing enough to the majority to bring about the reasonable acceptance of the settlement which the SDLP thought would occur. In particular he foresaw difficulty over a constitutional court being able to reconcile the differences in the way the SDLP suggested. Equally he believed it was important that changes should be made and that a solution should be evolved which would give the minority in Northern Ireland a much greater share in the affairs of state. It was important

NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NOON ON 8 DECEMBER 1. Border Poll 
The Secretary of State intends to announce on Thursday the date on which the Border Poll will be held. This will probably be 15 March. 
The question of which should come first - Border Poll or White Paper - will not be disclosed until a later date. 
2. Detention of Terrorists Order 
The Detention of Terrorists Order has been approved by the House of Lords. Lord Gardiner’s contribution to the debate has been particularly welcome. 
3. Diplock Commission 
Lord Diplock’s report has been presented to the Secretary of State. A submission has been put to the Prime Minister about the date of publication. 
The Secretary of State is particularly anxious that the report should not be available to anyone in Northern Ireland until Ministers have seen it. 
4. Rocket and Mortar Attacks 
The Secretary of State and the GOC have agreed that although the developments are serious not too much should be made publicly of the danger resulting from rocket and mortar attacks, and the skill of those using them. 
Representations are being made to the Russian Government through their Embassy in London seeking their co-operation in tracing the suppliers of the rockets to the IRA. 
5. Sectarian Murders 
The loan of detectives from police forces in Great Britain to the RUC is under discussion between the Home Office and the Chief Constable. HQNI have emphasised that the loan of 50 RMP to the RUC for the special task force will be difficult for them to sustain as it will mean taking RMP personnel away from other current priorities. 
6. The CGS Directive to GOC 
It was noted that the CGS would wish his directive to go to the GOC as soon as possible if the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland decides that a joint directive should not be issued. 
7. Mr Lynch’s reaction to the Dossier 
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office are not content with the terms of the understanding reached between HMA Dublin and Mr Lynch on the action to be taken

Action in the Irish Republic The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1972 is now law in the Republic. Under it, a statement by a senior police officer that he believes an accused man to be a member of an illegal organisation will be accepted by a court as evidence that the accused mas such a member. 
A measure of this kind would not be justified by present circumstances in Great Britain, but there has naturally been speculation about the extent to which members of the IRA and other extremists may seek sanctuary here. 
Means of combat in the IRA in Great Britain The main defence of society against the IRA and violence of all kinds, must be a strong, well-equipped and efficient police force. The police take appropriate measures in relation to actual or potential IRA activity in Great Britain. The effectiveness of these measures would be jeopardised if details were made public. 
Citizens of the Irish Republic: powers to refuse admission and deport These powers are set out in the Annex to those notes. 
Execution in Great Britain of warrants of arrest issued in Ireland If a warrant of arrest has been issued for an offence in Northern Ireland against an individual who is in this country, including the offence under the Special Powers Act of being a member of the IRA, then that warrant can be backed and executed by the police in Great Britain. however, a gap in that there 
There is, are no effective powers-to deal with members 
of the IRA ho are our own citizens by birth (whether in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland) and against whom there is no Northern Ireland warrant

The passing by the Dail of the Offences Against the State 
(Amendment) Act 1972 has naturally given rise to speculation about the extent to which members of the I.R.A. and other extremists would seek sanctuary in this country. 
There are two problems. One, stopping I.R.A. members getting 
into Great Britain. Second, expelling those who get past our defences. There is no reason to suppose that the I.R.A. are planning any campaign of violence in Great Britain 
, but we certainly do not want Great 
Britain to become the haven for I.R.A. extremists that Southern Ireland has been hitherto. On the first point, although the Irish traffic is now being watched by the police at ports of entry, there is obviously a limit to the success which the police might have in picking out individuals without any advance intelligence, and we cannot put all the Irish traffic through an immigration control.

A statement of y powers is set out in the Annex. When the 
new Act is in force on 1st January, I shall have adequate powers to refuse leave to land to identified Irish citizens who are members of the I.R.A. and to exclude from this country those who are identified later, and I have assured the Commissioner that I shall use these powers to the full. 
In addition, I am advised that if a warrant of arrest has been 
issued for an offence in Northern Ireland against an individual who is in this country, including the offence under the Special Powers Act of being a member of the I.R.A., then that warrant can be backed and executed by the police in Great Britain. 
On my present assessment therefore I am against amending the law 
The gap in my defences is that I have no effective powers to deal with members of the I.R.A. who are our own citizens by birth 
in 
(whether/Great Britain or in Northern Ireland) and against whom there is no Northern-Ireland warrant of arrest. There would for example be no prospect of "extraditing" an individual to Southern Ireland (under the Backing of Warrants (Republic of Ireland) Act 1965) for the offence of being a member of the I.R.A., first because this is not an offence under our law; and, secondly, even if it were the Courts would almost certainly throw out any such application on the grounds that it was a "political" offence. 
It has been suggested that this gap should be closed by proscribing 
the I.R.A. in this country, a coursewhich has been pressed on me on general grounds from a variety of quarters. There has been similar pressure to take powers to proscribe Arab terrorist organisations. 
You will be familiar with the difficulties, which were gone into 
in some detail when a possible clause was drafted before we took over direct rule in Northern Ireland. Under our rules of evidence, a law 
to proscribe the I.R.A. and I think that there was a lot of sense in the Times leader today. 
But circumstances may change. If the I.R.A. mounted a campaign of violence in the UK we should 
have to think again - although we might then want to act on the lines of the 1939 Prevention of Violence Act (but perhaps not limited to Irish affairs). This would raise the ghastly problem that it might become essential to reintroduce a system of control at the ports between all Irish traffic and Great Britain. I am having all this looked into further on a contingency basis. 
Then we have to bear in mind the Diplock enquiry. As I understand 
it, this body is considering what arrangements for the administration of justice in Northern Ireland could be made in order to deal more effectively with terrorist organisations by bringing to book, otherwise 
proscribing the I.R.A. would be difficult to enforce; and the new law of evidence which has been adopted in the Irish Republic, owing to the ineffectiveness of their previous law, would be quite unacceptable to Parliament here. There is also the problem that Irish extremists belong to a variety of organisations and clubs, and new ones are created; so there would have to be a continuing power to proscribe organisations. 
This presumably would have to be by subordinate instruments, subject to affirmative resolutions, a prospect which is singularly unattractive.

than by internment by the executive, individuals involved in terrorist activities, particularly’those who plan and direct but do not necessarily take part in terrorist acts.. If, at the end of the day, its report leads to legislation at Westminster altering the laws of evidence in Northern Ireland to enable members of terrorist organisations to be more effectively dealt with there, we should have to consider very carefully whether any of the recommendations had application to the present or foreseeable situation in Great Britain. 
On Thursday, I shall have to deal with a number of Questions 
inviting me to legislate against the I.R.A. in this country. I think that I am bound to take the line that on present information I am not persuaded that there are grounds for seeking fresh powers from Parliament; but that certain precautions have already been taken; that I shall not hesitate to use the extended powers given me under the new Immigration Act; and that I shall continue to keep the position under very close scrutiny. 
I am sending a copy of this minute to the Secretary of State for Scotland., Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Sir Burke Trend.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND A DEPUTATION FROM THE METHODIST CHURCH AT STORMONT CASTLE ON MONDAY, 4 DECEMBER, AT 12 15 PM 
Present: The Secretary of State 
Rev Edward R Lindsay Rev Dr Eric Gallagher Rev Frank Bolster 
Mr Whalley 
The deputation from the Methodist Church presented the Secretary of State with a memorandum (copy attached) which formed the basis for the meeting. They expressed their welcome for the Paper for Discussion and said that every effort should be made to encourage political parties, organisations and individuals to show constructive proposals. People should stand up and say that they had had enough violence and intimidation. It was encouraging that small groups were emerging all over Northern Ireland who were saying just this. These people should be brought out to express themselves before any final settlement was made. The Secretary of State said that he agreed with this philosophy but he pointed out how difficult it was to induce flexibility of approach into people’s thinking. It was essential that any settlement should last for more than two or three years and it was also important that Church leaders and other leaders in the community should encourage people to speak out in reasonable terms. He urged the Churches to do what they could in this respect. 
On the security situation, the Secretary of State said there was no doubt that the strength of the Provisional IRA had been considerably eroded with the result that they were coming to rely more and more on inexperienced members, at considerable risk to themselves. But as organised terrorism was cut down, sectarian murders increased. This was a worrying aspect of the current situation although detection was improving and public information via the robot ’phone was greatly improved. The Methodist Church deputation said that in their view there were no more CID officers in Belfast than there had been ten years previously. The longer the current disturbances went on, the more difficult would the task of the Police be. Police morale was very low. The

In my minute of November 21 on "Policy on the Border" I proposed that when you and the Foreign Secretary saw Mr Lynch you should give or arrange to give him an intelligence dossier on IRA crossborder activity, and offer the full co-operation of the Army, police and intelligence forces at all levels, to neutralise that activity. The minutes of your meeting with Mr Lynch record that you said "the security forces would be ready to co-operate with the Irish police and armed forces to whatever extent and in whatever way the Irish forces thought possible in order to reduce IRA cross-border activity". 
Mr Lynch apparently gave no definite reply to this proposition what follows appears to relate to future co-operation on political development. I have been considering how we might renew our proposals for full co-operation with the Republican authorities. But it would clearly not have been profitable to make any move until Mr Lynch was over the worst of the MacStiofain developments and until his new Bill had been approved, especially when these two situations were complicated by the Dublin bombs. At the same time we should not delay any longer than is necessary in seeking to introduce fuller co-operation now that Mr Lynch’s pressures on the IRA south of the border may drive the terrorists towards the border and perhaps even over it. 
I therefore suggest that we should now renew the proposals in my minute of November 21 and i. Arrange for the intelligence dossier to be handed over by Sir John Peck to Mr Lynch personally, together with the following representations.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 010700 TO 040700 HRS DECEMBER 1972 GENERAL 1. 
Events in Dublin again dominated the weekend. The anti terrorism bill 
passed all its stages and became law on Sunday. Two car bombs on Friday in Dublin killed two and injured 147 others. These outrages have been denied by both IRA and UDA, but they rapidly polarised political opinion about the new laws. John Stephenson is said to be recovering and has added soup to his menu. 
2. violence remained low. 
The situation in the Province showed no major change. The level of On Fri/Sat there were 25 shooting incidents (13 of 
them involving SF) and no explosions; on Sat/Sun 20 (14) and 2 explosions; and on Sun/Mon 25 (15) and 2, making a total for the three days of 70 shooting incidents (42 of them involving SF) and 4 explosions. The comparable figures for the previous weekend, less the 60 shooting incidents in the prolonged Ardoyne gun battle, were 58 (36) and 7 and for the weekend before 59 (44) and 8 Casuatlies this weekend totalled two soldiers wounded ( 1 x UDR beaten 
up and 1 x regular VSI after a rocket attack), one RUC Sgt wounded, three civilians killed (all murdered) and seven injured. There were 2 rocket attacks, both in Belfast. The first, on Satruday, was against an RUC station but the missile struck the wall of a house past which it was fired and exploded harmlessly. The second, on Sunday, was fired at a packed Saracen on march control duties. It penetrated the front left hand side of the vehicle. Bursting fragments very seriously injured a soldier standing in the cupola. Two other soldiers were blown out of the back of the vehicle by the force of the explosion. The CESA/SINN FEIN marches in Belfast on Sunday went off peacefully. 
3. Ireland was back in the GB Sunday press headlines. Lost of the major 
comment concerned the passage and likely effect of the Dublin Government’s anti-terrorism measures. Specualtion about the origin of the bomb outrages in Dublin on Friday was rife but inconclusive. Monor comment covered the outbreak of rocket attacks, the continuing inter sectarian murders in Belfast, and Mr Wilsons’s constituency speech which was critical of HMG’s slow. progress in either disarming Protestant extremists or accelerating proposals for constitutional reform. The S Times and S Telegraph differed as to whether these remarks put the continuation of the bi-partisan policy at Westminster in doubt or not, and Mr Callaghan’s remarks on Sunday did nothing to clarify the clatter. The Observer carrie a candid profile of John Stephenson

NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NOON ON FRIDAY 1 DECEMBER 1. Dates for Plebiscite ahd Publication of White Paper 
EN 79 considered on 30 November the range of options for the dates of the Plebiscite and the White Paper. No decision was taken as to which should come first. Administratively, it would be possible for the Northern Ireland Office to have the White Paper published in January, and before the Plebiscite. GEN 79 seemed reconciled to the fact that the administrative problems relating to the Plebiscite, coupled with the dead period of 15 February - 1March resulting from the new electoral roll, might well mean that it could not be held until March. The difficulties in getting Protestant extremists to accept this are recognised. 
2. Troop Reinforcements for Plebiscite and White Paper 
It was noted that the figures mentioned at NIOM on 24 November for the Plebiscite and the White Paper are not yet a basis for planning. Further, that it would probably be sufficient to have part of the reinforcement on a stand-by basis and not actually moved into Northern Ireland. 
3. Provisional IRA Ceasefire all. 
HMG’s position is quite clear. If the Provisional IRA want a ceasefire/they have to do is to cease fire. There is no question of any negotiations. Those claiming to be intermediaries will be told: "We will pass on to the Secretary of State what you say". 
If a ceasefire actually occurs, the profile to be adopted by the army will have to be considered in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time. In discussion the following points were made:- 
i. ii. iii. iv. 
A PNQ almost certainly be put down on the subject if a ceasefire occurred. The Press would probably ask what orders had been given to the army. The effectiveness of the ceasefire might vary from area to area. 
The IRA might give advance notice of their ceasefire, and step up the violence in the period before it. (as in July.) 
Sir William Nield summing up the discussion said that he would not be in favour of asking GEN 79 to make any decisions on the subject in advance; but that the policy should be left flexible and discretion given to the GOC to react initially as he thought best. Sir William Nield undertook to consult the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as to whether he agreed with this guidance, and thought Ministry of Defence might like to do likewise.

Mark Forrester Esq 10 Downing Street SW1 
You asked earlier this week what points the Secretary of State would like raised at the meeting with Harold Wilson this afternoon. He thinks the following would be a useful agenda: 
1. 2. The timing of the White Paper and the plebiscite. 
A general discussion on the security situation, with particular reference to militant Protestant action and possible Protestant refusal to work any White Paper constitution (the Secretary of State feels very strongly that Mr Wilson should be made aware of this last point). 
3. 
Any points Mr Wilson may have about the proposed White Paper (although the Secretary of State feels that sensitive issues such as representation at Westminster would probably be best avoided until the Government have considered them themselves).

this possibility, though he thought that they might well be able to re-establish their writ in smaller Catholic areas. Mr. Wilson asked the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State

Mr. William Hull was losing some support among the workpeople of Northern Ireland; but the power workers were loyal to him and this gave him control of the power generating and switching stations.

There were a number 
of decent moderate people such as Mr. Roy Bradford, but they did not count for very much. 
Mr. Faulkner’s line was that the Government 
would do well to rely on him, because the alternative was much worse. The Prime Minister said that he thought that Northern Ireland’s great problem was to find new leadership for the next phase. 
On 
the Protestant side no-one seemed to have any better suggestion than Mr. Faulkner. 
Mr. Wilson suggested that on the Catholic side 
Mr. Austin Currie was the best. Mr. Wilson asked how soon the Government expected to produce

undertake to have the whole settlement through the House of Commons and in being by the end of March, but the aim would be to get as far forward as possible by that time. 
The Secretary of State said 
that he had already met Church leaders, who had supported proposals for an Assembly and election by proportional representation.

expressed views of this kind. Mr. Wilson said that, whatever the Government did, they would 
probably find the Labour Party at Westminster supporting them. But 
he was profoundly depressed about the situation in Northern Ireland. British troops were now under fire from both sides, and he was appalled by the arrogance of the Protestant extremists. 
He feared 
that, even if the IRA was really broken- and this had been forecast too often before to be counted upon - the Protestants might not go peacefully home but might be even more arrogant than before.

all his experience in political life be had never before met a problem which was not capable of solution; but he was beginning to wonder if this problem was capable of solution. 
The Secretary of 
State said that he understood and sympathised with Mr. Wilson’s feelings; but he did not know that circumstances justified the depression which Mr. Wilson expressed. 
Too much should not be read into the extreme words which were so often used in Northern Ireland.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 240700 TO 270700 HRS NOVEMBER 1972 GENERAL 1. 
In spite of the meeting in LONDON between the PM and Mr Lynch on Friday, 
the weekend was dominated by events in DUBLIN, where John STEPHENSON (who is on a hunger strike) was jailed for six months (the minimum sentence) by a Special Ccurt, for being a member of the TRA, an illegal organisation. Earlier the same Court jailed an Irish radio journalist for three months for refusing to identify Stephenson’s voice on tape recording of a radio interview, which itself had led earlier on Saturday to the sacking by the Dublin Government of the entire governing body of RTE, the state TV and radio authority, for breaching an Oct 71 order "to refrain from broadcasting any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means." On Saturday evening 100 Irish radio and TV journalists went on a 48 hour strike in protest over their colleague’s sentence, effectively blacking out RTE programmes. On Sunday, Provisional Sinn Fein anger at Stephenson’s sentence led to peaceful demonstrations in Dublin (outside the Mater Hospital) and in LONDON (at the Aer Lirgus offices). An attempt to release Stephenson by force was foiled by the Gardai. A bomb (no warning) in a late night cinema in DUBLIN en Sat/Sun injured 25 people. 
2. The situation in the Province remained relatively unchanged, except in the 
Ardone area of BELFAST on Sunday evening, when an intersectarion gun battle developed, and soon involved SF (3LI), against whose OPs Republican gunmen concentrated their fire in between sporadic Unionist shooting. 10 hits were claimed by SF against Republican gunmen in this lengthy encounter. There were no SF casualties. Unionist casualties 
- if any - are not known. Apart from this incident (which accounted for 60 shootings), the level of violence was low. On 
Fri/Sat there were 19 shooting incidents (12 of them involving SF) and 4 explosions; on Sat/Sun 26(16) and 2 and on Sun/Mon 73(68) and 1, making a total for the three days (less the 60 shooting incidents in the Ardoyne gun battle) of 58 shooting incidents (36 of them involving SF) and 7 explosions. The comparable figures for the previous weekend were 59 (44) and 8. Casualties totalled 4 soldiers wounded and 6 civilians injured. One hit was claimed against terrorists, in addition to the 10 in the Ardone battle. 
3. GB Sunday press comment headlined the Stephenson affair. There was little 
speculation about the outcome of the Prime Minister’s meeting with Mr Lynch on Friday.

But the real reason was quite different. For fifty 
years the border had been the main issue in Northern Irish politics; and the Protestant working class had voted for the Unionist Party, even though it was a party of the right, to maintain the border. His hope was that, if the Border could be taken out of politics, a more normal political structure could evolve, in which the parties would argue about everyday issues of, for example, education or industrial policy.

Annex A to A/BR/30/3/1/M04 Dated 
March 1973 INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY AS AT 28 FEBRUARY 1973 
PROVISIONAL IRA 1. 
There has been further confirmation of the discussion between Northern and 
Southern Divisional leaders. Consideration is being given by Northern leaders to ’going it alone’ as they feel that both finances and lines of supply are sufficient for this to be done. They are still agreed on the need to intensify their campaign of violence when the White Paper is issued to mark their rejection of it. Trouble is expected from Protestants at this critical time and plans Are reported to have been drawn up to strengthen Provisional units in Catholic areas for ’protection duties’ and to augment ASUs in border areas. 
It is 
reported that at a meeting of Provisional leaders in MONAGHAN on 11 February it was decided that all trained volunteers in Northern Ireland should be put on active service before details of the White Paper were announced. Provisional leaders have expressed no great interest in the outcome of the Border Poll on 8 March but isolated attempts to disrupt its operation and todissuade Catholics from voting must be expected. 
OFFICIAL IRA 2. 
The Official IRA have been involved throughout the month in contesting the 
Southern Irish General Election and in broadening their base of political activities in the North. In particular they are reported to have succeeded in widening their influence in NICRA. It is their stated policy to urge the boycott of the Border Poll and to picket polling stations. In general the Official IRA leaders believe that the White Paper will be unacceptable to militant loyalists, which could result in a Protestant backlash, which will in turn threaten the Catholic enclaves. Because of these fears, and also concern about recent intersectarian violence, the DUBLIN official leadership have reportedly authorised arms in the North to be taken out of storage in Catholic areas in readiness. These arms are only to be used in the event of Protestant attacks and the Officials do not contemplate using them against the security forces, thus breaking the ceasefire. There hive been reports of joint Provisional/Official and CESA patrols operating in BELFAST. 
PROTESTANTS 3. 
In the aftermath of the rioting of the 7 February Protestant militant 
activity has been confined to isolated incidents of murder, bombing and intimidation. Political activity has centred on CRAIG’s attempts to rehabilitate himself as a credible politician and on the attempts of the United Loyalist Council (ULC) to form themselves into a political party. Although Protestant para-military organisations continue to prepare themselves for militant action there is no intelligence to show whether they have any coordinated plans of action should they think the White Paper unacceptable to them. Protestant activity at the Border Poll on 8 March will be concentrated on obtaining the maximum turn out of voters and it is unlikely that they will initiate any violence at this time.

March 1973 
GENERAL 1. 
The major activity during the month has been in Belfast. In the rural areas 
the level of activity has generally been similar to recent months and Londonderry has been relatively quiet. In Belfast there had been a progressive decline in the level of violence since Christmas until 28 January when the Provisional IRA made a concerted, but unsuccessful, attempt to kill soldiers. This was the start of a period of violence which included sectarian murders, gunbattles and shooting incidents. In East Belfast Protestant extremists were particularly active and incidents included rioting and shooting at members of the Security Forces. This led, on 5 February, to the serving of Interim Custody Orders on Protestants for the first time. Protestant extremists leaders used this as an excuse to call a general strike for 7 February. The strike was well supported in Belfast but elsewhere stoppage of work was due primarily to lack of electric power. In Belfast it was a day of violence by both Protestant and Republican extremists particularly in East Belfast where the most significant incident was the ransacking of a RC church and priest’s house in Willowfield. The Protestant mob, several hundred strong, was eventually dispersed using 45 gr PVC baton rounds ( the only time they have been used). This day of violence led to wide condemnation of Protestant extremist leaders, brought into question the political credibility of William Craig , and produced a general feeling of embarrassment amongst moderate Protestants. A period of ’uneasy calm’ followed during which both Protestant and Republican extremists were relatively inactive. The Protestants have remained subdued and have particularly avoided further confrontation with the Security Forces. The Provisional IRA however have initiated a number of gunbattles particularly in the Ardoyne, New Lodge and Lower Falls areas. 
In 
addition there have been sniper attacks and planned ambushes of Security Forces. Murders without any apparent motive have continued though they have been less frequent and there has been a signifcant increase in incidents of intimidation particularly of isolated Protestants and Catholics in areas dominated by the other. 
2. The main feature of the month has been the Security Forces’ success against 
the terrorists and particularly against the Provisional IRA in Belfast. Eleven terrorists have been killed and 30 other hits have been reported. In addition at least 139 Provisional IRA (including at least 48 officers) and at least 50 Protestant extremists have been arrested. During the month 68 IRA and 51 Protestant firearms were discovered. Another setback for the Provisionals was on 10 February when 2 bombers blew themselves up near Strangford. 
It is estimated that at least 
59 IRA terrorists have killed themselves since thepresent campaign started. Another significant feature of the month has been the increasing number of IRA punishment shootings (generally in the leg) which is considered to be a definite sign of falling morale. 
3. During February 7 regular soldiers were killed and 32 wounded. An eighth 
soldier died of wounds sustained in October 1972. The most common form of attack against Security Forces has again been shooting but command detonated bombs have also featured. Although a high proportion of the number of rounds fired at Security Forces have been in gunbattles, no deaths and few casualties have been sustained in such operations. The majority of serious casualties have been in ambushes and sniper attacks,the latter being particularly dangerous against static soldiers in the open (for examples when on ’lollipop’ patrol or guarding RE working parties). A particularly unpleasant method of attack has been the small bomb in a doorway, one of which injured a soldier on ’lollipop’ patrol in the Crumlin Road and another a marine on a foot patrol at night. There have

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
8 rocket attacks during the month one of which struck the turret of a Saracen 
and killed a soldier, most of the remainder have been aimed at buildings and have caused no casualties and little damage. Stoning and bottling of Security Forces continues and an unpleasant deviation during February was snowballs containing glass and razor blades. There have been 73 bomb explosions (Belfast 26, Londonderry 12, and Rural areas 35). The most significant feature of these has been a general reduction in the explosive content due probably to a terrorist lack of explosives. There have, as a result, been very few car bombs and the practice has been to plant the bomb inside the building rather than outside. The result generally has been more damage particularly from fire.

Belfast has again been the centre of activity. The month began in the 
piddle of a spate of sectarian killings which had started on 29 January. The first murder of the month was at 0820 hrs on 1 February when in East Belfast a grenade was thrown at a bus carrying Catholic workers killing one and injuring 9 others. These murders have continued through the month but have been less frequent in the latter part. On 3/4 February in the New Lodge an estimated 189 rounds were fired at Security Forces in a battle which was started by Protestants shooting from a moving car. Security Forces returned 168 rounds and reported 7 hits. Following the battle 6 Catholic bodies were taken to hospitals, 1 is known to have been hit by Protestant fire in the initial shooting and another later. On 5 February in an attack on a Saracen, a RPG 7 rocket hit the turret nd killed a soldier. On 5 February Interim Cstody Orders were served on John McCreary and John Halsall, the first to be served on Protestant extremists. As has been discussed above, this led to the strike on 7 February which started with relatively peaceful picketing of RUC stations but one of these led to the ransacking by an out-of-control mob of the RC church and priest’s house at Willowfield. Shooting was widespread particularly in East Belfast (where Security Forces hit 2 gunmen) in New Lodge (following rioting in the afternoon), in the Ardoyne (at the Louisa Street OP) and in Sandy Row (where a fireman was killed ).

Presence of a boy of this age in the streets at 0040 hrs and the curious coincidence of a tape recording of only one shot have not given much support to the IRA story 
although it has been more widely accepted in Northern Ireland. 
17. Further propaganda attacks have been launched against our use of plain clothes patrols and the occasion of the preliminary hearing on 27 March against Sgt WiLliams (who is charged amongst other things with attemped murder) will provide another opportunity. On the other hand the Provisionals have suffered a little from the publication of Maria McGuire’s book, extracts from which had previously appeared in the Observer. 
18. Protestants. The Protestant extremists came very badly out of the general 
strike and its accompanying violence on 7 February and have been lying low on the Propaganda front. Most publicity has centred on attempts to bring together an effective political grouping and to encourage a good turnout for the border poll. If speculation, that only a minority of the electorate vote for the continued separation from the Republic, should prove well founded the Protestants will have plenty of explaining to do.

TERRORIST BOMBING ACTIVITY FEBRUARY 1973 FINDS 1. 
March 1973 70 detonators were found by a routine patrol searching a derelict house. 
They were found inside a plastic container. 2. 
2 men stopped at a VCP were found to be in possession of weapons and 
detonators. After questioning, the men were persuaded to led the SF to a pigsty which contained a further 3 dets, 8 lb of commercial explosive and 1500 ft of Cordtex. 
3. SF search on information for a rifle thought to be in a particular area 
found a box under a gorse bush. It contained 155 lb of commercial explosive. 4. 
TECHNIQUES 5. 
6. Summary. In two cases an initial discovery or receipt of information led 
to further finds. This emphasises the need to follow up all possible leads and opportunities to obtain further information. 
Bombs are still being laid inside buildings. On the whole the explosive 
is positioned overtly by armed terrorists threatening the occupants. Holdalls and shopping bags are the more usual containers. 
In the majority of attacks against Catholic owned property, however, 
bombs are placed outside the building and are normally put in heavy cased containers such as beer kegs. Bombs are normally of about 20-50 lb in size, but larger bombs have been encountered. In general the bombs used against Catholic owned property have been larger than those used against Protestant owned property. 
7. 8. Towards the latter part of the month there was a marked increase in booby 
trappings, and the mining of roads and tracks against both vehicles and Personnel. 
In three oases where cars were booby trapped the initiating device appeared 
to be linked to the car door. The booby trapping of Army Eqpt has also occurred and finds of explosives 
have also been booby trapped. 10. The booby trapping of a petrol tanker was also a new innovation. 
11. An electrically initiated mine exploded in front of an SF landrover. On investigation the battery used was itself found to be booby-traped. 
12 Summary. The bombing of civilian premises continues. Devices put inside buildings are generally placed overtly. Booby trapping has increased and the more unusual aspects of this include the placing of a bomb on a petrol tanker and the booby trapping of stolen military equipment. 
EXPLOSIVES 
13. Of the devices neutralised this month, 1/6 of the total contained commercial explosive, the remainder were home-made.

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING 7 MARCH 1973 GENERAL 1. 
The general level of violence throughout the Province this week has bee similar 
to that of the previous two weeks. Four soldiers, one of whom was in the UDR, have been killed, one soldier has died from wounds received last month, and 11 Soldiers and one member of the RUC have been wounded or injured. Four civilians have been murdered. The SF have been involved in 105 of the 182 shooting incidents compared with 73 of the 111 last week. There have been 15 bomb explosions compared with 17 and 2 rocket attacks compared with one last week. 
2. A soldier was killed and another was wounded in 2 separate incidents when IRA 
gunmen fired at ’lollipop’ patrols in the Crumlin Road. These patrols exist in order to protect both Catholic and Protestant children who have to walk along the Crumlin Road interface on their way to and from 4 different schools. Each patrol requires a minimum of 120 soldiers and deploys 4 times daily because the children travel to school in the morning, home for lunch, back to school and home again in the evening. By the very nature of their duties the ’lollipop’ patrols are regularly on the Crumlin Road at fixed times and they are therefore vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Efforts to make alternative arrangements continue and on Monday agreement in principle was given to providing free buses to take children to and from school. This will reduce the number of children on the streets at any one time. 
3. After 3 shooting incidents in the Lower Falls on Sunday, in one of which a soldier 
was slightly wounded, an SF patrol carried out a hot-pursuit search of a house in which a gunman had been seen. A crowd of about 30 hostile women gathered in the area. Because the crowd were becoming increasingly hostile, the patrol commander decided to withdraw from the area as soon as the house had been searched. The women harassed and seriously obstructed the soldiers as they entered their armoured vehicle. A quick check was made and as it was thought that all the patrol were present the vehicle drove back to the SF base. It subsequently transpired that some of the women had separated one soldier from his colleagues. Within 10 minutes the SF were back at the scene but, by this time, the soldier had been shot twice and his rifle and ammunition had been stolen. He died later that night. Every effort is being made to arrest a Provisional who is thought to have been the assassin. 
4. Three other members of the SF have died during the week. A Staff Sergeant the 
UDR was abducted in his car, murdered and his body left beside the road in the Enclave near Londonderry on Saturday. When his burnt-out car was found by the SF near the Border there was an exchange of fire between gunmen and the SF who reported one hit. On Monday a soldier died of wounds received during the disturbances in East Belfast on 7 February 1973. He is the second soldier to have died as the result of violence by extreme Protestants. A soldier on foot patrol in the Ballymurphy area was killed by a sniper on Tuesday. 
5. The murders of 4 civilians, 3 Catholics and one Protestant, all took place it 
Belfast. Although one Catholic may have been murdered by the IRA as a punishment, the other 3 crimes appear to have been sectarian. In one of these, a Catholic bus driver was shot on Friday in the Woodvale Road by 2 armed youths who boarded the bus at a bus stop, killed the driver, wounded his relief and then drove away in a car. The youths are believed to be in the UVF. The drivers of the Belfast Corporation buses subsequently stopped work for 4 days as a protest against the murder of their colleagu Later the same day the IRA retaliated by murdering the secretary of an Orange Lodge in Ligoniel.

6. There have been 7 explosions in Belfast, 2 in Londonderry, 2 in Newry, one in 
Newcastle, one on the Glenshane Pass near Dungiven, one near Bessbrook and one near Forkill. Four of the 7 explosions in Belfast are thought to have been the work of Protestant extemists and the remainder were probably IRA bombs. The explosion in Forkill was in a booby trapped house and injured 3 soldiers,one very seriously. The Official IRA have claimed responsiblity stating it was a retaliation for the death of a 13 year old boy last week. This act is consistent with the conditions of their ceasefire and is a sign that the new leadership of the Official IRA in Newry is becoming more militant. The most serious rocket attack occurred near Moy on Sunday night. The rocket was fired from a carefully prepared ambush position and hit a moving Saracen at a range of 200 metres. One soldier was severely injured. The casualties would have been more serious were it not for a combination of the rocket failing to initiate, the self destruct mechanism failing to work and the Saracen containing the minimum number of soldiers. The other rocket attack was in the Ballymurphy area of Belfast earlier in the week. It missed a Saracen and, although it hit a house, the rocket failed to initiate and little damage was caused. 
7. Two incidents in Armagh are significant. First, 8 firearms, 4 telescopic sights, 
1500 rounds of ammunition and an unknown quantity of cartridges were stolen from a licensed gunsmith. The robbery took place during the weekend and came only 10 days after the theft of 40 pistols from a Belfast firearms dealer. Extreme Protestants are likely to have carried out both these robberies. The second incident occurred in Armagh Prison on Monday. Five women prisoners, including attempted to escape early in the morning. Their attempt failed but 
it appears to have been well planned in advance. The women had a 20 foot plaited rope inside the prison and the progress of their escape was watched by people in a nearby house until the SF were called to the scene. A search of the Female Wing was then ordered by the Governor and this led to disturbances which lasted for some hours. 
8. The SF have arrested 89 suspects this week. Sixty five are known Provisionals 
and 23 of these are officers. The most successful arrest operation of the week occurred on Thursday when the SF raided a drinking club in the Ardoyne. CO 3 Bn Provisionals, 
known Provisional bomber and the direct consequence of his arrest has been the reduction in IRA bomb attacks in the City Centre since last Thursday. Other significant arrests include the OC Armagh Provisionals 
the OC Clady Provisionals Provisionals and an 18 year old girl, 
a Command Staff Officer of Co Londonderry who was a Company QM in Belfast. 
The SF have made significant progress against the Portadown Churchill Park Unit of the Provisional IRA by arresting 12 of its members during the week. The SF have recovered 16 IRA firearms. 
9. 
The SF have arrested 15 members of the UDA the most important of which is who is thought to have been responsible for bomb attacks in the 
Republic and is at present on bail for the illegal possession of arms. In one operation the RUC arrested 6 UDA men in Limavady in connection with armed robberies and this subsequently led to the recovery of 5 pistols. Eighteen other firearms were recovered from extreme Protestants and, at 2 separate addresses in Belfast, a quantity of illegally held medical supplies and radio equipment was recovered. 
the Provisional Brigade Explosives Officer, 
4 Company officers and 2 volunteers were caught. The most significant of these is against whom there is strong evidence of murdering soldiers. He is a

. In preparation for the Border Plebiscite on 8 March, 2 reinforcement battalions 
and an infantry company arrived in the Province on Sunday. One battalion was deployed in North Belfast with the additional responsibility for the Police Sub-Divisions of Larne and Carrickfergus. The other battalion placed a company under command of each major unit in 3 Infantry Brigade’s area. As a precaution against an increase in bomb attacks over the Border Plebiscite period Operation SPIDER, a large search, took place in Belfast on 5-6 March. The aim was to find the hiding places which might be used by extremists to store their explosives. This operation was carried out by all units in 39 Infantry Brigade and a total of 17 firearms, 880 rounds of ammunition and 575 lbs of explosives were recovered. 
PROPAGANDA 
11. The IRA mounted a classic propaganda attack over the shooting of the 13 year old Newry boy on 27 February. They produced as evidence a witness, who is known to be a minor IRA member, and a tape recording which is suspect. A further propaganda attack has been mounted over the incident in Londonderry when an off duty officer is alleged to have opened fire. The shooting of the soldier in the Lower Falls who had become separated from his patrol has resulted in bad publicity for the people, particularly the women, of the Lower Falls area of Belfast. There are signs that a counter propaganda attack is developing but it is unlikely to carry much conviction. Extremist Protestant propaganda against the Security Forces has been virtually non-existent. 
BELFAST 
12. The most significant incidents have already been described. The most serious case of hooligans rioting occurred in the Ardoyne on Wednesday night. The disturbances lasted several hours, the SF fired 304 baton rounds and one soldier had his leg broken by a rock. The number of shooting incidents in the Ardoyne remains higher than in other parts of the City and the daily average for this area last week was 6. The 3rd Bn of the Provisionals remains the most active even though 14 of its members have been arrested by the SF this week. At the other extreme, the 1st Bn Provisionals is both inactive and increasingly losing support with the local people in the once hard IRA area of Andersonstown. Members of the UDA, except for those living in North and East Belfast, have caused little trouble. However the intimidation of Catholics continues especially on the Ardoyne and New Lodge interfaces, in the Shore Road area of North Belfast and in the Willowfield area of East Belfast. The noteworthy incidents were: 
a. 28 February. LCpl Kennington 3 LI killed while on ’lollipop’ patrol duty in Crumlin Road. Prolonged disturbances in the Ardoyne. IRA bomb factory, including 2 RPG7 rockets, found in Ardoyne. Large amounts of illegally held medical supplies and radio equipment found at 2 separate addresses on the Highfield Estate, West Belfast. Catholic owned off-licence in Willowfield wrecked by an extreme Protestant bomb (5-10 lb). 
b. 1 March. Shamrock Club in Ardoyne raided by SF who arrested 8 
Provisionals including Kelly and Connolly. Two Catholics murdered, one in City Centre and one in Shankill area. Gdsm Mathews 2 COLDM GDS slightly wounded in Ballymurphy. A 20 lb bomb (probably Protestant) damaged Continental Cafe in Falls Road. 
c. 2 March. Catholic bus driver murdered in Woodvale Road. Secretary of local Orange Lodge murdered in Ligoniel. Constable Hunniford slightly wounded when youths tried to hijack his vehilce in Falls Road. Rocket attack in Whiterock area caused no casualties and little damage.

6. There were 8 explosions in Belfast, 3 in Londonderry, and 6 in the rural 
and Border areas. A bomb in Londonderry killed a 10 year old boy and this led to IRA allegations that, though they had laid the bomb, it had been activated by the SF. In fact, 2 anonymous telephone calls were received the previous evening stating there was a bomb, each caller giving a different address in the Creggan Estate. The SF carried out a prompt and thorough search in response to both calls but nothing was found. During the second search an IRA gunman fired at the SF and it thus appeared to be a typical IRA ambush. When the bomb exploded on the following day it was in a completely different street to those given by the anonymous telephone callers. On the Aughnacloy-Clogher road, a 150 lb mine was command detonated under a Saracen and 3 soldiers received slight head injuries. Three other soldiers were slightly injured when a claymore type device exploded in Cloughmore near Rosslea. This device may have been detonated by radio control. Another soldier received blast injuries and was SI after a booby trapped metal detonator exploded near a supermarket in Londonderry. There have been 6 explosions in public houses. Four of these were Catholic owned and the bombs are thought to have been placed by extreme Protestants. Two Protestant owned bars may have been bombed in retaliation. Those explosions caused a total of 2 RUC and 29 civilian casualties, 20 of which (including 4 SI) were in the Hole in The Wall Bar in the Antrim Road, Belfast. 
7. 
of assorted ammunition from a licensed firearms dealer in Belfast. The car used in the robbery was subsequently found in the Village area of Belfast and the robbery was executed by extreme Protestants. One pistol has since been recovered from a Protestant house in the village area. As a guide to the seriousness of this robbery, the number of pistols stolen equals the total number recovered by the SF in the previous 5 weeks and the amount of ammunition is equal to that recovered in the previous 31/2 weeks. Since August 1969 a total of 244 licensed firearms have now been stolen solely from civilian sources. 
On Wednesday 5 armed robbers stole 40 assorted pistols and 4,809 rounds 8. On Thursday James Bryson, ex B Company Commander 2 Bn Provisionals 
(Ballymurphy), escaped from custody in the Court House, Crumlin Road. He and an accomplice overpowered a warder, produced a pistol which must have been smuggled into the Crumlin Goal and ran out of the Court House. The accomplice was quickly recaptured but Bryson, one of the 7 who had escaped from the prison ship Maidstone in January 1972, has not been seen since. The nearby Unity Flats complex was searched to no avail so 20,000 photographs of Bryson are being prepared for distribution to the SF. 
PROPAGANDA 9. 
The bomb explosion which killed a boy in Londonderry has already been 
described but it provided the Provisionals with their principle propaganda attack this week. The IRA propaganda staff, who have often accused us of making the same mistake, make an error themselves by issuing an initial statement, withdrawing it and then issuing another which tried to put the blame for the explosion on the Army. They have not succeeded. Except for the fanatics, the people of the Creggan Estate believe the Army’s version. A second propaganda attack has come from the Catholic Citizens Defence Committee (CDC) who accused the Army of telling lies in the statement issued after an IRA ambush had killed 2 Coldstreamers in the Falls Road last week. The point in question was how many of the local people knew of the ambush. The SF’s view is that many must have known because the IRA had made extensive preparations to protect their ambush position and to secure their escape route; these were clearly visible to the SF in their follow-up to the ambush and must have been apparent to the local people beforehand. Militant Protestant propaganda against the SF has remained mild and nothing significant has occurred.

ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT At the GEN 79 meeting on 29th January, the question of 
amending legislation to allow full-time operational service and the recruitment of women in the UDR was discussed in the context of the forthcoming legislation on Diplock and other security matters. I have now been able to give further consideration to the policy aspects of these proposals; this minute is to let you know my views. 
Recruitment of Women 2. 
The UDR Act 1969 precludes the recruitment of women into 
the Regiment. However, in view of the increasing use of women in terrorist activities by the IRA (and possibly other extremist organisations) it is operationally important that the UDR, when manning check points, should be able to search women who, at present, mostly pass unchecked. This requirement could be met by the establishment of a section commander and 10 women in every UDR company to provide two female searchers on duty each night. Assuming that these part-time women would undertake duty one night in every five, a total of about 700 posts would be needed, at an annual cost in due course of about £0.25m. 
3. This is a requirement which can be met effectively only 
by the UDR. We are already making available as many WRAC as we can to operate as searchers with the regular forces, and will continue to do so. The RUC reserve has recently started to recruit women searchers: but searching is only one aspect of a wide range of duties which would fall upon these police women and there would also be problems of control in placing RUC reservists under the command of UDR patrols and difficulty in ensuring that searchers were available at the right time and place. Recruitment of women to the UDR is not expected to prejudice RUC recruiting; because the RUC have different and more exacting entry requirements, the UDR is likely to appeal to a different section of the population, and an estimate has been made that about 400 could be recruited within 6 months from the start of recruitment.

Annex C to A/BR/30/8/M04 Dated 26 Feb 73 
0700 HRS SUNDAY 25 FEBRUARY TO 0700 HRS MONDAY 26 FEBRUARY 1973 BELFAST 1. 
The SF were involved in 9 of the 12 shooting incidents. There was one 
SF and 1 civilian casualty but no hits were claimed. Both these casualties occurred as a result of incidents in the New Lodge. In the first at 1304 hrs a Saracen came under fire at the junction of Duncairn Gardens and Lepper St. The driver was wounded although not seriously. After the second, which occurred at 2046 hrs in Eglington St, a 16 year old Protestant was admitted to RVH with GSW to the leg. There was stoning and bottling of the SF between 1447 and 1730 hrs in the New Lodge and 67 baton rounds were fired by the SF. The SF searched the cells in "A" Wing Crumlin Gaol at the request of the Governor. Some documents and fresh earth were found. There were 10 arrests one of whom is the IO A Coy 3 Provo. 
LONDONDERRY 2. 
There were no shooting incidents. A 5-10 bomb was placed in O’Haras Bar 
in Brandywell by 3 men (1 armed) and caused extensive damage to the interior. At 1211 hrs a bomb exploded in a hedgerow in Leenham Gardens, Creggan fatally injuring Gordon Gallagher (10 
- RC). The follow up in the area found another 
device at the junction of Creggan Broadway and Melmore Gardens linked to the first device by wire. During the follow up a crowd of 300 gathered and children stoned SF. Sporadic stoning continued throughout the day. There was a peaceful IRA wreath laying ceremony in the City Cemetery attended by 300 people, some in para military uniform. In the Shantallow a boy received minor burns when a device under the floor boards of a hut exploded. He was taken to hospital and later discharged. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 3. 
SF wore involved in all 3 shooting incidents. The Republican march in 
Armagh was poorly attended. At 1949 hrs the band followed by 200 people started the march.in the wrong direction. By 1507 hrs the march had righted itself and was joined by another band and 100 people. It was halted by a SF barrier in Upper English St where a meeting took place addressed by Malachi Toal Martin Trainer and Bernadette Devlin. It broke up at 1600 hrs but was followed by outburstsof aggro and stoning during which 59 baton rounds were fired and 5 RUC received minor injuries. In the Catholic area of Portadown 4 vehicles were set on fire. During the evening Pte Craig 9 UDR was admitted to hospital having been severely beaten up in Antrim. At 0250 hrs outside Ligoniel, North of Belfast, a RMP task force car was ambushed by several gunmen. 15-20 shots were fired of which 10 hit the car. The driver received GSW to the back (not listed) and a passenger received a graze to the back of the head. In Strabane a car was hijacked, a bakery ransacked and the VCP was fired on. Outside Shackleton Barracks Ballykelly 2 bottles of acid were thrown at a SF vehicle.

MILITARY INFORMATION POLICY WORKING PARTY REVIEW NO 15 
GENERAL 1. 
Review No 15 deals with the months of November an December 1972. In this 
period, the main Republican effort was directed to propaganda designed to discredit security force actions, notably Army operations in Belfast; possible UDR/UDA links and the SAS. This anti-Army campaign reached a peak on November 20 with an attack on the Army by certain priests. For the first time, Communist bloc weapons appeared in Northern Ireland 
- Russian RPG-7 rocket 
launchers used by the Provisional IRA. Protestant extremists avoided military activity which risked a clash with the security forces. One arson attack in Lenadoon against Catholic houses was the most sensational effort. Though threats were muted, preparations for violent action continued. A special mixed RUC-Army task force was set up in answer to public hcrror at the increasing numbers of sectarian murders. IRA and extremist Protestant bomb explosions in the Irish Republic led to a new tough mood in the Irish Government. The IRA Chief of Staff, John Stephenson, was arrested, sentenced to 6 months jail and embarked on an abortive hunger strike. New legislation against the IRA was passed by the Dail to the sound of bomb blasts. Only minor IRA men have been arrested under the new powers but IRA men have gone underground in the South. Two Soviet journalists, Victor Louis, Moscow correspondent of the London Evening News, and Alexandr Efremov, London correspondent of Komsomolskaya Pravada, paid simultaneous visits to Dublin; as did Ernest Mandel, head of the Fourth International. In December, an Englishman, reportedly an intelligence agent, was charged under the Republic’s Official Secrets Act. The year ended with the opening shots from the Republican side against the White Paper, with the Irish Independent’s Jaes Kelly weeping crocodile tears about how it would displease the Protestants. 
REPUBLICANS 2. 
As recorded in the last Review, the successful security force operations 
against the Provisional IRA in the post-MOTORMAN period created little of the popular resentment on which Republican propaganda feeds. This contrasted with the resentment and propaganda which resulted from the 1971 campaign against the IRA. In November, Republican activists launched a number of press stunts accusing the Army of harassment of the Catholic population with the aim of diminishing activity which was hurting the IRA. The IRA and their sympathisers continued their character assassination of Brigadier Kitson and the GOC. The credibility of Army PR remained a top target. The SDLP, particularly Paddy Devlin and Ivan dooper, made much of the running. 
3. Three such exercises can be singled out. In each case the protagonists were 
people who would be convincing to people with no local knowledge. a. 
One such exercise involved a Mr and Mrs Turner of Ballymurphy. The 
husband, a former Royal Marine commando, married to a Catholic girl, made a series of allegations of harassment, principally against 1 PARA. These were printed in the Sunday Press and also by The Guardian, whose reporter, Derek Brown, was convinced by Turner’s apparently neutral background. 39 Inf Bde made a full investigation of Turner and found that he was not so

neutral. He was suspected of using his Northern Ireland Hospital Authority mini-bus to smuggle stolen medical supplies to the IRA. His allegations were either unfounded or exaggerated. A statement was issued by PR, the essence of which was published in the following day’s Guardian. 
b. The most ambitious Republican "stunt" was probably the "international 
tribunal" organised by NICRA and held in Belfast on November 18. The aim of the "tribunal" was to investigate the harassment of the Catholic population by British troops. It was headed by a lecturer in international law at Trinity College, Dublin. Among the organisations taking part were the (British) National Council of Civil Liberties, the International League for the Rights of Man and the World Peace Council, a Soviet front organisation making its second appearance on the Northern Irish scene. NICRA announced that it would present a 15-page dossier on "Harassment and Brutality by the British Army in Northern Ireland 
- a 
Sample of Typical Cases". This information was contributed by the Association for Legal Justice. The tribunal was presented so skilfully that it was attended by some Protestants, who wished to make complaints against the Paras. They withdrew in a huff when they found it was sponsored by Republican elements. One success of the tribunal was that the nature of the WPC was not publicised until after it had taken place, despite efforts by the Information Adviser. The WPC delegate was the head of the American peace movement and the WPC claimed that its headquarters were in New York and not in Helsinki. The tribunal’s findings have not, however, been published, and it made little impact on the local population. It will be interesting to see whether the Soviet Union continues to exploit the WPC role in Northern Ireland. 
c. On November 20, certain priests in Belfast called a news conference 
and issued a statement, said to have been signed by 65 priests. The priests accused the Army of shooting innocent people and a host of other crimes against the Catholic population. About a dozen priests actually attended the news conference. The names of the others were not released. The Working Party considered that the accusations could not be left unanswered. A hard-hitting statement was issued and the SO 1 PR made very effective use of this on television. The public involvement of priests in anti-Army propaganda led the Working Party to prepare an analysis of the incident for the GOC to table at Stormont Castle. This is copied as Annex A. 
PROTESTANTS 4. 
Meanwhile, Protestant ultras avoided physical and verbal conflict with the 
security forces, though there was plenty of evidence that undercover activities continued. The capture of 
the UVF leader, passed off with no 
commotion. The murder of "Duke" Elliott, one of the members of the UDA Inner Council, likewise led to no trouble. The Working Party has continued to exploit opportunities to discredit Protestant extremists in an attempt to alienate moderate Protestant support from them. Much has been made of the criminal elements within the UDA and UVF. The role of Protestant extremists in sectarian murders, liquor thefts, extortion and intimidation has been pushed hard. The general image of the UDA and UVF as largely criminal thugs battening on the fears of a largely law-abiding community has been effectively promoted. The Working Party considers, however, that a great deal more needs to be done to weaken the leadership and sap the morale of extremist Protestant organisations, who appear to be the biggest threat to the role of the security forces in Northern Ireland.

ARMY ATTITUDES 5. AND MORALE As evidence of security forces successes against the Provisional IRA mounted, 
the Army was faced with requests from the media to "crow". The experience of this and other counter-insurgency campaigns shows that victory claims by authority play straight into the terrorists’ hands, since it is always possible for them to make a special effort. Victory claims can even justify the carrying out of a spectacular act of violence with the aim of making Government and Army spokesmen eat their words. Yet it is important for the maintenance of Army morale and public opinion that the extent of security force successes be known. To avoid sparking off violence, to keep morale high and to inform public opinion, journalists were provided with facts without attributable comment. Thus it was journalists who said the Provisionals were being hard hit. The media are continuing to show themselves reluctant to knock down their own story, which is being continuously reaffirmed from their Republican contacts. Indeed, the only complaint received from journalists is that IRA contacts, cultivated over the years, are now locked up or on the run. 
6. The introduction into service by the IRA of Soviet RPG-7 rocket launchers 
and home-made mortars did indeed raise the spectre of spectacular violence in reaction to security force successes. But no-one was able to jeer at authority for having made empty claims. 
The rocket launchers raised certain information 
problems. On the one hand SSNI was anxious to limit publicity arising out of such attacks so that there was no public panic. On the other hand, there was a real risk that a rocket could kill a large number of people. The Working Party compromised and spokesmen stressed the inaccuracy of such weapons in the hands of all but the best trained. The danger of the rocket to its users was reported in The Guardian of December 29 when it was revealed that the shelf life of the rockets had expired and they were liable to go up prematurely. Fortunately, the IRA has continued to misuse the weapon and largely through this and sheer good fortune, the security forces have not suffered. Two APCs have in fact been penetrated by rockets. In each case one soldier was seriously injured and others lightly injured. We remain apprehensive that one day a large number of people will be injured in a rocket attack. 
7. In mid-November the GOC ordered greater emphasis in Army press releases on 
any security force action against militant Protestants, to balance if events allowed, our action against the IRA, and a general scaling down in attribution to units by name in favour of the term "Security Forces". Publicity on joint RUC/Army "anti-murder squads" helped demonstrate our impartiality. 
8. 9. During the period under review, CLF issued a fresh directive on the conduct 
of operations. The Information Policy Annexes are copied as Annexes B, C and D to this Review. 
A number of press articles originating in the main outside Ireland provided 
ammunition for renewed speculation over the state of Army morale. A Gordon Highlander in Scotland made headlines in The Sunday People by expressing a desire to fight for the IRA; the fact that 30 soldiers in 2 PARA (and similar numbers in other battalions) wished to purchase their discharge attracted attention; and the conviction by DCM of soldiers in 3 RRF on drug offences was linked by the media to service in Ulster. At the same time we were warned that Gerry Lawless of the International Marxist Group considered that the undermining of Army morale in Ulster was the main concern of the IMG and other left-wing and Republican Groups. In fact all this occurred at a time when Army morale in Northern Ireland was high. The danger to be guarded against is that a series of expose articles, news conferences etc, could create a myth of military disaffection, and myths can contaminate reality.

ANNEX A TO 240 G DATED 13 FEB 73 
CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT 1. THE ARMY The discrediting of the Army, along with the RUC and all concerned in 
maintaining law and order, has been a prime aim of Republican propaganda since about mid-1971. We refer loosely to such a campaign as "IRA propaganda" because the only people who stand to gain by it are the IRA. In reality much of what is alleged arises out of anti-British or anti-authoritarian sentiment not directly linked to support of the IRA. Nevertheless it is the IRA who stimulate and direct popular attitudes so as to bring pressure to bear to curtail effective counter-terrorist methods. In so far as Army activity to diminish the power of the IRA bears heavily on the civil population part of the campaign is self-generating, since people who resent our activities are never slow to report their sufferings, real or imagined. Honor Tracy described the special Irish talent in this sphere in these words: 
The charitable might say that the Irish tend not to minimise their sufferings; the candid that they are shocking old cry babies. If anyone lays a finger on them the world must hear of it with embellishment. And like children they believe in their own fantasies Furthermore, nothing that happens, no action of troops or police, relates in any way to anything done by themselves. Nothing is ever their fault, nor do they ever do wrong. 
Because the world at large is unaccustomed to this style of behaviour, complaints and allegations by Irishmen against the Army are apt to shock and disturb and even the most outrageous stories such as the activities of "Army assassination squads" create doubts and unease amongst those brought up in the belief that "there is no smoke without a fire". 
2. The IRA are aware that their own stock is low, even amongst their erst- 
while supporters, and propaganda overtly supporting terrorism or directly attributable to the organisation has small impact. Consequently they attach greater importance to front organisations such as Sinn Fein and Republican clubs, whose statements on news events are, however, mainly directed at Republican audiences and fuel Catholic grievances. The greatest importance is attached to organisations which claim to be fighting for justice and civil rights. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and the Association for Legal Justice are particularly active, the latter being a propaganda/ pressure group that has made effective use of its "justice" cover to inject stories alleging brutality etc into the British and foreign media. 
3. and October - 
Throughout the 3 months following Operation MOTORMAN - August, September the IRA’s attempts to generate public pressure for the removal 
of the Army from the Republican areas of West Belfast achieved little. People in these areas remembered too vividly how unpleasant life had been under Provisional IRA domination; they appreciated the reduction in the level of violence; and as our intelligence improved and we arrested many of the men who had intimidated and bullied, they acknowledged that our methods were evidently effective. Three factors seem to have combined during November to resurrect the full-scale campaign of anti-Army propaganda that has been muted since the introduction of Direct Rule.

4. The first factor is the law of diminishing returns, which dictates that 
once the security forces have picked up the worst and the majority of the terrorists, the effort necessary to arrest the remainder increases, with fewer successes to show for it. The second is the instinctive fear among many Catholics of seeing the IRA decisively beaten, a fear that effects many who were glad to have them off their backs after MOTORMAN. The third is the near desperate attempt by the IRA and their supporters to find ways of applying pressure on authority for the ending of effective counter-terrorist tactics; as the efforts of NICRA, PD and other committed groups had failed, the need arose to find uncommitted and influential people who might convince public opinion that the Army was misbehaving. 
5. The press conference organised by the Revs Brian Brady (St Joseph’s 
College), Desmond Wilson (Ballymurphy) and Alex Reid (Clonard Monastery) in Belfast on 20 November probably owed something to all 3 factors, Be that as it may, the following are our observations: 
a. Selected journalists only were invited but others who got to hear 
about it and turned up were welcomed. b. 
c. d. 
Only 10 priests besides the 3 named above were present. At one stage a sheet of paper was waved on which signature were 
visible. So far as we are aware, these 65 names have not been made public, which may be thought strange. 
It might not have been difficult for the Revs Brady and Reid to 
have collected signatures from 65 of their seminarists. These would hardly be representative of Belfast parishes. 
e. f. Father Wilson’s views on the Army are not new. At Appendix 1 is 
an extract from a book published early this year which expresses opinions formed long before Operation MOTORMAN. 
The printed statement issued before the conference and embargoed 
until 11.00 am strikes us as being the work of an experienced propagandist rather than a cleric. It is copied at Appendix 2, and an analysis of the Republican propaganda themes contained in it is at Appendix 3. 
6. We do not of course suggest that any of the priests concerned with the press 
conference intended to assist Republican propaganda, let alone the IRA. What does seem possible is that, in a sincere effort to demonstrate their concern at the plight of people in Catholic areas, the priests allowed themselves to be used by others with sinister motives. Certainly the news conference was effective. The Church is regarded as being above trafficking in propaganda and the suggestion that half the priests in Belfast had come out in condemnation of the Army, on humanitarian grounds, attracted wide attention. In a balanced and reasonable leading article on 22 November The Guardian nevertheless referred to the conference thus: "The allegations are horrifying; doubtless some of them are true." No smoke without fire. 
7. To counter some of the allegations made at the conference and in TV interviews 
with the 3 priests afterwards, an Army spokesman made a number of points. Next day in the Irish News there appeared a letter signed "One of the 65" which set out to discredit the Army spokesman by quoting the Rt Hon Richard Crossman as having said on RTE, "I must admit British officers DO lie in Northern Ireland and, under the circumstances, feel they MUST lie!" On the same day the Irish Press led its account of the news conference with the same "quote", using it in an identical

ANNEX C TO 240 G DATED 
INFORMATION POLICY - GUIDANCE TO UNITS ON OUR ACTIONS 
AGAINST EXTREME MILITANT PROTESTANTS 1. 
13 FEB 73 UVF violence and illegal activities by other Protestant groups receive 
exactly the same treatment as IRA activities. Successful arms and explosives finds in Protestant areas (and indeed full-scale street battles against armed extremists) are evidence of our determination to deal impartially with violence regardless of its origin or motive. 
2. If for the time being an illegal organisation refrains from attacks on 
security forces, the Army’s duties in aid of the Civil Power in respect of such an organisation are mainly to support the RUC in preventing or detecting sectarian violence or other criminal activity. (Our policy towards the Official IRA since that faction called off its violent campaign illustrates this.) 
3. Murders of innocent Catholics attributed to the UVF and other Protestant 
extremists have sickened the great mass of decent Ulster Protestants. We are concerned to isolate from public sympathy all who use terror for political or sectarian ends, and to encourage people to come forward anonymously and confidentially with information.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 150700 TO 160700 HRS MAR 73 GENERAL 1. 
There were 39 shooting incidents of which 26 involved SF (Belfast 30/19 
Londonderry 3/1, Border -/-, Rural 6/6). There were 5 bomb explosions all in or around Belfast. One of these was planted at the home of Mr Larry McMahon (RC) (the owner of 17 Betting Shops) and killed him when he opened the door. Also in Belfast 2 Catholics received GSW when fired at from a passing car. In the Derrybeg Estate Newry Paddy O’Hamlon (ex Stormont MP) was arrested (but later released) for stone throwing. In a shooting incident which followed a terrorist bullet hit a child. There were 2 arms robberies in the Garvagh area. In one a UDR man’s SLR and privately owned pistol were stolen and in the other 2 shotguns were stolen. In an exchange of fire following the latter a UDR soldier was wounded in the thigh. SF reported 2 hits during the day and arrests included 2 Provo officers. 
BELFAST 2. 
There were 30 shooting incidents of which 19 involved SF. There were 
no SF casualties but 3 PARA claimed a hit in Etna Drive. In the New Lodge 2 RC men were wounded but not seriously when automatic shots were fired at them from a passing car. There ere 3 explosions. At 2140 hrs in Jordanstown (N Belfast) a bomb exploded in the house of Mr Larry McMahon (RC) a well known bookmaker, killing him. His wife and 4 children were not hurt but suffered shock. The house was severely damaged. At 2300 hrs a bomb exploded in the Royal Hotel, Whitehead, causing severe damage and a fire. An hotel employee was injured. The hotel is owned by Mr McMahon. In Newtownabbey a bomb destroyed a youth club hut (RC). In New Barnsley a doctor was kidnapped and held for 31/2 hours while gunmen used his car; he was unharmed. In Beechmount SF arrested 2 men for being in illegal possession of subversive literature and military respirators; one man was Chairman of the local CESA and Tenants Association. Other arrests included QM B Coy 1 Provo and officer in D Coy 2 Provo. 
LONDONDERRY 3. 
SF were involved in 1 of the 3 shooting incidents. Arrests included 
4 Provo IRA Volunteers. BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 4. 
SF were involved in all 6 shooting incidents. The major incident of the 
day occurred during the afternoon in the Derrybeg Estate, Newry. At 1535 hrs Mr O’Hanlon MP telephoned 1 R HAMPS saying that one of their patrols on the estate were "behaving like F...ing animals". At 1540 hrs a riot began and a crowd of 200 stoned and bottled the patrol. O’Hanlon appeared to be the ringleader and they arrested him. Immediately following the arrest 20 to 30 shots were fired at the patrol and Eamonn Cunningham (14 
- RC) was hit (not serious). 
SF returned 31 rounds and 1 hit is reported. O’Hanlon was handed over to the RUC Having been examined by the RMO who found no injuries or other signs of physical assault. O’Hanlon was later released without being charged but a file is being prepared for submission to DP2. Late in the night 2 other patrols came under fire in Nery and in one incident a civilian was hit in both legs by the gunman who left behind a .303 rifle. Near Garvagh 4 armed men broke into the home of a UDR private and, while holding him and his father at gunpoint, stole his service SLR, 30 x 7.62 rounds and his private .22 pistol. At Cullyramner, also near Garvagh, 4 armed men broke into the house of a civilian and stole 2 shotguns. A UDR soldier exchanged fire with the gunmen as they were escaping and received GSW to the thigh. North of Belfast a bomb exploded in a brick factory (Prot) causing extensive damage but no casualties. In Tardree Forest SF found 80 lbs of white powder which is thought to be sodium chlorate.

maintain confidentiality about last week’s talks. Finally, it should be noted that Dr. FitzGerald specifically 
asked the Prime Minister if he and his colleagues could have a copy in advance so that they would have time to prepare their comment and make it as helpful as possible. For all these reasons we consider that the Taoiseach should be given his copy at the same time as Mr. Wilson, Mr. Thorpe and Mr. Rees 
- i.e. 
late on Monday evening. (Since St. Patrick’s Day this year falls on a Saturday, Monday, 19 March, is a Bank Holiday in Ireland, and the Ambassador may in practice find it impossible to deliver the White Paper until early Tuesday morning.) 
If subsequently there are questions, we could say that 
Mr. Cosgrave had been given in his discussions at No. 10 an account of HMG’s thinking, and that to have published a White Paper which involved references to relations with his country without a measure of prior contact and information would have been grossly discourteous. This is unlikely to cause the problems we once feared might arise, should the Protestant extremists allege prior consultation. 
We shall write separately about the personal messages to 
overseas Heads of Government. This need not involve any of them receiving an advance copy of the White Paper. 
I am copying this letter to Platt in the Northern Ireland Office and Rucker in the Lord President’s Office.

illegal liquor, but the UDA club at Ballyhackamore for example which was simply a darts club had been wrecked by the Army on a number of successive nights. 
The Secretary of State explained in detail the operation of the Detention of Terrorists Order and pointed out in particular that his function was to decide only whether there was a case to be answered before the Commissioners. He had no doubt whatever that some acts of terrorism had been committed other than by the IRA. It was for the Commissioners to decide whether the Protestants who appeared before them were in any way responsible for these acts. If he were given evidence of misbehaviour by the security forces he would have it investigated. There was no desire whatever to cause a confrontation with those who obeyed the law. If there were no violence or offences there would be no need for the Army to take action and they would not do so. Conversely if people complained that their windows were being broken and that they were threatened by men armed with cudgels the Army would try to protect them. 
Similarly if other offences, eg in respect of stolen liquor were committed, the security forces would properly take action. There was/ whatever to fear widespread use of Interim Custody Orders against Loyalists - provided that they did not commit widespread violence. The names of those who had been arrested and of those who had not, demonstrated that there was no plan to remove potential 
critics from the scene before the publication of the White Paper. 
In further discussion the following main points were made (a) The Secretary of State said that para-military organisations on the Protestant side helped to sustain the IRA. The position was made more difficult if people went on television and boasted of stocks of illegal arms and made other inflamatory statements to the news media. Mr Herron said that he had made a statement to the police clarifying what he had said recently on television. It should be appreciated that statements of public figures were often made for political purposes and not with the object of conveying information. "Chest beating" sometimes helped to stop trouble. The Secretary of State said that it sometimes caused it; those who made statements to the news media had a duty to weigh their words carefully. This was particularly true in respect of the White Paper, which would

(xxx) The Government favours, and is prepared to facilitate, the establishment of institutional arrangements for consultation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (par.110). 
(xxxi) Progress towards setting up such institutions can bet be made through discussion between the interested parties. Accordingly, following the Northern Irelend elections, the Government wil1 invite representatives of Northern Ireland and of the Republic of Ireland to take part in a conference to discuss three inter-related matters, the status of Northern Ireland, arrangements for consultation and co-operation in Ireland and concerted action against terrorism (para.112). 
(xxxii) The United Kingdom Government must be associated with discussion of sub touching upon its interests (para.114). 
Conclusion 117. Under the proposed settlement, Northern Ireland will continue to have a 
greater degree of self-government than any other part of the United Kingdom. While benefitting in full measure from all the practical advantages of the British connection - for the proposals embody political, financial and economic arrangements which are in general both flexible and generous 
- Northern Ireland 
will continue, to a very large extent, to make its own laws and administer its own services, particularly in relation to such crucial issues as employment, housing, development of the regional infra-structure and education. 
118. These proposals are designed to benefit the law abiding majority in both 
communities, who may have conflicting views on th ultimate constitutional destiny of Northern Ireland, but who eek to advance those views by peaceful democratic means alone, and have strong mutual interests in making social and

Paragragh 48 The first two sentences link the continuance of the office of the 
Secretary of State with the task of restoring stability and law and order. Is this right? It would certainly cause dismay among moderates and the minority if they thought that we intended to abolish the office when we regarded stability and law and order as having been restored. Perhaps the first sentence might be omitted altogether and the word "therefore" be omitted from the second sentence. Paragraph 52 The final sentence of this paragraph could raise the -potentially important - question whether organisations whose policies would be 
opposed to the settlement and might therefore implicitly involve overthrowing the constitution by violent means are to be allowed to put up candidates for the election. Are they? Or are the members of e. g. an extreme Protestant Party led by Mr. Craig to be in effect disfranchised?

Reports in the press that servicemen in plain clothes had been responsible for assassinations were wholly without foundation. Patrols went out in plain clothes to gather information, but they operated under the same rules as the rest of the army. Mr. Cosave said that he was not in a position to reply to 
the Prime Minister’s request for further cooperation until his Government had taken up office. 
He was, however, wholly opposed 
to violence, whether in the North or the South; and was willing in principle to do more on security if he found that there were further steps which could usefully be taken. 
There were, however, 
problems about maintaining an effective physical control over the whole border, much of which passed through remote rural areas. He would also be willing to consider changes in existing channels of communication on intelligence matters if the British Government wished. 
While he would be glad to cooperate in these ways, he 
would find it easier to do so if it were possible to give the minority community in the North greater confidence in the impartiality of the R.U.C. The Prime Minister said that he accepted that there were criticisms of Protestant domination of the R.U.C. 
It was, however, 
difficult to see how this could be changed when so few Catholics were willing to join the Force. 
It should also be remembered that 
both communities were represented on the police authority. Mr. Corish said that, although he personally did not accept the argument, the IRA were more readily able to justify their actions when they could point to the number of weapons held by Protestants, and the way in which they were paraded in public. 
The Prime inister said that the extreme Protestants could not be regarded as being on

Annex A to A/BR/30/1/MO4 Dated 25 April 1973 
HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING 25 APRIL 1973 
GENERAL 1. 
It has been a very quiet week by current standards. There have been 101 shooting 
incidents, 69 of which involved the SF, and this is the lowest total for a month. There have been 10 bomb explosions which is the lowest amount since early January. No members of the SF have been killed and, although 38 were wounded or injured, none of these was serious. A 13 year old boy was killed in the crossfire between terrorists and the SF but no other civilians have been killed as a result of violence and there have been no apparent attempts at sectarian murder. 
2. The usual number of Catholic and Protestant Easter parades, marches and 
commemorative services were held throughout the Province during the weekend. They all passed without incident although David O’Connell made a brief and unexpected appearance at a Provisional Sinn Fein service in Belfast’s Milltown Cemetery. The most noticeable feature about these Easter activities was that both the Provisional and Official IRA attracted fewer supporters than they had in previous years. 
3. The 2 most serious shooting incidents both occurred in Belfast on Thursday. The 
first was in the Clonard when at least 3 gunmen fired 60-70 rounds at a mobile patrol. Four soldiers were slightly wounded and a terrorist bullet also struck and seriously wounded a pregnant woman. Later in the day at least 2 gunmen fired about 70 rounds at an SF OP in the Ardoyne and fire was returned. During this exchange, a civilian car drove through the area and the passenger, a 13 year old boy, was hit and subsequently died. 
4. Of the 10 bomb explosions, 2 are thought to have been the work of Protestant 
extremists with the IRA responsible for the remainder. Six bombs were planted in Londonderry on Saturday and 4 of these exploded; one exploded in a Catholic bar slightly injuring one member of the SF and 3 civilians. Another significant incident occurred when a particularly cunning bomb was planted near the Border in the Forkill area. A lorry was parked across the road with a suspicious package in the cab, but this transpired to be a hoax to draw the SF to the scene. The terrorists expected the SF to approach from the north, the obvious direction, whereupon they intended to command detonate a double milkchurn bomb of 200 lbs. Having done this, the terrorists expected the SF to follow the command wires to their source where 8 explosive devices were well concealed in a semicircle round the battery; these would have been detonated by radio control. This triple phase device was defeated by a combination of the alert SF tactics in not following the obvious routes; the use of a search dog and a helicopter; and the skill of the ATO. The search and tracker dogs are proving invaluable in these type of operations and, since the successful ’track’ following the claymore explosion near the Creggan on 12 April, they are increasingly in demand. Culvert mines remain a serious threat to the SF in the rural and Border areas. Although the number of bomb and mine explosions this week is fewer than usual, a further 17 bombs or mines were neutralized by EOD units after they had been planted. There were in addition 8 hoaxes and 35 false alarms. 
5. The SF arrested a total of 149 suspects of whom 70 have either IRA or Protestant 
extremist intelligence traces. Sixty two of these were members of the IRA including 17 officers.

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
6. The SF have recovered 12 firearms, 831 rounds of ammunition and 1,383 lbs 
of explosives from the IRA; and 32 firearms, 4,914 rounds of ammunition and 31 lbs of explosives from the Protestant extremists. The most significant finds include 3 weapons and a book containing details and photographs of ’wanted IRA’ men which were found in a Protestant Mission Hall in Sandy Row; and a total of 12 weapons, 3 of which had been stolen from the Department of Industrial and Forensic Science last month, and 4,264 rounds of ammunition which were found in houses belonging to the 4 members of the UVF mentioned in the previous paragraph. 
PROPAGANDA 7. 
The Republican propaganda offensive against the Army continues. Allegations 
have been made that the Army have not only shot unarmed men but have also been ordered to shoot ’wanted’ men on sight. Examples from the past have been resurrected to support these claims. The controversy over who shot the 13 year old boy in the Ardoyne during an exchange of fire between the IRA and the SF lasted in the press for 3 days and remains inconclusive. 
The serious wounding of a pregnant 
woman in the Clonard was not the subject of a similar attack because witnesses came forward to state that she was wounded before the Army returned the fire; subsequently an IRA armalite bullet was recovered from the wound. However, when 3 women were slightly wounded in the New Lodge as they went to the assistance of a wounded soldier, the propagandists attempted to blame the Army. In fact, no fire was returned on this occasion, nor on another in the Crumlin Road when a man received GSW to the leg. There are some signs that these propaganda attacks are increasingly recognized as such and are no longer credible to the moderate element amonst the Catholic community. Extreme Protestant propaganda has not been directed against the SF. 
BELFAST 8. 
Belfast has had a quiet week. The SF have been involved in 34 of the 55 
shooting incidents and most of these took place on Thursday. For the first time this year a week passed with no bomb explosions and on 2 days none of the shooting incidents in the City involved the SF. The IRA fired an RPG 7 at a sangar outside the Vere Foster School and another at Roger Casement Park which missed and landed in the grounds of Musgrave Park Hospital; neither incident caused any significant damage or any casualties. The Protestants fired 2 mortar bombs into the Catholic Ballymacarrett Area but both exploded harmlessly short of their target. Additional measures taken by the SF to prevent sectarian murders include the closure of the Grosvenor Road from 1830 to 0400 hrs daily and the erection of more barriers and ramps in the Markets area. The noteworthy incidents were: 
a. 18 April. A hand grenade was thrown into an SF armoured vehicle 
in the Divis Flats area but failed to explode. No more than 250 people attended a meeting in the Ardoyne to protest about the SF although the oganizers claimed that 2,500 had attended. Protestant mortar bomb fired at Catholic Ballymacarrett area.

13. The Official IRA have not yet exacted revenge for their recent losses in 
action against the SF. They may, therefore, make ’retaliatory’ attacks, perhaps of a spectacular nature, but it is unlikely that the ceasefire will be formally abandoned. Political activity in preparation for the local government elections will intensify. 
14. A significant escalation of Protestant militant activity is unlikely in the 
immediate future. The UDA and LAW will probably remain preoccupied with their political battles with the otter members of the VUPP. The extremist fringe of the UDA, as well as the VSC and UVF, may continue isolated terrorist and anti-Catholic activities. Further mortar attacks on Ballymacarrett may occur.

3. MCCANN REPLIED THAT HIS MINISTER BELIEVED THAT THE PARATROOPS WERE ADOPTING ’’TOO HIGH A PROFILE’’, AND THAT THEIR EXCESSIVE ROUGHNESS WAS ’’STIRRING UP THE MINORITY POPULATION’’. HE ACCEPTED THAT DEALING WITH TERRORISTS WAS A ROUGH BUSINESS AND THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF PROPAGANDA IN THE REPORTS. BUT DR FITZGERALD FELT THERE WAS ENOUGH SUBSTANCE IN THEM TO CAUSE HIM REAL ANXIETY. THE IRISH WERE NOT ATTEMPTING TO LAY DOWN A PRE-CONDITION, OR TO STRIKE A DEAL, BUT WERE SIMPLY ASKING WHETHER, IN ORDER TO FACIL- 
ITATE THE MEETING, WE COULD ’’IMPROVE THE SITUATION’’ (HE HAD NO SPECIFIC SUGGESTION AS TO WHAT WE SHOULD DO). THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THE IRISH ATTEMPTING TO HAGGLE AND STRIKE A BARGAIN: BUT IT WOULD BE EASIER TO HAVE THE CONSULTATIONS IN A SITUATION IN WHICH THE IRISH SIDE WERE NOT BEING SWAMPED BY THE KIND OF COMPLAINT NOW FLOODING DOWN TO THEM. WHEN I ENQUIRED HOW SOON WE COULD HAVE THE MEETING, MCCANN REPLIED PRETTY SOON IF THE SITUATION COOLS OFF. HE THOUGHT THE IRISH WOULD PREFER DUBLIN AS THE VENUE, SINCE THIS WOULD ENABLE ROWLEY TO SEE MORE PEOPLE ON THE IRISH SIDE THAN IF THE MEETING WERE HELD IN BRITAIN, BUT HE WOULD CHECK UP ON THIS. 
4. DESPITE MCCANN’S DENIAL THAT THE IRISH SIDE HAVE SET A PRECONDITION, IN PRACTICE THEY WILL PROBABLY PREVARICATE OVER ROWLEY’S VISIT UNTIL THEY RECEIVE SOME REASSURANCE FROM HMG. IF THE PRIME MINISTER AGREES TO SEND A MESSAGE, I SUGGEST THAT I GIVE IT TO THE TAOISEACH WITHOUT LINKIXG IT WITH THE PROPOSAL FOR SECURITY LIAISON, BUT AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME GIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALTERNATIVE DATES FOR A VISIT BY ROWLEY TO DUBLIN.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 120700 TO 130700 HRS APRIL 1973 GENERAL 1. 
There was a rise in level of violence with the SF involved in 22 of the 29 
shooting incidents (Belfast 23/17, Londonderry 1/-, Border -/--, Rural 5/5), causing 3 military casualties. There were 4 explosions (2 Londonderry, 1 Border, 1 Rural) causing 4 SF casualties in a claymore type device in Londonderry. Two RPG 7 attacks were both unsuccessful, one causing 4 civilian casualties in Belfast, the other deterred by shots from a SF sentry in Killea. The most significant incident was in the Falls when 2 Provisional Officers were shot (1 dead) during a protracted gunbattle. 
BELFAST 2. 
There were 23 shooting incidents with the SF involved in 17. There were 5 
military and 4 civilian casualties, none serious, and one terrorist was killed and one wounded. The major incident occurred in the Lower Falls where, during a search at 1645 hrs, a patrol pursued 5 men into a house and arrested 2. Three other men seen climbing over a back wall and were challenged and when they failed to stop were fired upon, one the QM D Coy 2 Provos, was killed, a second, the Training Officer D Coy 2 Provos, was wounded and the third escaped. There was then an interchange of fire and a RPG 7 rocket was fired at a Ferret Scout Car. It missed but hit a house injuring 4 civilians. More shooting followed and 3 soldiers received minor wounds. At 2126 hrs a home-made mortar bomb exploded in the road outside 139 Newtownards Road in East Belfast. There were no casualties. Five blast bombs were thrown during the evening but caused no casualties. There were no explosions. Petrol bombs were thrown at the houses of 2 Catholics in North Belfast but caused little damage. Another left in a bar in the Ormeau Road failed to ignite. 1 x Armalite was found in the Ardoyne. There were 8 arrests all Catholics one of whom is the Adj 1 Bn Provos. 
LONDONDERRY 3. 
There was one shooting incident in which a RC man was found shot in the 
knee. There were 2 explosions, one of which severely damaged a RC owned pub in North Ward. It was planted by 2 armed men who gave a 10 minute warning. The second explosion was in the Creggan when a 50-75 lb command detonated claymore type device was initiated at a foot patrol injuring 4 (one SI). Tracker dogs traced scent back to a nearby house whose owner is now assisting in police enquiries. During the evening there was rioting by groups of up to 50 youths in the Creggan and Bogside aimed at disrupting SF patrols and searches. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 4. 
There were 5 shooting incidents, all involving SF. A sentry at Killea fired 
2 shots at a man preparing to fire an RPG 7 and claimed a hit. Shots were fired from a car at a VCP sentry South of Newry. Fire was returned and the car hit. The Guarda were informed. In the other incidents there were no casualties or hits claimed. There were 2 explosions, one damaged a RC owned pub near Ballymena, the other was a 50-100 lb culvert mine which exploded near a RUC landrover West of Aughnacloy. There were no casualties in either incident. In Strabane there was some minor stoning of foot patrols and an attempt to stop a Saracen. In Newry 2 Armalites, a loaded magazine and some money were found in a search of a house. Two RC men were arrested as a result.

IFT contains the text of the memorandum referred to in the Prime Minister’s message, which you should also seek to hand personally to the Poe. 2. 
We also see considerable profit in a fairly 
general statement of support from the Pope for the White Paper proposals. Extreme Protestants in Northern Ireland may indeed be critical, as they would be of any comment the Popo made; but the Pope’s public support for the White Paper should be helpful with Catholics both North and south of the Border, and would be especially timely when Catholic support for the Provisional IRA appears to be declining. 
The last paragraph of the message has been drafted accordingly. You may 
to explain that we do not expect His Holiness to become involved in the intricacies of Northern Ireland politics; but that we do believe that a welcoming reference to the White Paper, and a condemnation of the evil and folly of violence, would help.

2. The procedures for internment which HMG had 
inherited were far from satisfactory, and there was the general question whether any special procedures for detention were necessary at all. The Government therefore appointed a Commission, composed of distinguished laymen and lawyers, and chaired by a most eminent judge of the House of Lords, Lord Diplock. The Commission was asked to find out whether terrorist activity could be dealt with by the criminal courts. In December 1972 they reported that, because witnesses were intimidated or afraid to give evidence, no criminal procedure which satisfied the requirements of Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights could effectively bring terrorists to justice. 
3. While the Commission was deliberating, the 
Government proposed, and Parliament in Westminster approved, the abolition of internment by the Executive as it had been practised 
Northern 
Ireland law, and the enactment, as an interim measure pending the Commission’s Report, procedures for detention. 
4. 
Specific safeguards were incorporated, which have been in operation since 7 November 1972, as follows:

(a) no-one may be detained for more than 28 days without his case being referred for adjudication to an independent, legally-qualified commissioner; 
(b) the commissioner must enquire into any case referred to him to see whether the person has been concerned in terrorism, and, if so, whether his detention is necessary for the protection of the public; 
(c) a person detained by order of a commissioner has a right of appeal to an independent tribunal; 
(d) a person appearing before a commissioner is given in advance a statement of the terrorist activities he is alleged to have engaged in; 
(e) such a person may give evidence and be legally represented. 
This is a far cry from internment. Where these procedures contain departures from the normal judicial process 
the commissioners’ inquiries are in private, 
for example, and the person who is the subject of the enquiry may be excluded from parts of it) these are necessary because, as the Commission reported, witnesses will not give evidence in the ordinary courts. The procedures contain all possible safeguards against injustice.

5. No-one is now detained except under these 
procedures and those detained have been found by an independent commissioner with legal training and experience to have been involved in terrorism and to be someone from whom the public need to be protected. The Government would greatly prefer it if the ordinary criminal procedures were effective in bringing these people to justice, but the findings of the Diplock Commission 
and cannot be so effective 6. 
that they are not HMG therefore propose, in legislation which is 
now before Parliament, to confirm the new detention procedures, but to provide for them to lapse after 12 months unless they are renewed for a further period by Parliament. It will become clear(once the Bill is passed) that detention procedures are temporary and that, given an end to the appalling conditions which make them necessary, they will be allowed to lapse. H.M. Government have no intention of keeping these provisions in force a moment longer than is necessary.

10 April, 1973 
the Prime Minister sending a further message to the Pope about Northern Ireland. 
I wrote to you yesterday about the possibility of No. 19 of 6 April. 
The Prime Minister has now seen Holy See telegram He is not convinced by the argument 
in paragraph 3 against a further message dealing specifically with internment since he feels that a personal explanation from himself will mate much more of an impact on Pope Paul than discussions with Vatican officials. 
Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister sees considerable attracticn in a fairly open statement of support by the Pope for the White Paper proposals; and Pope Paul may be more willing to speak out if he can be persuaded that we have taken positive steps on internment. 
Subject tc the views of the Secretary of State for Extreme 
Protestants in Northern Ireland would no doubt be critical of any comment made by the Pope: but the Prime Minister is inclined to think than the Pope’s support for the White Paper would be helpful with Catholics both north and south of the Border, especially at a time when Catholic support for the Provisional IRA appears to be declining. 
the case for a further message until he has your advice, but it may be helpful for you to have this account of his first reactions. 
The Prime Minister will not take a firm decision in Ireland Office). I am sending a copy of this letter to Platt (Northern

6 APRIL 1973 THE PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE TO THE POPE WAS DELIVERED ON 
THE AFTERNOON OF 20 MARCH ITSELF. APART FROM THE POINT RAISED AGAIN ABOUT INTERNMENT (MENTIONED FURTHER IN PARAGRAPH 3 BELOW) THE POPE’S REPLY SEEMS UNEXCEPTIONABLE. 
2. I HAVE DISCUSSED THE WHITE PAPER TWICE WITH ARCHBISHOP 
CASAROLE SINCE 20 MARCH. DELAY IN SENDING A REPLY HAS BEEN MAINLY DUE TO CAUTION ON THE PART OF THE POPE’S ADVISERS WHO WERE, PERHAPS UNDERSTANDABLY ENOUGH, MORE INTERESTED IN THE REACTIONS TO THE WHITE PAPER OF ALL PARTIES CONCERNED THAN IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PAPER ITSELF. THEY WERE ANXIOUS THAT THE POPE SHOULD NOT BE ADVISED TO LEND SUPPORT, EVEN IF PRIVATELY AND IN CONFIDENCE, TO AN INITIATIVE WHICH WAS GOING TO BE OPPOSED BY ANY MAIN SECTION OF OPINION OTHER THAN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT EXTREMISTS THEMSELVES. BEFORE COMPOSING A FIRST DRAFT OF THE POPE’S REPLY, THEY APPARENTLY SATISFIED THEMSELVES, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN DUBLIN, AS WELL AS MODERATES ON BOTH SIDES IN NORTHERN IRELAND WERE, GENERALLY SPEAKING, IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSALS CONTAINED IN THE WHITE PAPER. 
3. AS SEEN FROM HERE, THE ONE RATHER DISAPPOINTING POINT RAISED 
ONCE MORE INTHE POPE’S REPLY IS HIS RENEWED PLEA FOR THE PRACTICE OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL TO BE ENDED, THIS WAS SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTED AS PARAGRAPHS 58 TO 60 OF THE WHITE PAPER DEALT WITH THIS POINT AND WE HAD SENT THE VATICAN THE TEXT OF MR WHITELAW’S STATEMENT MADE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON 20 DECEMBER LAST ON THE REPORT OF THE DIPLOCK COMMISSION. WE HAD ALSO SENT THE TEXT OF THE PRIME MINISTER’S SIMILAR STATEMENT ON 28 MARCH WHICH AGAIN DEALS WITH INTERNMENT. MOREOVER, THE PRIME MINISTER. HIMSELF HAD EXPLAINED TO THE POPE OUR DIFFICULTIES ABOUT INTERNMENT

AS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND, R WHITELAW HAS HAD DIFFICULTIES ENOUGH 
THIS PAST YEAR, AND COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT THESE TERRORIST UNITS BEING ALLOWED FREEDOM OF ACTION AT HIS BACK. I READILY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I SHOULD LAY AT YOUR DOOR, AND I CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT TO RAKE OVER THE PAST WHEN I BELIEVE THAT BOTH GOVERNMENTS CAN NOW LOOK FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE TO THE FUTURE. BUT WITHOUT EFFECTIVE ACTION TO CONTROL TERRORISTS OPERATING ALONG THE BORDER THERE SEEMS LITTLE PROSPECT OF ACHIEVING ThAT CLOSER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH WHICH WE BOTH DESIRE. 
WHILE OUR COMMON CONCERN IS WITH THE RISKS FOR ANGLO-IRISH 
RELATIONS AND FOR NORT-SOUT RELATIONS, IT IS THE COST IN LIVES THAT SHOULD DOMINATE OUR THINKING. I COULD QUOTE MANY EXAMPLES, BUT I WILL CONFINE MYSELF TO ONE. A RECENT CASUALTY (ON 13 MARCH) WAS A YOUNG SOLDIER BADLY WOUNDED PERHAPS 100 YARDS ON THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE RIVER FINN. (WE HAVE TO PATROL IN THIS AREA SINCE BOMBS ARE SOMETIMES BROUGHT ACROSS THERE.) I AM ASKING SIR ARTHUR CALSWORTHY TO LEAVE WITH YOU AN AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH OF THE AREA. THE INCIDENT WAS, I AM SORRY TO SAY, A ROUTINE AFFAIR FOR THE SECURITY FORCES SEMICOLON ROUTINE BECAUSE THE ASU FIRED FRO I THEIR FAVOURITE AREA WHICH THEY HAVE USED ON OVER THIRTY OCCASIONS IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS ALONE SEMICOLON ROUTINE BECAUSE THIS ASU HAS BEEN OPERATING IN THE AREA FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR SO SEMICOLON AND ROUTINE BECAUSE THESE MEN SEEM AT THE TIME TO HAVE BEER LEFT FREE TO TRY THE GAME AGAIN WHENEVER THEY THOUGHT FIT. YOU WILL NOTE FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT THE GARDAI STATION IS FIVE MINUTES AWAY BY CAR: ON 13 MARCH, A GARDAI CAR WAS APPROXIMATELY 450 YARDS AWAY FROM THE FIRING POINT SOME TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE INCIDENT, AND REMAINED STATIONARY THROUGHOUT. I WAS HOWEVER ENCOURAGED WHEN, DURING OUR TALKS, YOU SAID THAT 
YOU WERE IN PRINCIPLE PREPARED TO DO MORE IF, ON EXAMINING THE PROBLEM AFTER TAKING OFFICE, YOU FELT THAT FURTHER STEPS ON SECURITY CO-OPERATION MADE SENSE SEMICOLON AND I WAS FURTHER EN COURAGED BY A LOCAL RUMOUR THAT THE GUNEN PROBABLY INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT ON 13 MARCH WERE ARRESTED IN EARLY APRIL. SIR ARTHUR GALSWORTHY HAS REPORTED TO ME THAT YOU HAD TOLD HIM THAT, SHORTLY AFTER ASSUMING OFFICE, YOU HAD GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS THROUGH YOUR MINISTER OF DEFENCE THAT ATTENTION WAS TO BE CONCENTRATED ON SENSITIVE BORDER AREAS. THIS TOO I FOUND MOST ENCOURAGING. IT HAS SOMETIMES BEEN ARGUED IN THE PAST THAT THE BORDER 1S LONG 
AND DIFFICULT SEMICOLON AND THAT IF WE WITh 20,000 HER (IN FACT WE CAN SPARE ONLY ABOUT 200 REGULAR TROOPS FOR THE BORDER AREAS) CANNOT CONTROL THE NORTHERN SIDE, IT IS UNFAIR TO COMPLAIN IF THE REPUBLIC, WITH ITS MORE SLEDER RESOURCES, CANNOT WHOLLY CONTROL THE SOUTHERN SIDE. BUT WHAT WE ARE SEEKING IS NOT INTENSIFIED RANDOM PATROLLING VER THE WHOLE AREA, BUT DECISIVE ACTION AGAINST A LIMITED NUMBER OF KNOWN MALEFACTORS WHO CONDUCT THEIR OPERATIONS TIME AFTER TIME AT A LIMITED NUMBER OF POINTS ON THE BORDER. THE MAP ATTACHED TO THE DOSSIER DEMONSTRATES THIS. WHAT WE CAN IN PRACTICE B TOGETHER IS SOMETHING ON WHICH 
THE EXPERTS CAN BEST ADVISE. GIVEN UNMISTAKABLY CLEAR COMMANDS FROM THE SENIOR OFFICERS, I AM SURE THAT MUCH MORE PRACTICAL CO-OPERATION AT LOCAL LEVEL WOULD BE FORTHCOMING. HITHERTO, WE SUSPECT, IT HAS OFTEN ONLY BEEN CAUTIOUSLY EXTENDED, SINCE THE GARDAI HAVE BEEN UNCERTAIN WHETHER CO-OPERATION WITH THE SECURITY FORCES WAS POLITICALLY ACCEPTABLE TO DUBLIN. CERTAINLY THOSE ON OUR SIDE OFTEN DETECT A WISH BY YOUR MEN THAT THEY COULD SAFELY DO MORE. AT THE SAME TIME SOME SYSTEM OF ENSURING CONTINUING CO-OPERATION, HOWEVER DISCREETLY PRACTISED, IS NECESSARY. MAY I SUGGEST THAT AS A FIRST STEP WE SEND FROM BELFAST A VERY FEW EXPERTS 
- PERHAPS A SENIOR POLICE OFFICER SEMICOLON A LONDON- 
APPOINTED SENIOR OFFICIAL RESPONSILE TO MR WHITELAW FOR LIAISON WITH THE POLICE AND THE ARMY SEMICOLON AND A SOLDIER? THEY COULD DISCUSS WITH YOUR EXPERTS, ON A BASIS OF COMPLETE AND CONTINUING CONFIDENTIALITY, WHAT STEPS WE COULD TOGETHER PROFITABLY TAKE AGAINST VIOLENCE. IF A MEETING IN DUBLIN PROVED DIFFICULT, THEY COULD MEET SOMEWHERE IN GREAT BRITAIN. I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT THIS SUGGESTION WILL COMMEND ITSELF TO YOU 
. IT 
GOES WIThOUT SAYING THAT WE MAKE NO DISTINCTION AT ALL BETWEEN THE IRA AND PROTESTANT EXTREMISTS WHO MAY CONSIDER ATTACKING THE REPUBLIC. MAY I IN CONCLUSION SAY THAT WHILE THE SECURITY FORCES’ REPORTS 
REACHING ME DO ON OCCASION RECORD THAT SOME MEMBERS OF THE GARDAI APPEAR UNDULY SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOCAL PRESSURES, OR UNNATURALLY SELECTIVE IN THEIR ATTITUDE TO CRIME, MORE OFTEN THEY MENTION OTHERS WHO OBVIOUSLY TRY TO DO THEIR DUTY bY THE REPUBLIC, PERHAPS AT SOME PERSONAL RISK, AND EQUALLY OBVIOUSLY ARE ANXIOUS

be more readily communicated in all its horror by the media. But we were not happy with the lack of response to the representations we have made in the past. 
There is ample 
evidence that a number of Active Service Units have been operating from the Republic with little or no hindrance from the local Gardai, despite the fact that the persons concerned are well known. 
At regular intervals we gave details of the 
mounting toll of deaths and other injuries caused by the activities of these Units: and we gave names, addresses, maps and other documents. As you will understand, Mr. Whitelaw has had difficulties 
enough this east year, and could have done without these terrorist units being allowed freedom of action at his back. I readily acknowledge that this is not something I should lay tour door, and I certainly do not want to rake over the 
past when I believe that both Governments can now look forward ith confidence to the future. 
But without effective action 
to control terrorists operating along the Border there seems little prospect of achieving that closer relationship between North and South which we both desire. While our common concern is with the risks for Anglo-Irish 
relations and for North-South relations, it is the cost in lives that should dominate our thinking. 
I could quote many examples, 
but I will confine myself to one. A recent casualty (on 13 March) was a young soldier badly wounded perhaps 100 yards on the Northern side of the River Finn. (We have to patrol in this area since bombs are sometimes brought across there.) 
I am 
asking Sir Arthur Galsworthy to leave with you an aerial photograph of the area. a routine affair for the 
The incident was, I am sorry to say, Security Forces; routine because

the ASU fired from their favourite area which they have used on over thirty occasions in the past six months alone; routine because this ASU has been operating in the area for eighteen months or so; and routine because these men seem at the time to have been left free to try the game again whenever they thought fit. You will note from the photograph that the Gardai station is five minutes away by car: on 13 March, a Gardai car was approximately 450 yards away from the firing point some ten minutes before the incident, and remained stationary throughout. I was however encouraged when, during our talks, you said 
that you were in principle prepared to do more if, on examining the problem after taking office, you felt that further steps on security co-operation made sense; and I was further encouraged by a local rumour that the gunmen probably involved in the incident of 13 March were arrested in early April. 
Sir Arthur Galsworthy 
has reported to me that you had told him that, shortly after assuming office, you had given instructions through your Minister of Defence that attention was to be concentrated on sensitive Border areas. 
This too I found most encouraging. It has 
sometimes been argued in the past that the Border is long and difficult; and that if we with 20,000 men (in fact we can spare only about 800 regular troops for the Border areas) cannot control the Northern side, it is unfair to complain if the Republic, with its more slender resources, cannot wholly control the Southern side. 
But what we are seeking is not intensified random 
patrolling over the whole area, but decisive action against a limited number of known malefactors who conduct their operations time after time at a limited number of points on the Border. The map attached to the dossier demonstrates this.

What we can in practice do together is something on which the experts can best advise. Given unmistakably clear 
commands from the senior officers, I am sure that much more practical co-operation at local level would be forthcoming. Hitherto, we suspect, it has often only been cautiously extended, since the Gardai have been uncertain whether co-operation with the Security Forces was politically acceptable to Dublin. Certainly those on our side often detect a wish by your men that they could safely do more. 
At the same time some system 
of ensuring continuing co-operation, however discreetly practised, is necessary. May I suggest that as a first step we send from Belfast a very few experts - perhaps a senior Police Officer; a London-appointed senior official responsible to Mr. Whitelaw for liaison with the Police and the Army; and a soldier? They could discuss with your expertson a basis of complete and continuing confidentiality, what steps we could together profitably take against violence. 
If a meeting in Dublin 
proved difficult, they could meet somewhere in Great Britain. I very much hope that this suggestion will commend itself to you. 
It goes without saying that we make no distinction at 
all between the IRA and Protestant extremists who may consider attacking the Republic. May I in conclusion say that while the Security Forces’ 
reports reaching me do on occasion record that some members of the Gardai appear unduly susceptible to local pressures, or unnaturally selective in their attitude to crime, more often they mention others who obviously try to do their duty by the Republic, perhaps at some personal risk, and equally obviously

nor the new Irish Government do anything which would assist extremists, and especially Protestant extremists, in the run up to the Assembly elections. Any form of overt North/South cooperation could be used by, say Craig, to suggest collusion between the two Governments against the majority in the North. Dr FitzGerald suggested that he should meet the Secretary of State at Stormont but, for the above reasons, the Secretary of State said he did not think this would be a good idea before the Assembly elections. 
COOPERATION ON THE BORDER The Secretary of State said he was grateful for all the efforts that were being made by the new Irish Government to increase cooperation against terrorists on both sides of the border; he accepted that it it would be in the interests of neither Government to give any great publicity to such cooperation. 
Dr FitzGerald said that, if at any stage HMG felt that it could tell the Irish Government "anything useful", they would be glad to hear about it. 
RUC Dr FitzGerald said that, in his capacity as consultant to the Irish Police Federation, he had heard that many members of the RUC hoped that something could be done to re-organise; to bring in outsiders; and to give them a police rather than para-military job. The Secretary of State agreed that the RUC’s acceptability, or lack of it, was a major problem and, to this end, military police were being introduced in some areas as a forerunner to increasing the RUC presence. Dr FitzGerald thought that breaking the police into regional groups would help but the Secretary of State pointed out that this would do nothing to solve the major problem

March 1973 NORTHERN IRELAND FORECAST OF EVENTS - WEEKEND 30 MARCH - 2 APRIL 1973 
OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1. 
The level of violence this week has returned to the relatively high level 
experienced during February and in March up to the lull which occurred at the time of the publication of the White Paper. Both wings of the IRA, as anticipated, rejected the White Paper and the Provisionals stated their intention of continuing themilitary’campaign. Two events dominated the week. The first was the murder of 3 SNCO’s and the very serious wounding of a fourth, who were lured to a ’party’ in Belfast. This event produced a widespread feeling of revulsion in all sections of the community. The second was the capture by the Irish Armed Forces of a large consignment of arms and the arrest of 6 Provisionals including Joe Cahill. The number of arms finds this week have been very encouraging; not only have large quantities been recovered from both the IRA and Protestant extremists but many of the finds have led to arrests and further finds.

The Taoiseach of the Irish Republic, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, 
accompanied by the Irish Ambassador in London, Dr. O’Sullivan, called on the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street on Monday 2 July 1973 at 1.00 p.m. 
The discussions began over a working lunch, and continued after lunch until shortly after 4.00 p.m. 
The Prime Minister referred to the recent election 
of Mr. Erskine Childers as President of the Irish Republic. Mr. Cosrave said that this election had not been a surprise to him. 
The coalition which formed the present government 
had been able to attract a majority of votes at the last election for the Dail, but it would have been difficult to assemble a comparable majority for a single man. 
He thought 
that Mr. Childers would make a good President. Over lunch, the main topic of discussion was the results 
of the elections for the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Prime 
Minister and the Taoiseach agreed that the outcome to be desired was that the official Unionists, led by Mr. Faulkner, should come together with the Alliance Party and the SDLP to form a coalition from which could be chosen an executive which would meet the requirements in the British Government’s White Paper. 
Mr. R.T. Armstrong was also present. The fact that extremists had on the whole been 
rejected in the election was encouraging; but the dissident loyalists had secured an uncomfortably large proportion of seats. The Prime Minister asked Mr. Cosgrave whether he thought it possible that,as some people had suggested, the dissident loyalists led by Mr. Craig and Mr. Paisley might come to an arrangement with the SDLP on the basis of a refusal to work the British Government’s constitutional proposals. Mr. Cosgrave thought it unlikely that either side would be prepared to go into a coalition with the other. 
Mr. Craig and Mr. Paisley 
had said that they would have no part in a power-sharing executive. 
the sort of line which the SDLP had been taking. 
Such a development seemed to be inconsistent with But the 
possibility could not be completely excluded; and he agreed that it was a disquieting possibility. 
The Prime Minister

for it. It might be possible to proceed to a tripartite 
conference in the autumn, if the Northern Ireland Executive could be formed before the summer holiday. It was perhaps an ambitious programe to try to get the executive formed before the summer holiday, but he was sure that, the quicker the progress that could be made with the constitutional processes, the less support there would be for the IRA and other extremists. If it was possible to get the Assembly working quickly, that should help to undermine support for the dissident loyalists. 
The Prime Minister said that another matter which would 
arise at the same stage as the Council of Ireland would be whether the Irish Government could in some way formally recognise the status of Northern Ireland and the principle that that status should not be changed except by the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland. A move of this kind in the Republic would have an enormous influence in Northern Ireland. He recalled that, when they last met, Mr. Cosgrave had said that his Government’s agreement to meet representatives of Northern Ireland on an equal footing in a Council of Ireland would constitute de facto recognition of the status of Northern Ireland. Mr. Cosgrave thought that it would be preferable to proceed from existing realities without getting involved (he did not say in what, but presumably he meant without getting involved in changes in the Irish Constitution). Much would depend on the outcome of the formation of the Assembly and the Executive in Northern Ireland. It was obviously difficult to contemplate amendments to the Constitution; but the Irish Government would not wish at this stage to exclude any possibility from discussion. 
The Prime Minister noted that the security forces were 
now taking larger hauls of bombs and guns from Protestants than from Catholics. Mr. Cosgrave agreed that it wa right to show no toleration towards extreme Protestants, and to make the most of the contribution which the elections could make towards peace in Northern Ireland.

evident that - at the level of community fears - the 
settlment of 50 years ago, and with it the relative positions of the two communities in Northern Ireland, is still in question. In this situation each community feels itself under threat because each feels that it is potentially a minority. The crucial question is which of two potential minorities will be confirmed definitively as the actual minority when and if a settlement is reached. This is not a matter of logic or legality but one of emotions and fears. Unionists fear that they will and up as a minority in a united Ireland; Republicans and Nationalists, having as they see it suffered as a minority for 50 years, are not willing now to settle down again to a definitive acceptance of this position. 
This is the Irish Question of 50 years ago in a distilled and refined form. Any definitive settlement, it seems, must satisfy one aspiration and frustrate the other; and even talk of such a settlement either way in itself helps to ease one community’s fears at the cost of aggravating those of the other. The majority in each community seek peace. But they are also fearful and insecure. An extreme minority on either side stands ready to play on these fears and threatens to wreck by violence any settlement which might adversely affect the position of their community. 
This fear, this continued striving by two communities towards diametrically opposed objectives has generated an atmosphere of instability which has exploded into violence in almost every decade since the original settlement. It has occurred in the

Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly (GEN 79(73) 16) 
In this report the Secretary of State briefly reviews the terrorist 
situation; comments on the results of the local elections; reflects on possible outcomes of the elections to the Assembly; and refers to the timetable of Northern Ireland legislation at present before Parliament. Terrorism 2. 
The IRA are considerably weakened but still capable of spasmodic 
violence. The Secretary of State will report on the recent increase in Protestant terrorist activity. You may wish to ask him whether this is likely to affect the chances of the one or two UDA men (e.g. Mr. Herron) who are standing in the Assembly elections, and whether Mr. Craig will be successful in preventing some of the obloquy from brushing off on his Party. The memorandum also refers to a campaign, already beginning, for the release of prisoners from the Maze. The Secretary of State is probably right in saying that "We cannot go on indefinitely increasing the number of people held". But what alternative does he suggest? And, more generally, does he see any real end to sectarian terrorism in the foreseeable future? If not, what are the chances that the new constitutional arrangements will even get off the ground? The Elections 3. 
The Secretary of State is surely right in warning his colleagues that 
the results of the local elections should not be taken as a reliable guide to the outcome of the elections to the Assembly. The recent JIC report on "The Irish Situation" (JIC(A)(73)(SA)(IR) 31 of 6th June) provides a very useful commentary on this subject. Perhaps its most significant sentence is the statement that "The vote as a whole, however, particularly among Protestants, demonstrated once again the defensive and sectarian nature of Northern Ireland politics". The Secretary of State may well be right, therefore, in predicting that, because many Protestant voters cast their second votes in favour of more extreme candidates, the Catholics (many of whom appear to have given their first vote to the Alliance Party, while many of those who voted for the SDLP did not give their second votes to Catholic extremists) may now follow the Protestant example and move outwards

rather than inwards. Moreover, if (as is probable) voting for the Assembly proves to be higher than for the local elections, this might also work against the interests of the Alliance Party, whose supporters were probably out in full strength for the local elections. 
in short, the outcome of the 
Assembly elections is likely to be more, rather than less, polarised than the outcome of the local elections. 4. 
The Secretary of State concludes that, on this hypothesis, the 
Faulknerite Unionists, allied with the centre Parties (essentially the Alliance) and/or the SDLP, may have a majority, although it might be narrow. But both the Alliance and the SDLP include individuals who are very reluctant to align themselves with Mr. Faulkner (even to the extent, in some cases, of contemplating the possibility of working with Mr. Paisley and Mr. Craig); and Mr. Faulkner may find himself uncomfortably dependent on the Protestant extremists as a result. As the JIC report suggests "... the anti-White Paper Parties could therefore hold a decisive position in the 78 member Assembly; and Mr. Faulkner is likely to react by trying to protect himself from this sort of threat from the right by showing himself prepared to be even more uncompromising in refusing to agree to a substantial degree of power-sharing in the new Executive beyond an adaptation of the Committee system which he attempted to set up in the old Stormont Assembly". If this forecast is correct, the prospects of bringing into being an Executive which would genuinely conform to the terms of the White Paper as reflected in the Constitution Act are not bright. The Secretary of State does not commit himself, very understandably, in paragraph 11 about the action which he would take if the outcome of the elections is unmanageable. 
But is there nothing that we could, and should, 
be doing in the interim in order to try to persuade the local political leaders not to paint themselves into their respective corners in advance of the elections? Legislation 5. 
Meanwhile, the Secretary of State must be right in recommending 
that the Government should refuse, in discussions on the Constitution Bill, to be drawn about the precise type of political alliances which might meet the criteria in Clause 2(1)(b). But does his reference to difficulties about the Border poll indicate that he thinks that some concession might have to be made on this? If so, what? The Committee may also wish to invite him to indicate the areas where there is scope for change in the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill, e. g. three judges instead of one sitting alone.

In Belfast a man was fatally wounded when shot as he charged a sentry at a barrier. The remaining casualties were all a result of a car bomb in Coleraine which appears to have bean abandoned in haste by terrorists before reaching the location for which a warning had been given. 
BELFAST 2. 
SF were involved in 2 of the 3 shooting incidents. Shortly after a 
badly beaten woman sought refuge in RUC Springfield Rd her husband arrived and attempted to attack a sentry with a chair leg. He was shot and fatally wounded after failing to stop when challenged.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 240700 TO 290700 HRS MAY 1973 GENERAL 1. 
During this five day period there have been a total of 43 shooting incidents 
of which SF were involved in 30, there have been 20 explosions, 7 in Belfast, 2 in Londonderry and remaining 9 in the Border and Rural areas. Two members of the SF have been killed, one SI and 5 others injured. Civilian casualties total 3 killed and 13 injured. 
BELFAST 2. 
The period has been comparatively quiet in Belfast. The most serious incident 
occurred on Saturday when fire was opened on a SF patrol in Andersonstown. A young boy playing near the patrol was shot dead by terrorist gun fire. There have been a number of sectarian or punishment shootings and at least one purely criminal murder. The four bombs which exploded in Belfast on Saturday were all aimed at RC pubs and were probably the work of Protestant extremists. 
LONDONDERRY 3. 
The recent high level of stoning and hooliganism in the Bogside and Creggan 
has decreased over the week-end although it has not entirely subsided. There were major stoning incidents on Thursday and on Monday. Two further letter bombs addressed to soldiers in Londonderry have been intercepted and rendered harmless. The Provisional IPA in Londonderry have called for the erection of barricades in Catholic areas of the city on 31 Jul and a one day strike on 9 August. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 4. 
The most serious incidents in the Border and Rural areas have again involved 
sophisticated bomb attacks against SF. In one of these near Crossmaglen two soldiers were killed and one was seriously injured. A second ingenious device in Cullyhanna was rendered harmless by ATO. After an accidental border incursion by members of the SF near Newtownbutler the Gardai proved co-operative and escorted the patrol back to the border.

NORTHERN IRELAND FORECAST OF EVENTS - WEEKEND 18-21 MAY 1973 OPERATION AL SUMMARY 1. 
There has been a rise in the level of Provisional IRA activity during 
the last 2 days. On Wednesday there were 30 shooting incidents and 6 explosions including a car bomb in the area of the City Centre in Belfast. Another car bomb was neutralised. Early on Thursday morning a bomb exploded on the South end of the N/S runay at Aldergrove Airport causing negligible damage. Another similar bomb found nearby was dealt with by ATO. Later in the day the Provisional IRA issued a statement threatening to destroy the airport and aircraft operating from it. In Belfast, on Thursday, there were 3 incidents where terrorist bullets aimed at Security Forces hit or nearly hit civilians. A 14 year old girl died later and 2 others received GSW (one is SI). In Andersonstown there was a claymore type attack on a Security Force patrol. In Londonderry a magistrate was slightly injured when a letterbomb he received through the post exploded when he threw it away: another letterbomb, posted to a councillor in Portrush was intercepted and dealt with. Early on Friday morning 4 senior NCOs were killed when a bomb detonated in their car in a car park outside a hotel in Omagh; another is VSI from his injuries. 
2. Security Force successes in the last 48 hours have included the arrest of 10 
officers and 11 volunteers of the Provisional IRA. Amongst these were the CO of 3 bn Provo IRA and 3 company commanders. 
There have also been good weapons 
and explosive finds. There have been further instances of close co-operation between Security Forces and the Gardai and on Wednesday, following a tip-off from 2 PARA, the Gardai found 3 weapons and 1800 rounds of ammunition.

May 1973 NORTHERN IRELAND FORECAST OF EVENTS - WEEKEND 11-14 MAY 1973 
OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1. 
In General, the level of activity remains similar to recent weeks but three 
soldiers and one member of the UDR have been killed during the past week. It has been a quiet week in Belfast with a significant drop in shooting incidents. In Londonderry the most significant incident was a car bomb within the City Walls on Saturday 
- the first inside the Walls since July 1972; there have, however, 
been fewer instances of hooliganism but the threat from sniper attacks continue. In the border and rural areas terrorist mine and claymore attacks continue and last Saturday three soldiers were killed by explosive devices near Crossmaglen. Rocket attacks, both in Belfast and the rural areas, continue as do bomb attacks on commercial properties, bars and garages. There have, however, been no mortar attacks during the last week. The most significant aspect of the last few days has been the increasing co-operation of the authorities of the Republic in combatting border terrorist activity.

Principles to be Adopted by the Security Forces 7. 
all military patrol activity is to be reduced as much as possible consistent with 3(d) above. In the sensitive areas, combined RMP/RUC patrols are to be instituted wherever possible so as to keep open main routes (in Belfast these are marked white on the revised communities Map). 
8. Protection of the Interface. These are to be controlled by the 
Security Forces to prevent sectarian violence. 9. 
Arrest Policy. Arrest policy during the period of a ceasefire should be 
(a) As regards offences of all kinds committed after the ceasefire, arrests will be made as necessary within the ambit of the normal criminal law - i.e. persona will not be arrested for the purpose of questioning, detention or internment under the Special Powers Act. Legal advice is being obtained on the powers of the Army to arrest. 
(b) The problem of outstanding offences of a terrorist character committed by IRA men who have evaded arrest or skipped bail will require a separate decision. 
(c) A further question which will have to be decided at once is whether any regulations creating criminal offences under the Special Powers Act should be suspended or repealed. 
10. Searches of buildings and property are to be confined to those in pursuit 
of investigation of criminal activities committed after the ceasefire. VCPs will, subject to paragraph 3(d), be progressively withdrawn except at entrances to military bases and at key points and other patented premises. 
11. Altering the Military posture. Other measures that can be taken, as 
circumstances allow, to progressively demonstrate a change in military posture are: 
(a) Vehicle patrols to use Landrovers instead of Pigs as soon as it is judged safe to do so. 
(b) Weapons are to be available but not "at the ready" when on vehicle patrol. 
(c) Flack jackets and helmets where appropriate are to be readily available but not worn. 
(d) Improving the appearance of military bases, particularly in central Belfast. 
Border Policy. All cratering and recrataring activity to cease. No patrols to approach within one mile of the border except on Brigade authority. 
12. Patrolling. With the general exception of major roads and interfaces

4 January 1973 
J T Williams Esq Northern Ireland Office Great George Street London SW1 
Arrest Policy: Protestants Two important decisions have been taken here at Stormont Castle in the last two days. 
2. At the morning meeting on 2 January the Secretary of State expressed anxiety to take some visible effective action to deal with the assassinations. The Chief Constable suggested that if it happened that Protestant extremists suspected of murder or other terrorist crime had to be let go after interrogation by the CID they should be re-arrested under Regulation 11 and interrogated by the Special Branch. The Secretary of State agreed that this should happen and said that if the Special Branch interrogation pointed to the preparation of submissions for interim custody orders he would be quite prepared for this. In principle there is nothing new in this, since the Secretary of State has always said that he would be prepared to detain some Protestant extremists if a proper case were made out. The new element is that some orders for the custody of Protestants are likely now soon to be made. 
3. 
and as not in itself constituting any formal change of arrest policy, since any interim custody orders would be incidental to action taken 
The Secretary of State evidently regarded this decision as a first step against 
suspected murderers and terrorists. He preferred this step to another suggestion, made by the GOC, that the RUC should re-examine, with a view to the making of custody orders, the list of the 50 or so men apprehended and released at the drinking club in the Shankill on the famous night when Gusty Spence, along with the greater part of the command structure of the UVF, was alleged to have slipped through the fingers of the security forces. 
4. The Secretary of State said that he would also look again at the five 
specimen cases recently submitted to him of Protestant extremists who might be made the subject of interim custody orders. What he had in mind was that if it were possible to put two or three bad men inside as a result of investigations into their being suspected of murder or other terrorist crime he might at the same time make orders on another two or three Protestant extremists on the basis of information about their activities not necessarily related to specific criminal incidents. These latter two or three might be from the five specimen cases. He has since looked at these specimen cases and decided that there would be good grounds for making custody orders in at least two cases. (It does not follow that orders will in fact be made.) 
5. The second decision was taken at the morning meeting on 3 January, when 
arrest policy was formally considered on the basis of Army papers 113G of 9 December and 12 December. The decision was that the present arrest instructions are amended with immediate effect by the introduction of a

J T Williams Esq 4 January 1973 new sub-paragraph as follows. 
"Other terrorists who are known, on the basis of a joint intelligence assessment, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, end for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an interim custody order." 
These words are to be inserted as a new paragraph (e), so that the arrest instructions will now read from (a) to (f) as in the annex to this letter. 
6. This annex reproduces the relevant part of Annex B to HQNI document 
1104G of 7 December 1972, which is the Commander Land Forces’ Directive for Future Operations. This is an important document, which we should obtain for our files, if we have not got it already. (I had not myself previously seen it.) The arrest instructions as embodied in Annex B to document 1104G, ie even before this latest amendment, are I think slightly different from the latest version known to us in the NIO in London; paragraph (b) has an extra sentence. The purpose of the new paragraph (e) is to make it possible to proceed against Protestant terrorists. There is, of course, no intention of announcing that there is a new arrest policy or an arrest policy in relation to Protestants. Indeed the Chief Constable was most anxious that only a very limited distribution should be given to the new instruction. He will himself inform only a very small number of people in the RUC and the GOC said that the Army would likewise limit distribution. It is possible thus to restrict the circulation of the formal instruction and nevertheless to act on it because of the words "on the basis of a joint intelligence assessment". This means that the security forces will only proceed under this paragraph against named terrorists and with the approval of the Secretary of State or one of the other Ministers. It was stated quite unequivocally at the meeting that it is intended to proceed under this paragraph only with the approval of a Minister in each case. 
7. I do m t know how much of the foregoing will be reflected in the minutes 
of the meetings; but it is clearly desirable that we should be fully informed about it in London, because of our share of the responsibility in relation to policy on arrest and detention and so that we can keep our end up in relations with the Ministry of Defence on these issues. 
8. Copies of this letter are being left behind here for Jack Howard-rake 
and for the files here; but I am not sending a copy to anyone outside the Northern Ireland Office. The Ministry of Defence will no doubt hear about all this on their own net.

ARREST INSTRUCTIONS (REVISED) 
a. Anyone against whom there is known to be evidence to justify the preferring of criminal charges. b. 
Anyone against whom there s thought to be evidence which might, after 
questioning, justify the preferring of criminal charges. If it emerges, during questioning, that an arrested person cannot be charged, then irrespective of whether he is a member of the Provisional IRA, consideration will be given to a possible application for an interim custody order, where the grounds appear to be sufficient. c.

though there is no evidence to justify criminal charges. d. 
Provisional IRA volunteers, who, on the strength of reliable 
intelligence, are known to be an exceptionally serious threat to security. e.

assessment, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an interim custody order. f.

arresting soldier suspects him of having committed or being about to commit an act prejudicial to peace.

1. SECURITY REVIEW The GOC and Chief Constable reported a generally quiet 24-hour period. 
The Secretary of State agreed to the establishment of a joint RMP/RUC Task Force in Londonderry on the lines of that already operating in Belfast. 
To counter allegations of lack of activity on the part of the security forces in relation to recent murders in Belfast it was decided that the Information Service might release news about the establishment of a separate control room for the Task Force in Belfast. 
Arising out of a discussion about the interpretation of the word "illegal", Lord Windlesham asked Mr Harris and Mr Macmahon to co-operate in producing a short brief on the application of the term to organisations and their uniforms. 
2. ARREST POLICY (Resumed Discussion) 
The meeting had before it HQNI Paper 1113G of 12 December, para 7(e) of which would have been modified by the decision taken at the Secretary of State’s meeting of 13 December (SSM (72) 118 Item 2). 
The GOC said that subsequent discussions between his HQ and NIO Belfast had revealed that the proposed modification would have introduced unforeseen difficulties. After further discussion it was agreed that the sub-paragraph should read as follows:"Other terrorists who are known, on the basis of a joint intelligence assessment, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an Interim Custody Order." 
The meeting noted that the Army Paper was intended for limited distribution and took the view that no suggestion should be made in any quarter of any fundamental change being made in arrest policy.

Sir William Nield It was agreed at the Secretary of State’s morning meeting on Wednesday 
13th December that I should discuss further with the Army the exact wording of paragraphs 7(b) and 7(e) in the attached document. 2. 
On sneaking to the Chief of Staff I was surprised to find that there was 
still uncertainty in the Army about whether they wanted the new paragraph 7(e), as amended at the Secretary of State’s meeting, to be circulated now or to be held in reserve. They have discussed this among themselves and at the request of the RUC have come up with the slightly odd idea that the paragraph should not be circulated until, as they put it, "the dossiers are available". I do not understand what the relevance is of this but for the moment have merely agreed with the Chief of Staff that we will talk again about it when the dossiers are in fact available. The subject will no doubt come up when the "test case" is considered next week. 3. 
The Army would prefer to make a further amendment to the amendment which 
you proposed at the meeting and they now wish paragraph 7(e) to read as follows: "Other terrorists who are known on the strength of reliable 
intelligence, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an interim custody order. The persons and categories to whom this applies will be specified from time to time." 
4. 5. I see no objection to this. I discussed further with the Chief of Staff the second sentence of 
paragraph 7(b). He explained that it had been included in the revised CLF directive on the grounds it reflected the instructions in the Secretary of State’s letter of 6th November in which he said: "In view of recent developments, Protestant terrorists may fall to be dealt with under the new order. It is not possible at the moment to define the categories which I will be prepared to consider for interim custody and for the time being I will consider applications in respect of them on their merits."

6. I think this is fair enough and is in fact quite useful since it covers 
the point the Secretary of State has made that he would be prepared to consider signing interim custody orders against any Protestants who were arrested on the basis of their possible implication in murder but against whom it was not possible to prefer charges.

7. Regulation 11. This is chiefly used when a person is suspected of 
having committed an offence in the field of law and order but there is a brook in time between the alleged commission of the offence and the apprehension of the suspect. The appropriate formula from paragraph 6 of the Blue Card must be used. Additionally persons in the following categories are to be arrested under Regulation 11 powers:- 
a. Anyone against hom there is known to be evidence to 
justify the preferring of criminal charges. b. 
Anyone against whom there is thought to be evidence which 
might, after questioning, justify the preferring of criminal charges. If it emerges, during questioning, that an arrested person cannot be charged 
consideration will be given to 
a possible application for an interim custody order, where the grounds appear to be sufficient

e. Other terrorists who are known, on the strength of reliable 
intelligence, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, 
Interim Custody Order. f. 
Anyone in the company of a person arrested "red-handed" 
(see paragraph 3 above) if the arresting soldier suspects him of having committed or being about to commit an act prejudicial to peace. 
8. Soldiers may wish to question a passer-by, e.g. as to his identity 
and recent activities, even though his behaviour gives no grounds for suspicion. This is permissible if it is done on the spot or very close by and the questions are reasonable. There is no power to require a person to leave the immediate area and go to a military post for this questioning unless he is lawfully arrested. If an answer is given which causes the soldier to suspect the person of falling into one of the categories in paragraph 7 above, he should arrest him under Regulation 11 of the SPA, remembering to use the appropriate formula from paragraph 6 of the Blue Card. If the answers given do not raise a sufficient suspicion to justify arrest he must be allowed to go on his way immediately. If however the passer-by refuses to stop or to answer the questions he is committing an offence against the SPA Regulations and the soldier can arrest him under Regulation 11 of the SPA on that ground.

having committed an offence in the field of law nd order but there is a break in time between the alleged commission of the offence and the apprehension of the suspect. The appropriate formula from paragraph 6 of the Blue Card must be used. Additionally persons in the following categories are to be arrested under Regulation 11 powers:-

If the answers given do not raise a sufficient suspicion to justify arrest he must be allowed to go on his way immediately. If however the passer-by refuses to stop or to answer the questions he is committing an offence against the SPA Regulations and the soldier can arrest him under Regulation 11 of the SPA on that ground.

ARREST POLICY FOR PROTESTANTS (PAPER BY COC) 1. 
a. 
are to arrest, in addition to persons caught red-handed in the act of committing an offence, persons in the following categories:- 
The Army’s present arrest instructions provide that soldiers Anyone against whom there is known to be evidence 
to justify the preferring of criminal charges. b. 
c. d. e. Anyone against whom there is thought to be evidence 
which might, after questioning, justify the preferring of criminal charges. 
Anyone known to be holding officer rank in the 
Provisional IRA even though there is no evidence to justify criminal charges. 
Provisional IRA volunteers who, on the strength of 
reliable intelligence, are known to be an exceptionally serious threat to security. 
Anyone in the company of a person arrested "red- 
handed" if th arresting soldier suspects him of having committed or being about to commit an act prejudical to peace. 
2. From this it will be seen that arrests are linked to the prospect of bringing criminal charges, except in the case of categories c. and d. - 
ie. Provisional officers and certain 
volunteers. 3. 
The policy does not therefore provide for the arrest of 
Protestants or other non-Provisional terrorists except with the object of bringing a criminal charge. Protestants are not, as the policy stands, arrested with a view to their being made subject to Interim Custody Orders (ICOs) and brought before the Commissioners. The Secretary of State has indicated that in individual cases he will be prepared to consider on their merits applications for Interim Custody Orders in respect of Protestants, but such applications for Protestants will only arise where a person who at the time of arrest is thought to be criminally chargeable turns out during questioning not to be chargeable. 
4. Ministers have judged that the time is not at the moment 
ripe for an extension of the arrest policy in respect of Protestants. The object of this note is however to suggest a form of words which can be incorporated in the Arrest Policy Instructions when the time comes for such an extension. 
5. 
is very difficult to lay down precise criteria to define those Protestant terrorists who should be arrested. With the 
It 
exception of the UVF, Protestant extremist organisations are not in themselves illegal; it is not therefore possible to regard all those holding certain defined positions in Protestant organisations

as dangerous terrorists, as we regard officers in the Provisional IRA. 
6. It is suggested, therefore, that a category defined along the following li 
to be arrested:- 
"Other terrorists (as specified from time to time by the Secretary of State) who are known, on the strength of reliable intelligence to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an Interim Custody Order." 
7. Minor amendments to categories e and d would be required 
if, as the result of an end to the Official IRA’s ceasefire, Official IRA members were once again arrested with a view to detention. 
8. It could be argued that the UVF, which like the IRA is an 
illegal organisation, should be singled out for special treatment. To possibilities are:- 
a. To provide that all members of the UVF are to be arrested. 
b. 9. To provide that persons holding officer positions in the UVF are to be arrested. 
of all members of the Provisional IRA, and it would be illogical to go further in the case of the UVF than we do in the case of the IRA. The arrest of officers in the UVF is a more realistic option; but it is doubtful whether the intelligence available in their cases is sufficient to support applications for Interim Custody Orders, or subsequent Detention Orders by the Commissioners, except of course where a UVF officer falls anyway within the category defined in paragraph 8 above. 
The present arrest policy does not provide for the arrest 
10. The arrest instructions will, in any case, require overhaul when the awaited improvements are introduced to the law on membership of illegal organisations in order to remove the present difficulties in securing convictions. In practice, the references to "criminal offences" in the present arrest instructions have not been taken to include membership of an illegal organisation; otherwise the Army would be bound to arrest all members of the IRA (Official as well as Provisional), UVF, etc. Even if the law is amended effectively, there ill be strong reasons on practical as well as political grounds for not arresting everyone who commits the offence of membership of an illegal organisations; presumably members of the Official IRA will be excluded.

COMMANDER LAND FORCES’ DIRECTIVE FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS 
References: A. 
B. 0. 
Our 1104 G dated 27 July 1972. 
Our Internal Security Instruction 2/72 dated 27 July 1972. NISSIs 1971. 
SITUATION Background 1. 
In my Directive dated 27 Jul 72 (Reference ’A’) and 
promulgated by Internal Security Instruction 2/72 (Reference ’B’) I gave you the mission to establish a continuing presence in all hard areas in order to dominate the IRA and Protestant extremists and thus neutralise their ability to influence events. 
Although 
Phase 3 of Operation Motorman, the build up of intelligence and the removal of key terrorists from circulation, is still in 
progress, vigorous and successful action by the Security Forces has seriously reduced the IRA’s morale and made most encouraging inroads into their command structure. Neutralisation has not 
yet been achieved but great progress has been made. However, 
further political and military factors have emerged which together now necessitate the redefinition of the Army’s role and tasks for the future. 
New Factors 2. 
new factors is the reduction in force levels in December to 18 major units in the infantry role. 
From the military viewpoint, the most important of the In Belfast there will 
be enough troops to cover the hard Catholic areas and the interfaces but our presence in Protestant areas will be minimal. In Londonderry our presence in the Bogside and Creggan will be reduced so that hooliganism may well increase, particularly in the Creggan. 
In the rural area our presence will have to remain at a mere subsistence level with the result that 
public confidence, particularly in Fermanagh and possibly in Areas O and P, may be low and intimidation a major problem.

3. The next most important new factor is the emergence of extreme Protestant militancy which, coupled with the reduction in our force levels, will mean an increase in the relative strength of our opponents both in terms of numbers and geography. These organisations are likely to spend the winter months organising, planning, training and acquiring arms. 
There 
can be little doubt that they have the capability to become a danger as great or even greater than the IRA. 
4. With the development of Protestant militancy and their 
increasing fear that unacceptable political concessions will be made to the Catholics, attitudes will harden and intersectarian strife leading to intimidation by both sides will increase. 
Real and imagined threats to isolated members 
of each community, including those in the border areas, will become more widespread so that a more general polarisation of the communities is likely to take place. 
5. Although the publicity given to the CESA announcement that 
they will form vigilante patrols is out of proportion to the potential strength of that organisation, it remains to be seen what effect they will have on the security situation. 
6. 
reception by most shades of moderate opinion, excited extremists of both sides. 
The recently issued Green Paper, has despite its good It provides a clear indication that the 
forthcoming months, during which we will see the Plebiscite and publication of the White Paper, will be a period of increasing hostility. 
Although outwardly the security 
situation may appear to become more stable, it will be potentially explosive. 
7. 
from the majority of moderate Catholic opinion and their probable wish to conserve and build up their strength for possible reaction to the White Paper, increases the possibility of their declaring a cease-fire. 
Our successes against the IRA, their increasing separation The approach of Christmas could provide them 
with a plausible excuse. 8. 
their handling of the propaganda war. 
Also, it is clearly apparent that because of our recent Our opponents are skilled and unscrupulous in 
themselves ready and able to make something out of very little and will search diligently for any opportunity to exploit. We must therefore take particular care not to provide them with an opening. 
They have shown 
and increasing successes, the IRA propaganda effort is being stepped up.

12. Although this hirective aUr:rtncrea’;ng tnInthe Sonths ahead, it is essential that the Province should not erupt and that the White Paper is presented in the best possible olimate, 
We aust ensure that the extremists on both sides are 
isolated so that the great bulk of moderate opinion will prevail. The publication of the White Paper will be a vital step in IIGts ffoi towards the political solution, and it is our military task to ensure that it is launched on a public who are in the most suitable mood and circumstances to receive it. 
13. The IRA remain the root cause of the security problem so that our actions must be primarily directed towards their defeat. 
Our actions are, however, to be carefully balanced 
so that no unnecessary irritation is caused to the bulk of the law-abiding Catholic population. 
14. Serious attrition of the IRA will, to a large extent, out the militant ground from under the extreme Protestants so that political progress can more easily take place. 
15, The task of law and order enforcement is ultimately for the police rather than the Army, 
The Army, in the closest 
support of the police, must therefore aim to reduce the extent of intimidation exercised by extremist organisations and so encourage reconciliation between the communities. 
This in 
turn will allow political progress so that, in due course, the situation will be restored and the police will no longer require the permanent support of the Regular British Army.

Attitudes and Discipline 
(1) The conduct of the Army continues to be a factor of great importance in the task of depriving extremist elements of the support of the majority of the moderate population, thus leading to a reconciliation between the communities which will in turn allow unhindered political progress. 
The Army must be seen to be 
courteous well turned out and well behaved, and to obey the laws of the land in such matters as traffic discipline including speed limits and lighting regulations. 
Army vehicles are distinctive and 
plentiful so that any breach of the law is quickly noticed. 
(2) In addition, the Army’s impartiality between religious denominations must be absolute and our attentions directed at law-breakers of whatever religion. 
In executing our task, the minimum force necessary must be the guiding rule.

as possible. As at present it will help me in considering each application 
if it is accompanied by a factual statement of the 
reasons why a detention order is considered necessary, indicating inter alia the extent to which the individual concerned is currently actively engaged in terrorist activity and the possibility of criminal charges being preferred. The practice whereby special Branch officers are available to explain the background of each case should continue, and it may be helpful on occasion if an Ary representative is also available to discuss the case. To this end a copy or the Special Branch submission should be sent to Headquarters Northern Ireland. 
You will know that it is my intention to seek the agreement of my colleagues to new procedures which in the event or internment being brought at an end will make It possible to keep in custody those members of the IRA whose continued liberty is a threat to security. The arrangements which I describe above are therefore on interim measure pending further consideration of alternative procedures and amI 
accordingly anxious that there should be no sudden large-scale increase in the number of detention orders. 
I hope therefore that 
thee will be kept to the minimum compatible with the needs of the security situation. 
This letter should be read in conjunction with the documents on 
arrest policy and on interrogation which Howard-Drake sent you with his letter of 16 August. I am sending a copy of this to Graham Shillington.

o.c. Sir William Wield Mr Woodfield Mr Platt 
Mr Howard-Drake Wanted List It is interesting to note that category III of the wanted list, which 
is defined by the RUC as: "Those holding key positions in terrorist organisations who are known to be responsible for the direction and performance of acts of violence by others, but against whom there is no evidence or intelligence of personal involvement" contains only 31 names. The Secretary of State’s warnings about the difficulties of further 
large scale internment and detention have clearly been taken to heart and as a result the list seems to have been carefully sifted to include only key figures. The list contains 11 Official IRA and presumably their inclusion will have to be reviewed if that organisation decides to continue its ceasefire. Category III contains no Protestant extremists.

D J Trevelyan Esq Northern Ireland Office London 
Thank you for your letter of 9 June about the "wanted" list and the arrest and prosecution of IRA leaders from the South. These were discussed at JSC(0) last week, and no doubt you 
will have seen the minutes; paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 refer. (The particular arrests on 5 June had been discussed the week before, when we drew the Army’s attention to the embarrassment which could be caused by their emphasising the standing of IRA figures whom they arrested.) Both the Army and the RUC took the view that their instructions to personnel should ensure that only the more important terrorists, or those who were likely to be charged, were arrested; they also considered, however, that it was right to maintain a full list of suspects, not as "wanted" people but in case the information should be required at any time or in any particular area. 
The Committee accepted that this was reasonable, and I do not think that we can press the point any further for the time being. As to the arrest of IRA leaders from the Republic, we did pass your message 
of 2 June to the Chief Constable the same day. But at JSC(O) the RUC representatives took the view that there was very little prospect of gathering evidence against these men which would be likely to satisfy the courts, and as you say the use of Regulation 10 and 11 in these cases presents obvious difficulties.

March, 1972 IRA TACTICS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
The IRA employs three main weapons in its campaign in Northern Ireland: the stationary bomb, the missile bomb and small arms. 
the target Whatever - and the IRA now tends to avoid well-defended military targets, 
seeking instead to cause destruction and casualties in civilian areas bombs are inevitably indiscriminate; and the organisation has shown scant regard for innocent parties when opening fire with small arms. 
uses a crowd as cover. All in all, its tactics are causing an increasing 
number of deaths among the civilian population. Most of the bombings and shootings in Northern Ireland are the work 
of the breakaway Provisional wing of the IRA whose declared aim is the disruption of life to such an extent that the province becomes ungovernable. It regards the deaths of women and children with equanimity. 
The death of 
18-month-old Angela Gallagher, killed by a terrorist’s bullet in the Falls Road area of Belfast on September 3, 1971, was described by Mr Rory Brady, Chief of Staff of the Provisional IRA, as "one of the hazards of urban guerrilla warfare". 
the IRA, which, despite its stated preference for political methods, does not eschew violence. 
of the 16th Parachute Brigade in Aldershot, England on February 22, 1972, caused the deaths of five women domestic workers, a civilian gardener and a Roman Catholic padre. 
Stationary bombs The use of gelignite bombs against public buildings is the main 
feature of the IRA’s current campaign. These are intended to achieve 
the propaganda effect of an explosion, the disruption of normal life, the destruction of strategic targets and the intimidation of the organisation’s opponents. A subsidiary purpose is to draw security forces into the open so that they become a target for snipers. 
suggests that their main use is as a terror weapon, or for propaganda purposes. 
The placing of bombs in public houses, hotels, shops and offices The improved security arrangements around strategic targets 
have to a large extent forced the IRA to seek other ways of trying to show that its capacity for destruction is unhampered, and the majority of deaths and injuries from bombings occur among the non-active population. 
Two 
of the more vicious attacks occurred on August 25, 1971, when a bomb placed in a locker room at the Belfast office of the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland killed one man and injured 30 office girls; and on January 26, 1972, when a 100 lb. bomb sent to the partly completed Belfast Telephone Exchange in Grosvenor Road was discovered only minutes before it exploded. 
The latter put at risk 30 or 40 of the 100 people 
working in the building. The use of gelignite and the lack of properly designed time fuses 
and safety devices make the bombs unpredictable. By giving warning 
that they have been placed, the IRA hopes to escape too much censure, but since they often explode prematurely such warnings tend to be useless. An instance of this occurred on December 4, 1971, when 15 people died in McGurk’s Bar in Belfast. 
The balance of incidents is supplied by the Official wing of The bombing by the Official IRA of the officers’ mess

NOTE ON INTERROGATION 1. The general rules governing the custody of detainees and the processes of 
interrogation have been reviewed from time to time by the Government Departments and agencies concerned in the light of experience gained in the various internal security operations in which HMG have been involved since the last war. The techniques of interrogation currently in use have also been employed in many previous internal security situations. The latest instructions on the rules to be followed were issued in 1965, and were revised in 1967 to provide for the daily inspection by a medical officer in the light of the recommendations in the Report on the Aden situation by Mr Roderic Bowen QC issued in November 1966 (Cmd,3165). 
2. 
These general rules include the following safeguards: a. 
b. c. Subjects to be seen daily by Medical Officer, 
The following are prohibited: (i) violence to life and person, in particular, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; 
(ii) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment. 
d. Subjects are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline. 
(These rules follow the broad principles for the treatment of persons under arrest or detention during civil disturbances as laid down in Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949).) 
3. The precise application of these general rules in particular circumstances 
is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the part of those immediately responsible for the operations in question. Intelligence is the key to successful operations against terrorists; and the key to intelligence is information regarding 
Medical examination nd record of weight of subject on admission and discharge.

terrorists; and the key to intelligence is information regarding 
their operations, their dispositions, and their plans. When combating a terrorist campaign time is of the essence; information must be sought while it is still fresh so that it may be used as quickly as possible to effect the capture of persons, arms and explosives and thereby save the lives of members of the security forces and of the civil population. 4. 
InforMation can be obtained more rapidly if the person Being 
interrogated is subjected to strict discipline and isolation, with a restricted diet; 
but violence or 
humiliating treatment, as explained above, are forbidden. Equally any person undergoing interrogation must be assured of security against either violent treatment by his fellow detainees or recognition by them; the evidence of IRA vengeance against informers underlines the importance of this safeguard. 5. 
These objectives may involve the use of the following methods, 
the circumstances and duration of whose application may vary according to the staff and accommodation available at the interrogation centre and the length of time for which detainees may be left alone or must be kept together:a. 
Wall Standing Requiring detainees to stand with their arms against a wall but not in a position of stress provides security for detainees and guards against physical violence during the reception and search period and whenever detainees are together outside their own rooms in a holding room awaiting interrogation. It also assists the interrogation process by imposing discipline. 
Although the security need for this technique could be reduced by an increase

DRAFT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER Sir Edmund Compton has now reported to the Home Secretary. His 
report is being published as a White Paper and is now available in the Vote Office. Sir Edmund’s verdict is that allegations of brutality agaist the 
security forces are not substantiated though he has examined them with meticulous care. 
He does, however, consider that in the case of a small 
number of individuals who were interrogated there was physical ill-treatment, though not serious enough to inflict physical or mental injury. 
Full 
details are given in his report. The techniques of interrogation used have been employed on a number 
of occasions in the past in dealing with terrorist compaigns. occasion was in Aden in 1966. The last On that occasion the then Government asked 
Mr. Bowen to carry out an enquiry, which was published as a White Paper. Subsequently in 1967 revisions were made to the safeguards under which these techniques can be used. These safeguards include provision that there should be no brutal or 
humiliating treatment and that there should be constant medical supervision to guard against mental or physical injury. On this occasion (a) 
the principles and safeguards were fully observed

the principles and safeguards were in general observed, but in some particulars they were exceeded. 
In the battle against any terrorist organisation intelligence is 
of fundamental importance to success. These interrogations was designed to, and succeeded in, obtaining a great deal of information about weapons and explosives and those who intended to use them for the murder of soldiers and policemen and the bombing of public places with loss of human life. 
activities have been severely curtailed. There is here clearly a difficult dilemma. 
As a result these On the one hand the 
need to protect the public against terrorism; on the other hand to ensure that methods of interrogation are kept within the bounds of humanity. Important issues of national security are involved. 
I have thought it 
right, therefore, after-consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, that a Committee of Privy Councillors should be appointed to consider the limitations imposed by the interrogation techniques and other ways in which they can be clarified, and if necessary, amended.

NORTHERN IRELAND The Secretary of State held a short internal meeting 
at 3.15 yesterday afternoon in preparation for a meeting of GEN 79 later in the afternoon. CGS, PUS, DUS(ARMY) and AUS(GS) were present. The following main points were discussed. 
General Situation 2. 
CGS, who had just returned from Northern Ireland, 
said that there was considerable unease there lest no solution emerged from the proposed political talks and the Security Forces found themselves in a weaker position by the end of the year. 
Preventive Detention 3. 
CGS said that there were differing views in Northern 
Ireland on arrest policy and on what to do with those who were arrested. It was noted that a case could be made for the introduction of preventive detention as being preferable to internment without trial; but legislation would be required, and S of S judged that this would present Parliamentary difficulties which would prevent early action. It was agreed that there would be advantage in pursuing other legal measures (proscription of terrorist organisations, stricter control of unlicenced vehicles etc.), which did not require Parliamentary action. It was agreed that the Cabinet Office paper on legal issues which was under preparation should make clear the distinction between these two categories. (I should be grateful if AUS(GS) would take action on this). 
Internment 4. 
CGS reported that the Secretary of State for Northern 
Ireland was anxious that all those at present interned should be released. The Army’s view was that this would not be disastrous, provided that the possibility of interning those who were arrested in future was kept open. S of S doubted whether this was realistic; the SDLP could hardly be expected

5. Minister of State said that he was content with the 
Part III Instruction as amended and agreed that they should be retained for future use, should Ministers decide that the Services should take part in interrogation. 
6. 
was that suspects should be taken to local police stations for primary interrogation and then moved to one of three police offices for secondary interrogation if this were required. 
The concept of interrogation which was supported by GOC NI At police 
offices the Army would provide Intelligence Corps clerks to carry out the essential tasks of collating and co-ordinating the data obtained by RUC/Special Branch interrogators. 
7. Should tertiary interrogation be needed, it should be carried 
out at a central specialist establishment. 8. 
and of the Part III Instructions for Army administrative back-up to RUC interrogators. 
The NIO had been sent a copy of the MOD Part II Directive The NIO did not, however, intend 
to issue these instructions because they seemed at present content to rely on the JIC paper and were not pressing for the establishment of the police offices. 
taking this up with GOC NI and it was agreed that if the police office system was not established shortly, it might be necessary for Minister of State to approach the SS NI. 
Preventive Detention 9. 
a paper prepared by Sir William Nield calling for a system of special courts to ensure that those suspected of being terrorist could be held in detention on the basis of evidence, which might not be acceptable to the normal courts of law. 
DUS(Army)reported that the Cabinet Office were looking at GOC NI felt 
strongly that some such system was essential but it was clear th the lawyers were most unhappy. 
An attempt was therefore bei 
made to go some way towards this concept within the framework o existing legislation, to extend SS NI’s existing power to hold men for up to twenty-eight days for further questioning. 
10. Minister of State agreed that an effort should be made to find a more 
effective method of proceeding, within the framew 
of existing law, and to consider writing to the Attorney-Gene to keep the pressure up on the lawyers.

done strictly within the Judges Rules; 
and iii. the Police further consider that, in the particular case, obtaining ouch information or intelligence is relatively more important than trying to secure a conviction, 
then the questioning - in this case, of course, by the Special Branch - some lesser criteria. 
c. may be conducted within 
The main requirement in this latter case should be that the questioning is in all respects legal. (The Judges Rules procedures are designed to ensure admissability rather than legality.) 
d. 
The procedures and methods to be used by the Special Branch should in any event be no less stringent than those laid down for any future military interrogation in the directive which is now in course of being approved (post Parker). 
e. 
When questioning has been conducted to this lower standard, we must accept that in most 
confessions have been obtained will not be admitted in evidence in any subsequent proceedings. 
that MOD would be unlikely to dissent if they were later adopted as firm policy. It is clearly in the Army’s interest that the Special Branch should be no more circumscribed than is necessary in their ability to obtain vital and urgent intelligence from suspected terrorists. Hence we would be reluctant to see them held strictly to the Judges Rules. At the same time we must obviously agree that the Special Branch should be given no greater latitude than the Armed Forces will themselves have if and when 
3. While Minister of State will not wish to c omit MOD irrevocably to supporting these propositions only tentative as yet - 
military interrogation is undertaken in future; for MOD to argue otherwise would be absurd. Moreover, it is in the Army’s interest that suspected terrorists should 
not only reveal 
information but should also, as far as possible, be kept out of circulation; if internment is in future to be available only exceptionally - if at all - for this purpose, then it becomes important for us as well as for the civil authorities that as few prosecutions as possible founder because the accused’s confession has been obtained by means which totally rule out its admissability. Therefore the nearer that Special Branch can keep

during the hours of daylight might with advantage have been used far more frequent1y 
than was the case. Such small parties might have involved some risks, but the risks were more apparent than real, becuase the tactics of the I.R.A. were to ambush parties on the move when they did not expect attack, rather than to attack a party however small which was in

well chosen. The areas suitable for observation were the mountainaous and sparsely inhabited areas usually regarded as being quiet simply because they were not occupied by the Crown Forces.. In towns observation of suspected houses was equally necessary, but more difficult 
position. In most cases such a party of well all provided their position was 
to carry out. A stationary observer was bound himself to be noticed before long, a group of observers was obviously impossible and to make a quick and accurate reconnaissance while passing a house involves considerable skill and much training. Such reconnaissance was, however, carried out with success, especially in Dublin. during the period under review: Self-contained and independent parties of about twelve moving about the country 
either in plain clothes (when they could move during the daylight) or in uniform (when their movement was by night) and travelling either on foot or in Ford cars did obtain information of value. Iad more troops been available this form of activity might have been developed with advantage both from the point of view of " Operations " and 
" Intelligence." Here, again, it may seem that an unjustifiable risk would be involved. The occupants of two Ford cars, however, arrested some 40 I.R.A. officers and killed their commandant when he tried to escape ; while a party of one officer and 13 other ranks fought an action lasting nearly six hours with four different rebel columns, each estimated at about fifty, and retired successfully after inflicting heavy casualties. These are instances of what was achieved by small parties. 
The possibilities of personal investigation depended on various factors. If an 
intelligence officer were well known in his area it was very difficult. In any case, he had to have a capacity for mixing with all classes. In the curious conditions which prevailed there were many forms of sport which continued during 1920 and 1921 and it was possible to pick up information both in the hunting field and at race meetings. Farmers were often willing to make friends even with officers and voluntarily or nvoluntarily told them much that was of interest. Some officers successfully passed themselves off as officers of the I.R.A. and obtained information of great value. This it need hardly be said not only demanded at times courage of rare quality but always required exceptional local knowledge. 
(vi) Secret Service.-Secret Service was on the whole a failure in Ireland. For 
many reasons it was practically impossible to place a man in any inner circle. For Irishmen, the risks of discovery and of its consequent results were too great ; the Sin Fein movement was so general, the proportion of Irishmen outside it so small, and any stranger in a country district so suspected that consistent, regular and unsuspected informers, such as had been employed on other occasions, were almost unobtainable at any price. The desire to inform for the sake of informing, which is such a common characteristic among secret service agents, was conspicuous by its absence. For Englishmen the work was exceedingly difficult and dangerous. Their accent usually betrayed them. If they wanted to get into inner circles they had to become moreextreme than the extremists, in which case they ran a reasonably good prospect of being shot at any moment by the Crown Forces. The Civil Government hoped and intended at one time to flood Ireland with agents. 
The case of Belgium was quoted. There the Germans were faced with a network of spy systems, and information was passed to the Allied Intelligence services over the Dutch border without cessation during the years 1914-18. It was at first overlooked that the Crown Forces in Ireland, and not the Sinn Feiners, were in the position of the Germans opposed by national movement. Soon it was realised that such a scheme was impracticable and the efforts of the police intelligence were concentrated on Dublin, 
where, however, the vicious plan of allowing parallel systems of secret 
service to work simultaneously in the same area was encouraged. In spite of this remarkable results were achieved. Probably the most successful organisation was one consisting mainly or ex-officers who worked in plain clothes-mostly in the street. They suffered heavy casualties and it was hard to get and train recurits; 
for a school which was started in England way discontinued, and later recruits had to receive their 
training actually in the course of their " operations," thus increasing the risks both to themselves and those who were teaching them. Many otherwise suitable recruits

Following it the draft of a statement to be televised by 
Mr. Faulkner and issued. Begins. 
1. If Northern Ireland is to survive and prosper, two things 
are essential. We must sustain a continuing programme of economic and soial development, and we must find the means to create a more united society here 
- one in which all men of 
good will, however divergent their legitimato political views may participate to the full. These things are, and will continue to be, the aims of our policy. 2. 
Neither will be possible in a climate of terrorism and 
violence. The outrages to which we have been subjected now threaten our economic life and create every day deeper divisions and antagonism within our community. These, indeed, are the clear objects of those who carry them out. 3. 
Every means has been tried to make terrorists amenable to 
the law. Nor have such methods been without success, because a substantial number of the most prominent leaders of the IRA are now serving ordinary prison sentences. But the terrorist campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthless viciousness. 4. 
I have therefore decided, after weighing all the relevant 
considerations, including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with HMG in the UK last Thursday, to exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as Minister of Home Affairs. 
5. Accordingly, a number of men have been detained by the 
security forces at various places in Northern Ireland this morning. I will be making internment orders in respect of such of these men as constitute a serious and continuing threat to public order and safety. This will be done only after a careful scrutiny of information furnished to me by the police in respect of each ouch person, sufficient to convince me that the individual in question is a threat to present peace and maintenance of order. Any such person will then have the right

of life and security of property in Northern Ireland. At all times I have consistently emphasised that it was not a step towards which I would be moved by any political clamour. Equally, I cannot now allow the prospect of any misrepresentations to deflect me from my duty to act. 
7. This is not action taken against any responsible and law- 
abiding section of the community. Nor is it in any way punitive or indiscriminate. Its benefits should be felt not least in those areas where violent men have exercised a certain away by. threat and intimidation over decent and responsible men and women. 8. 
The main target of the present operation in the Irish 
Republican Army which has been responsible for recent acts of terrorism, and whose victims have included Protestant and Roman Catholic alike. They are the present threat: but we will not hesitate to take strong action against any other individuals or organisations who may present such a threat in the future. 
9. It is with understandable reluctance that one uses these 
exceptional powers, but the organisations concerned are those which have murdered in cold blood, created situations which have led to death or injury to people quite uninvolved in disorder, maimed numerous people including young children and put at risk the jobs and the whole future of entire communities. I ask those who will quite sincerely consider the use of internment powers as evil to answer honestly this question: Is it more of an evil than to allow the perpetrators of these outrages to remain at liberty? I cannot guarantee that the action we have now taken will bring this campaign swiftly to an end. We may yet have much to endure as a community: but if we endure it with courage and steadiness, the utter defeat of terrorism is sure.

11. I am sorry that this decision will inevitably interfere 
with rights and tradition cherished by many people, but I must ask all concerned to accept it as truly necessary in the vital interests of the country. We are, quite simply, at war with the terrorist, and in a state of war many sacrifices have to be made, and made in a co-operative and understanding spirit. 12. The action we have now taken does not indicate any policy of repression. We are acting not to suppress freedom, but to allow the overwhelming mass of our people to enjoy freedom including freedom from fear of the gunman, of the nightly explosion, of fire-raising, of kangaroo courts and all the apparatus of terrorism. The rest of us cannot truly be free while people determined to commit such outrages are at large. 
13. In particular, I want to say a word directly to my Catholic fellow-countrymen. I do not for one moment confuse your community with the IRA or I imagine that these acts of terror have been committed in your name or with your approval. I have always had great respect for the god-fearing people. Albeit with political views different from my own - I have met in every part of Ulster. I respect the way in which your religious leaders, and many of your public representatives, have outspokenly condemned violence as immoral. We are now acting to remove the shadow of fear which hangs over too many of you. I appeal to you to come out and join us in building this community up again: not to restore it simply to what it was, for many of us in the past have failed each other, but to build it on better, sounder and stronger lines. Unless you take the place in our community which awaits you, all of us will be the losers. My door is open to an y of your leaders, political or religious, who want to discuss how we can now move forward. 
14. Over the last couple of year we have taken many steps to make it clear that we want (following word underlined) all the people of Northern Ireland to play a part in administering and developing the country. But neither changes in law nor changes in administrative structures can unite his community until we

that the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland will very shortly be announcing that, in the light of the latest assessment of the security situation in Northern Ireland and all. other relevant factors, and after consultation with the British Government, the Northern Ireland Govern ment has decided to activate its powers of internment so as to enable the security forces to arrest and detain people suspected of responsibility for committing or abetting acts of terrorism and other breaches of the peace designed to lead to a breakdown of law and order in Northern Ireland.

I regret no less than you that these new measures 
have been found necessary. I hope that, in the light of wh I have said, you will be able to react to them with understanding, even if with regret. Our hope. certainly is that they can be strictly: temporary, and will serve to reestalbish a situation in which the many social and other reforms that have been introduced are recognised at their true value, and progress can again be resumed on the task of building more harmonious inter-community relations in Northern Ireland. 
10. And above all I hope that this will not be allowed to affect the good relationship which you and I have established, and the close relations between our two. countries on so many matters of importance to us both: and particularly on entry into the European Communities. 11. I am much looking forward to your visit in October, which will give us an opportunity to discuss the. whole range of matters of interest to us both.

Protestants as well as Catholic and I.R.A., 
extremists will be liable to internment; and the marches due in Derry on 12 August and in Belfast at the end of the month will not take place. 8. 
A little time ago, I was in touch with Mr. Lynch 
to try to discover whether he was contemplating the possibility of internment south of the border, if we were forced to. it north of the border. Clearly that would have added to its effectiveness; but out discussions shoved that there was no possibility of parallel action south of the border. 
Have sent a further message tQ 
Mr. Lynch, asking him to react with understanding; even if with regret, and emphasising that we hope that these measures can be strictly temporary, and will serve to re-establish a situation in which we can get back to the task of making progress with building more harmonious inter-community relations in Northern Ireland. I had already invited Mr. lynch to come over here for meetings in October, for a general discussion on the whole range of matters of interest to us both, and I hope very much that that arrangement will be able to stand.

INTERNMENT: NORTHERN IRELAND 1. 
I feel you would wish to be aware that the DIS has NO hard 
intelligence that the parade in Londonderry on the 12th is likely to attract any greater terrorist activity than was foreseen last week or indeed at any time in the past before such a parado. 
stepping up trainig in the South this week; 2. In support of the above I can report:- 
a. there is NO sign of any unusual increase in IRA strength (either faction) in Londonderry up to today; nor have we any knowledge of IRA plans to reinforce their units in that city. 
b. Nor do we have any intelligence suggesting firm plans for protestant activity by any extremist group such as the Ulster Volunteer Force. 
3. As recently as 2 August 1971 the Director of Intelligence 
made a formal assessment reporting that if the parade was banned the Protestants would regard it as a major sell-out to the Republicans: there was consequent talk of serious disorders if this should happen. The Director further reported that Republican are publicly advocating the need for plans to be made for "disruptive activity", should internment be introduced. 
4. In sum, I have NO new intelligence indicators to support the view that the Apprentices Boys March is now more likely than we have previously judged to result in danger to life and limb lot alone that it will be a "blood bath". Such a risk as you well know inevitably exists, but there has been nothing over the last few days suggesting any dramatic change for the worse. 
We do know from one CX report that Bradyites may be we do recognise 
that there is a state of increased sectarian tension; but all this is completely true to form in such circumstances.

General Tuzo was asked whether he thought the.Apprentice Boys’ March should He said that he thought it would be easier to have a controlled 
march than to attempt to ban it. There was a risk that extreme Protestants 
would come out or to .tho streets and perhaps use the rifles they had hidden away.. Mr. Smith suggested that if the activity of the army as in proposed swoops could be presented as a major now drive against the IRA it might be possible to call upon the Protesants to give up their march without too drastic a reaction. General Tuzo agreed that the question of banning should be considered again closer to the occasion. The Home Secretary said that Mr. Faulkner had suggested the cratering of 
roads on the border. General Tuzo said that this was a waste. of tie. Any farmer with a bulldozer could fill in the crater and such measures had no security value to balance the ill-will they created amongst the border population. If, however, it were thought politically desirable, blowing holes in roads was technically not a difficult operation for the army. 
Mr. Smith stressed that 
although cratering might temporarily please Unionist opinion, views would change hen it became apparent that cratering was ineffective and the security forces ould be open to ridicule. 
The Home Secretary said that, although the security 
advantages might be meagre, this appeared to be a matter to which Mr. Faulkner attached political importance and he found it attractive for that reason. General Tuzo mentioned that it was intended to put a stronger charge behind The Home Secretary said that he had been disappointed that

5. The possible grounds are two-fold: the potential need fo 
an Internment camp an an instrument of the fight against terrorism to which both HMG and the Stormont Government are 
committed; and the alternative use of the buildings as accommod tion for British troops. 
6. As to the first point, it is almost inconceivable that a 
decision to intern would be taken by the Northern Ireland Government without consultation with HMG at Westminster. 
Like 
Major Chichester-Clark, Mr. Faulkner has stated that he would only contemplate internment if the Security Forces advised in favour of it. 
But in any event, to retain under the full control 
of HMG in Westminster the premises necessary if internment is to be physically put into effect, both in the short term solution (Maidstone) and the long term (Long Kesh), is a powerful means of ensuring that the Westminster Government retains a major, if not indeed a predominant, role in such a decision. 
situation the decision to intern would of course lie with the Westminster Government alone. 
7. The second ground - troop accommodation - needs to be examined 
against the background of current and projected force levels and the means of housing them. While long term force levels are postulated at 5 major units in the infantry role (all subsequent calculations in this submission are on the basis of infantry requirements), medium term requirements have been estimated at 10, with a possible need to increase this level to 12 or more for particular periods 
- e.g. the marching season. 
direct rule would probably increase the force level requirement significantly. 
approved, this would be likely further to increase the overall accommodation requirements. 
8. To meet these requirements there will be permanent accommoda- 
tion for 4 accompanied major units by June 1971, when the Army take over the RAF accommodation at Ballykelly; permanent accommodation for a fifth, unaccompanied, major unit is planned for completion (at Aldergrove) by the end of 1972. 
9. generally of a temporary nature. 
The rest of the accommodation, available or planned, is It includes the old barracks 
at Armagh and assumes the continued availability of the accommodation ship MAIDSTONE. 
While it includes modern huts of temporary 
construction, it excludes two hutted training camps which are essential to the training needs of the large garrison and for the UDR and TAVR. 
in disused factories, hangars the Long Kesh site - 
At the bottom end of the scale troops are living - there is such accommodation at 
and, at times of peak force levels, tents.

d.. Women Prisoners. The reconnaissance party were advised by Director of Intelligence that they might expect up to 50 women prisoners and the plans being drawn up include provision for women. 
e. Segregation of Types. The team were advised that it 
would be desirable to provide for the segregation of prisoners by type i.e. IRA, Protestant extremists, etc, and have included this in their plans. This will, of course, increase administrative difficulties. 
f. Dogs. The recce party are including a kennels and 
accommodation for 12 guard dogs and their handlers on Home Office advice. It is not clear who will provide these, and this requires looking into. 
g. Fire Fighting. The nearest fire brigade to the site is 
at Lisburn. This is run on a volunteer part-time basis. Provision is therefore being made for the accommodation of trailer fire fighting equipment to be operated by members of the camp staff. Home Office advice is needed as to the minimum requirements within the camp itself. 
h. Alarm Systems. The Home Office expert advised that 
a Tannoy system should be provided for the whole camp. Home Office confirmation in this is needed. 
Construction Time 7. 
The engineer first estimate is that the camp for 450 could be built by 
three field troops all free to work (i.e. not tied to provision of or accounting for stores), in three months from the work go. This would include time to move stores to Ireland. Thus internment accommodation could be arranged as follows:- 
a. Short Term. Maidstone following whatever work is 
advised by the Naval engineer for the first month, during which time construction at Longkesh would be started. 
b. Medium Term. The construction at Longkesh would be 
so arranged that accommodation would become progressively available. After one month it might be possible to start moving internees from Maidstone to phase one of the camp construction. This would provide accommodation for the second and third months after the decision to intern was taken. 
Camp Staff. Guidance is urgently required as to.

ANNEX A TO DOIC/200/INT DATED 7 JUL 70 
General and Political 1. 
The sombre events of the past fortnight have demonstrated anew the intractable nature o the problem in Northern Ireland - the suspicion, fear and hate 
which divide the communities and lead their more militant members into orgies of blind, destructive rioting. 
Once again the major disturbances occurred in 
Belfast and Londonderry (although the causes differed in the two cities) and in the areas where Protestants and Catholics live their separate lives in crowded enclaves. 
tension increased and there were comparatively minor confrontations and incidents. 
2. On the political side the period under review has seen the reaffirmation by 
the new Conservative Government at Westminster of the bipartisan policy of support for the Chichester-Clark Administration in Northern Ireland with its unqualified commitment to implement the reform programme outlined in the joint communiques of last autumn; the provision of adequate funds to enable the Province to develop economically; and a renewal of the assurance of a continuing British military presence in Northern Ireland for as long as conditions make it necessary. 
These 
assurances were given by the Home Secretary during his brief fact finding visit to Belfast on 30th June and 1st July, and were 
confirmed in the debates which 
followed at Westminster on the Queen’s Speech. 3.

Unionists as proof of their deep-seated conviction that the Army could not effectively replace an armed Police Force operating with the USC, and was too ponderous and hesitant in its reaction to the attack to be able to assert effective control over the City area. 
The events in Belfast of the weekend 26th-28th June, reported elsewhere in They were regarded by many 
Unionist back-benchers exerted pressure 
in the Administration for more energetic enforcement of law and order. Responding to this dismay in their own ranks the Administration rushed through a bill at Stormont providing for mandatory sentences of imprisonment on persons convicted of riotous conduct - 
there had been legitimate concern felt over the 
trivial sentences imposed by some Courts for participation even in major riots. 5. 
The Catholic leadership both political and ecclestiastical have reluct- 
antly accepted the need for Government to reassert its authority by dealing condignly with law breakers, although many of them in public associate themselves with the outcry against the severity of the Army’s action. 
inevitably, there have been cases of distress among the innocent and there have been renewed accusations of partiality from the Catholics. 
Regrettably but (Complaint s 
about the conduct of soldiers during the Falls Road operation are now coming in) The rest of the Province escaped major trouble though in many towns

Arson and looting accompanied the fighting and reached a climax on the Saturday night with the firing of two large warehouses, the looting of several shops, two pubs, a liquor warehouse (with the help of a bulldozer) and the pillaging and wrecking of the Bogside building site, which will mean the temporary cessation of the building programme at a time when the end of the housing problem was in sight.

Nw that the General Election is over, interest in the Orange celebrations Protestant fears of restrictions on the Orange July 
processions and meetings seem to have been allayed and there is no doubt that they will seek to demonstrate their ascendancy in Northern Ireland in face of what they regard as Roman Catholic and Republican encroachments on their position during the past year. 
They expect some kind of Republican reaction 
during the celebrations and will be prepared to meet violence with violence, though there is no evidence that they have any deliberately offensive plans of their own. 
So far the various Lodge banner transfers, usually involving 
processions, have occurred without major incident but an Orange march in Dungiven nn 14th June would undoubtedly have developed into serious trouble if the Lodge had not agreed to a re-routing of the procession, and if the Army and Police had not been deployed in very substantial numbers.

The Joint Intelligence Committee (A) approved a background paper 
on the IRA (JIC(A)(70)(N)106) on 9th July, which has been circulated. 
The Home Office has not received in the meantime 
any concrete information which conflicts with the conclusions of that paper, but the JIC has already commissioned a threat assessment on Northern Ireland which should be completed within the next week or so. This will pay particular attention to an analysis of those factors suggesting IRA involvement described in HONIP(70)32, paragraph 7. 2. 
As recorded in the JIC background paper, the Provisional Army 
Council (Brady faction) probably out-number the "official" IRA (Goulding faction) in Northern Ireland by about 2:1, with the possible exception of Londonderry. The internecine rivalry between the two factions may not now be as vicious as it was a few months ago, but it is still acute. Discussions that have been held between the two factions have not as yet led to the co-ordination of policies. In particular, we have no reason to believe that the leadership of either faction is planning any major campaign of confrontation with the security forces in Northern Ireland. However, the Brady faction is known to favour individual incidents of violence to keep things on the boil, and there are clear indications that the Goulding faction might be prepared to join in. 3. 
Our strong impression is that IRA activity in Northern Ireland 
this year has so far been the work of small groups who may owe allegiance to one of the two factions, but who have acted largely on their own initiative, without any formalised central control. The main lines of IRA activity have been as follows. Incitement and exploitation of harassment of the security forces by hooligans 4.

5. The satisfactory manner in which potential trouble in Londonderry on 
12th August was dealt with has for the time being strengthened the Government’s hand in its dialogue with its right-wing critics in the Parliamentary Party. At a meeting of this group on 13th August, there was apparently no opposition to Major Chichester-Clark’s leadership, and no serious criticism of his Government’s policies.

in which to demonstrate to the community and particularly to their supporters their determination to take adequate measures in the law and order field s as to enhance their credibility as a Government. 
Their decision announced on 
14th August to block up certain unapproved roads across the Border in Co Armagh is an example of this. 
7. The rioting in Belfast which egan on 30th July had spent itself by 5th 
August but on that evening Londonderry began to erupt and during the next four nights there were constant attacks by the Bogside youths on the Army accompanied. by the erection of barricades, arson and some petrol bombing. 
Explosions and 
malicious fires were reported from various parts of the Province but mostly in Belfast and the south-east, although the electricity sub-station in Magherafelt, Co Londonderry, was badly damaged by a gelignite explosion on the afternoon of Sunday, 9th August. 
The climax occurred on the night of 11th August at 
Crossmaglen, Co Armagh, within a mile of the Border when two RUC constables died while examining a stolen car which exploded when its door was opened. 
It is 
estimated that there must have been at least 15 lbs of gelignite in the vehicle. Belfast 8.

15. It would appear therefore that we are faced with a revival of the 
traditional type of attack on members of the Security Forces and prominent Northern Ireland personalities and sabotage of Government buildings and public utilities planned and carried out by groups or individuals acting independently. Trans-border raids and ambushes are likely. 
In fact an eight-man IRA unit 
was in position on the Eire side of the Border near Clady, County Londonderry, hoping to ambush a British Army patrol early on 4th August. A mobile Eire Army patrol surprised them and one man, Thomas Carlin of Londonderry, was captured in possession of a FN rifle, an automatic pistol and plenty of ammunition. 
The others escaped. leader of the operation was a Bradyite from Cork.

pressure from hardline Unionists to enforce "law and order" by which they really mean punitive action against Catholics. 
The fact that these same people 
encourage or acquiesce in illegal Protestant processions is conveniently ignored. 
Further defiance of the ban may lead to Republican counter demon-

Neither faction of the IRA has as yet given any indication of its The Goulding Group, particularly, took punishment and lost face 
There was a poor response to the appeal by NICRA for Province-wide 
protests last weekend against the action of the Army in the Falls. Approximately 500 people paraded in Newry and 250 in Omagh on 11th July. A parade scheduled to take place in Derry on the same day was cancelled. The NICRA hierarchy is obviously disappointed at these turnouts and although it is expected that they will persevere in holding meetings during the coming weeks they have obviously lost much public support. 
Outlook 12. 
Although the long awaited and feared Orange 12th July celebrations are 
safely behind us, there can be no complacency about the security situation in Northern Ireland, as is evident from the subsequent bomb explosions. There is a temporary relaxation of the tension but the Orange marching season is not yet over, and the political situation is still unstable. 
The possibility of Important decisions, 
which will undoubtedly create excitement, have to be made about the control of forthcoming events in the Orange calendar, particularly the Apprentice Boys’ celebrations in August; the reintroduction of normal policing in the troubled areas of Belfast and Derry; and arms searches. 
further attacks on commercial and Government buildings cannot be overlooked, nor can other forms of terrorist activity.

12.30 P.M. THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 1972. THIS DOCUT IS ISSUED IN ADVANCE ON THE STRICT UNDERSTNDING THAT NO APPROACH IS MADE TO ANY ORGANISATION OR PERSON ABOUT ITS CONTENTS BEFORE THE TIME OF PUBLICATION. 
THE SCARMAN REPORT The Scarman Report on tho violence and civil disturbance in 
Northern Ireland in 1969 published today says there was no plot to overthrow tho Government or to mount an armed insurrection. The Report says that neither the IRA nor any Protestant 
organisation, nor anybody else, planned a campaign of rots. There were communal disturbances arising from a complex political, social and economic situation. (Para 24). There wore however planned acts of violnce by both extreme 
Protestants and by republican elements and the attack on Crossmaglen RUC police station in August 1969 is hold to be an IRA operation which, if it had succeeded, would have led to the murder of a number of innocent people (para 3 -7) and serious damage to private property. The Royal Ulster Constabulary is f ound to have made serious 
mistakes in six incidents including the use of armoured cars fitted with browning machine guns. But the Report stresses that the great majority of the members of the RUC were concerned to do their duty, to maintain order on the streets, using no more force than was reasonably necessary to suppress rioting and protect life and limb. It rejects the accusation that the RUC was a partisan force 
co-oporating with Protestant mobs to attack Catholic people. The Report says the charge "is devoid of substance and we reject it utterly" (para 3 -2). Of tho USC the Report states that there are no grounds for 
singling out mobilised USC as being guilty of misconduct although when used for riot control outside Belfast they showed on several oooaaions a lack of proper discipline particularly in the use of firearms (paragraphs 3 -23 and 24). The Report states that the USC were neither trained nor equipped for riot control duty (paragraph 3 -11).

The following is a summary of the Report: 
PART 1 - GENERAL SURVEY Chapter 1 traces the course of events in Northern Ireland 
from June 1968 to the commencement of violence in March 1969. These events were the subject of the Report of the Cameron Commission. CHAPTER 2 - THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE DISTURBANCES The Scarman Tribunal records that it is possible to reach some 
general conclusions as to the origins and nature of the riots and other disorders which disturbed the province in the Spring and Summer of 1969. It is the judgment of the Tribunal that there was no plot to overthrow the Government or to mount an armed insurrection. There were acts of violence which wore planned howevr, such as the explosions at the public utility installations in March and April 1969, which are regarded as the responsibility of extreme Protestants concerned to undermine confidence in Captain O’Neill’s administration and the bomb attacks on the Belfast Post Offices in April, which are regarded as having been planned by republican elements as a diversionary tactic to relieve the Bogside and the attack on Crossmaglen police station in August, which is regarded as an IR. operation planned and carried out from a base in the Republic. The Report records however that the riots were a different 
matter and that neither the IRA nor any Protestant organisation nor anybody else planned a campaign of riots. These were communal disturbances arising from a complex political, social and economic situation. (Paragraph 2.4). The Report records that there is no evidence to implicate the 
leaders of the political opposition (paragraph 2.9) and states that Dr.Paisley’s role in the events under review was fundamentally similar to that of the politcal leaders on the other side of the sectarian divide (paragraph 2.15). In both cases public utterances by these politicans are regarded as a contributory factor in the building-up of tensions: in neither case is there evidence of implication in violence. In the case of Miss Bernadette Devlin, she is regarded as having a degree of responsibility once the disturbances had begun for encouraging Bogsiders to resist the police with violence, but the Report records that they had no evidence that she was a party to any plot to subvert the State or stir up insurrection.

On the general situation, the Prime Minister r. Faulkner ad indicated that he did 
not wish to be called to London until after a meet of the Ulster Unionist Council, to be held on 3 March, for fear of giving Mr. Craig and other extremists material for criticism of the Northern Ireland Government. This made it impossible for the Home Secretary and himself to talk to Mr. Faulkner until the following week. This made for complications in relation to a possible Debate in the House of Commons.

true that that campaign was intensified in the months following the introduction of interment. Regrettably also, some of the active opposition to internment and much of the misrepresentation about its use have encouraged terrorism. 
The alienation of many elements in the Roman Catholic community 
and the polarisation of Catholics and non-Catholics to which your message refers are sad indeed and much against the general public interest. Security policies will inevitably be resented in those sections of the community in which are found those deemed to be working against the security of the whole community. There may well result a real belief on the part of some that the working of such policies is an attack on the rights of a minority. It is sadly true, however, that this belief, although mistaken, is actively fostered by others. 
The call of your Conference for the ending of internment is 
based on the claim that it has not worked. His Excellency is advised that it has been increasingly effective in its original purpose of removing subversive organisations from areas in which they previously held sway, so that there now are areas in Belfast and elsewhere in which it is more tolerable to live because there are no longer organisations there to terrorise the people of those areas. Those who are freed from intimidation, however, do not in general articulately proclaim the fact. The point must also be made that there are some who do not wish internment to work but who wish to see subversive organisations succeed in their aim of procuring constitutional changes that are contrary to the wishes of a majority in the community. 
His Excellency’s Ministers strongly contest the suggestion in 
your message that there are now "in Stormont’s terms an additional 5,000 members of the minority qualified for interment". This is perhaps a suggestion that people are interned because of their political views. The Prime Minister has publicly stated and repeated that persons are interned solely because they are deemed to be members of, or actively associated with, subversive organisations. 
Where 
the Advisory Committee have been satisfied that an internee does not fall into this category they have so recommended and that man has been released. If, on the other hand, the statement is intended to mean that internment has brought 5,000 recruits into the ranks of subversive organisations, this also must be contested. Recent arrests have shown clearly that most of those now active in such organisations were recruited before August 1971, when internment was introduced.

I THE MAJORITY REPORT 
OUR APPROACH 1 
"Terrorism" no doubt connotes violence, and violence for political ends. 
This could arise under normal conditions, in which case those suspected of such conduct would be dealt with in the same way as any other persons suspected of crime. 
our inquiry ordinary police interrogation. 
We do not, however, construe our terms of reference as including in We have accordingly confined our 
inquiry to interrogation in circumstances where some public emergency has arisen as a result of which suspects can legally be detained without trial. 
2 We also read our terms of reference as calling upon us to inquire quite 
generally into the interrogation and custody of persons suspected of terrorism in such circumstances in the future, and not specifically in connection with Northern Ireland. 
In particular, we are not called upon to consider afresh matters already dealt with in the Compton Report (Cmnd Paper 4823). Further, 
while in our view the use of some if not all the techniques in question would constitute criminal assaults and might also give rise to civil proceedings under English law, we refrain from expressing any view in respect of the position in Northern Ireland in deference to the courts there, before whom we understand proceedings which raise this issue are pending. 
3 As our inquiry progressed it became clear that the only "procedures 
currently authorised", in the sense of authorised by the civil power, were such as could be said to comply with the Joint Directive on Military Interrogation of 17 February 1965 (JIC(65)15), as amended in 1967 as a result of the Report of Mr Roderic Bowen QC (Cmnd Paper 3165). 
A note summarising the rules of this 
Directive was published in paragraph 46 of the Compton Report but for the sake of accuracy we set out in the Appendix such extracts from this Directive as are immediately relevant to our inquiry. 
4 It will be seen that this Directive, though dealing with Internal Security 
operations, refers to Article 3 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949) and then sets out the principles contained in that Article. 
However, that Convention, Convention No III, deals with international 
warfare and the more apt Convention is Convention No IV, dealing with internal civilian disturbances in which Article 3 is in the same terms.

WHAT WERE THEIR EFFECTS? 12 
It is necessary to consider this in some detail. The situation in Northern 
Ireland is one in which members of the Irish Republican Army are conducting a campaign of terror which includes brutal murders, arson, the use of explosives against innocent men, women and children and outrages of all kinds. 
There is 
virtually a war going on between the Government of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republican Army and in this conflict the lives, not only of innocent civilians but of the police and army, are at stake in circumstances of appalling difficulty for the members of those forces whose courage, resolution and behaviour are all so well known. 
It has been submitted to us that because these things are so - and in my opinion 
they are so - the procedures were necessary to obtain, for the purpose of saving lives, information which could not otherwise have been obtained or alternatively not obtained so quickly, that they are therefore morally justifiable, that the same may well be so in future conditions of emergency elsewhere and that the procedures with such amendments as may be thought desirable, should remain available. 
This raises questions, including moral questions,which cannot be determined without considering the effects of the procedures on the obtaining of intelligence information, on the detainees, on the relations between the forces of law and order and the people of Northern Ireland and on the reputation of the United Kingdom. 
13 Their effect on the detainees Their immediate effect was on the detainees. 
physical effects and the mental effects. (a) 
Physical effects (i) 
It would seem unlikely that the procedures would not result in some minor physical injuries. 
11 men made complaints of physical 
ill-treatment and some of them who had no injuries on arrival at the interrogation centre were found by the Compton Committee to have had minor injuries when they left. 
We have had to consider both the Like the Compton Committee 
we have not seen any of the detainees and, like them, we cannot say how these injuries were occasioned. 
(ii) 
We have received unchallenged medical evidence that subjection to a noise level of 85 decibels (at the interrogation centre it was 85 to 87 decibels) for 48 hours might result for 8% in temporary loss of hearing and in 1% (with ear disorders) in some permanent loss of hearing.

19 The real question at the end of the day, therefore, is whether we should 
recommend that Parliament should enact legislation making lawful in emergency conditions the ill-treatment by the police, for the purpose of obtaining information, of suspects who are believed to have such information and, if so, providing for what degree of ill-treatment and subject to what limitations and safeguards. 
20 I am not in favour of making such a recommendation for each of the following 
five reasons: (1) 
I do not believe that, whether in peace time for the purpose of obtaining information relating to men like the Richardson gang or the Kray gang, or in emergency terrorist conditions, or even in war against a ruthless enemy, such procedures are morally justifiable against those suspected of having information of importance to the police or army, even in the light of any marginal advantages which may thereby be obtained. 
(2) 
If it is to be made legal to employ methods not now legal against a man whom the police believe to have, but who may not have, information which the police desire to obtain, I, like many of our witnesses, have searched for, but been unable to find, either in logic or in morals, any limit to the degree of ill-treatment to be legalised. 
The only 
logical limit to the degree of ill-treatment to be legalised would appear to be whatever degree of ill-treatment proves to be necessary to get the information out of him, which would include, if necessary, extreme torture. I cannot think that Parliament should, or would, so legislate. 
(3) 
Our witnesses have felt great difficulty in even suggesting any fixed limits for noise threshold or any time limits for noise, wall-standing, hooding, or deprivation of diet or sleep. All our medical witnesses agreed that the variations in what people can stand in relation to both physical exhaustion and mental disorientation are very great and believe that to fix any such limits is quite impracticable. We asked one group of medical specialists we saw to reconsider this and they subsequently wrote to us

COMMITTEE ON INTERROGATION PROCEDURES 
The Rt Hon Edward Heath MBE MP Prime Minister 
6 December 1971 Very many thanks for your letter of 2 December. I did so 
appreciate what you said in the last paragraph. The Committee have now met and have considered the terms of 
reference as given by the Home Secretary in the House of Commons and as set out in your letter to me of the 18 November. 
covering ordinary police inquiries into crime. 
We are a little concerned that some might read these terms as Terrorism no doubt 
connotes violence and violence for political ends but this might occur under ordinary conditions, e.g. violence by some body such as the Angry Brigade. 
We feel sure that you do not intend us to cover police 
interrogation under ordinary conditions but only interrogation under emergency conditions short of war such as prevail in Northern Ireland, e.g. where persons can be lawfully detained without trial. 
In these circumstances we would welcome a slight amendment to make the terms read as follows: 
"To consider whether, and if so in what respects - under conditions in which persons suspected of terrorism can be lawfully detained without trial in the traditional Courts - the procedures currently authorised for the interrogation of such persons and for their custody while subject to interrogation require amendment." 
This is, I fear, a little cumbersome but we have tried to keep as 
far as possible to what the Home Secretary said. If however any difficulty might be thought to attach to an amendment, 
we would be quite prepared to act on the original terms, stating in our Report what our understanding of them is 
coincides with your understanding. The Lord President has kindly agreed that we may use his office as 
an accommodation address and has provided notepaper. - always of course on the assumption that this

D/HOC/18/1 
MA/VCGS The Intelligence Co-ordinator DGI 
AUS(GS) BGS(Int Secretary, JIC Mr. Howard-Drake, Home Office 
EVIDENCE TO THE PARKER COMMITTEE The Intelligence Co-ordinator held a meeting this morning which 
the Secretary of the JIC, BGS(Int) and I attended, to consider the main points which he should make to the Parker Committee when he first appears before them and to identify the issues on which decisions will be needed before his first appearance. 
The Co-ordinator’s opening evidence 2. 
In general terms the line which the Co-ordinator proposes to 
take in his opening evidence is first to explain the need of the security forces for accurate and fresh information in any campaign against terrorists. He will emphasise that the information must be obtained quickly if it is to be of any value and that this recuirement for speed is the major difference between interrogation conducted by or on behalf of the Army and interrogation by the civilian agencies who do not normally have to work against time. 
3. The Co-ordinator will also mention that a further difference 
between military and civilian interrogation is that the former is normally carried out in field conditions where there is often a possibility of external attack and thus of interrogation being interrupted, whereas civilian interrogation can be carried out in a completely secure environment. 
4. The Co-ordinator also proposes to point out to the Committee 
that a steady flow of accurate, up-to-date information from interrogation is important not only for the immediate successes against the terrorists which it leads to but also for the effect it has on the morale and cohesiveness of the terrorists who know that information about themselves is being given by their erstwhile colleagues to superior forces to use against them. 
5. 6. The Co-ordinator then intends to say something about the dilemma 
of devising methods of interrogation which are effective in producing information but which are acceptable in a democratic society. 
This will lead on to the present rules for the conduct of 
interrogation, and the Co-ordinator will have to make clear that these are general rules only which give guidelines to those responsible for carrying out interrogation. Within these guidelines detailed practices are used which have been developed over the years largely on the basis of our experience in successive emergency situations abroad (on which the Committee will have a background paper now being

A history of interrogation since the war in three self-contained parts:- 
(i) 
A history of interrogation used in various post-war emergencies in a terrorist situation where military intelligence has conducted interrogation or worked with the police on interrogation and with other civilian Intelligence Services, 
(ii) A history of the development of the doctrine of Intelligence and training in interrogation at Ashford .

successes achieved by interrogation in the postinternment phase in Northern Ireland.

PUS’s Group will wish to consider whether all 
these papers should be submitted to the Parker Committee and whether there are any others that should be made available. In particular a decision is needed on whether the Co-ordinator should volunteer his report on interrogation methods of 5 November 1971 at an early stage or whether he should wait and see whether the Committee ask him what his views on methods are and then offer it. The dilemma here is that on the one hand to volunteer it might appear to the Committee to be an attempt by the Government to steer them to a particular conclusion, whereas not to offer it straightaway but to produce it at a later stage might suggest that we had been deliberately holding it back. My own feeling is that we should volunteer the report early on, making it clear that this was a domestic study which was carried out when we knew what Compton was likely to say but before we knew that there was to be an enquiry by Privy Councillors

drawing up the original principles in 1965. The Prime Minister said that the principles were contained in a document produced by the Joint Intelligence Committee which would be made available to Lord Parker. Certain changes of detail had been made in the light of the Bowen recommendations in 1967. It seemed that records of interrogation in terrorist situations in former colonies were not now available; they were either in the possession of the special Branches of the countries concerned, which were now independent, or had been destroyed. 
Lord Parker asked who had been responsible for Lord Parker said that he assumed that the 
Committee’s terms of reference were general and were not confined to Northern Ireland. The Committee could then accept the Compton Report as information, and go on to look at the general principles. 
The Prime Minister confirmed that this was so. 
The Committee would, however need to go beyond consideration of the principles themselves, which were probably unexceptionable and consider the methods used in implementing them such as hooding, standing against a wall etc. One of the problems was the degree of urgency in a terrorist situation, where there was a need to get information quickly in order to save lives. 
Lord Parker said that a certain amount of hard- 
ship or discomfort (he preferred to avoid the phrase "physical illtreatment") was bound to arise in a situation of emergency.

SPEAKING NOTE FOR MINISTERS COMPTON REPORT: ARMY AND RUC VINDICATED In speaking about the Report of the enquiry into allegations against 
the security forces of physical brutality in Northern Ireland arising out of the events of the 9th August, 1971, the following points might be made 
1. All charges of brutality against British troops and the RUC were demolished. Sir Edmund Compton’s Committee reported that it found no evidence of brutality, still less of torture or brain washin-. The great majority of allegations are either found not to have been proved or to have been untrue. 
2. The allegations examined by the Committee fell into two classes: those relating to the initial arrests and a small number concerned with the later process of interrogation. Arrests 
- 342 men were arrested on August 9 in a highly successful 
operation in very difficult circumstances. No force but the minimum necessary was used to achieve arrest. The men concerned were likely to resist arrest and many of them were likely to be armed; in these circumstances the army’s performance was highly creditable. 
Interrogation - Interrogations are carried out by the security forces upon principles laid down under the previous administration and confirmed by the present administration. 
Very difficult 
issues are involved in judging what methods of interrogation are permissible in the protection of the lives of the civil population and the security forces against a ruthless and deliberate campaign of terror and murder. 
That is why the Government has appointed 
a committee of Privy Councillors under Lord Parker to enquire into them and see whether changes are necessary. 
3. The whole operation, arrests followed by the interrogation of a small number of suspects (14),yielded information of great value without which the security forces could not defend the ordinary civilian against the campaign of terror and murder. 
4. The operation should be seen against the background of the fight against a ruthless and murderous enemy; that is to say criminals who ish to impose their will by violence and terror. This year there have been over 800 bomb explosions in Northern Ireland; hospitals have treated nearly 600 victims of violence; of these more than 200 were British soldiers; almost two thirds of the civilian casualties were women including girls disfigured for life in explosions. These things have been done by the IRA.

the enquiry which Lord Parker has agreed to chair. Scope of the Enquiry 6. 
As the Home Secretary announced on Tuesday 16 November, the 
scope of Lord Parker’s enquiry will be to consider whether, and if so in what respects, the procedures currently authorised for the interrogation of persons suspected of terrorism and for their custody while subject to interrogation require amendment. 7. 
The enquiry’s precise terms of reference can be settled in 
consultation with Lord Parker. Security 8. 
It will be necessary to give the Committee classified informa- 
tion in the course of their enquiry. There is of course no difficulty about giving them access to such material in the personal sense: this was one reason for deciding to have a committee all of whose members have taken the Privy Counsellors’ oath. But it will not be possible for the Committee to publish any classified evidence they may receive in their report. With this one proviso, however, the Committee should write their report with publication in mind. 9. 
It will be necessary to show Mr. Harold Wilson the complete 
text of the report, including any passages cut out of the published version for reasons of security. Background Information 10. 
Departments have already begun to prepare for the Committee 
papers dealing with the historical development of interrogation procedures as used by the Services in operational conditions and with the kind of results which interrogation in depth produces. These will be ready early next week. The paper setting out the present rules governing the conduct of interrogation already exists and can be made available to the Committee as soon as they are ready to receive papers. 11. 
The Committee would probably find it helpful if very early on in their enquiry they have a discussion with the Intelligence

ill-treatment or hardship. I think the House on studying the Report will conclude that the operation, which was one of considerable difficulty and danger, was accomplished in a highly creditable manner. I made it clear to the Committee on the day they wore appointed 
that their terms of reference included complaints of physical brutality in respect of a small number of men arrested on 9 August who were interrogated in depth after a detention order had been made against them. The purpose of this interrogation was to obtain vital information about the terrorist forces and their stocks of arms and explosives. In these cases also the Committee found no evidence of physical brutality or of torture or brain-washing. They did, however, conclude that some of the procedures involved physical ill-treatment. Full details are given in the report. The principles applied in the interrogation of suspects in 
Northern Ireland and the methods employed are the sane as those which have been used in other struggles against armed terrorists in which Britain has been involved in recent years. HMG consider however that it would be right now to review them. Very difficult issues are involved in judging what methods of interrogation are permissible in the protection of the lives of the civil population and the security forces against a ruthless and deliberate campaign of terror and murder.

29 January, 1971 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 23 - 28 JANUARY, 1971. Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL SITUATION 1. 
The responsibility of Republican extremists for the 
disturbances in Ballymurphy (reported in last week’s HONIP) contrasted with the events, beginning on Friday night, when the Protestant Shankill resorted to violence. It is not thought that the Protestant disturbances were organised by extremists but that, irritated by the Ballymurphy riots, the acquittals in the murder and firearm trial of the Roman Catholic defendants and the defeat of their football club, they took to the streets spontaneously. The numbers involved were never so great, nor the situation so serious, as last September, when the Shankill erupted in somewhat similar circumstances (see HONIP(70) 40, paragraphs 2 to 6). 
2. The main interest during the week has centred on political 
events. Sensing, perhaps, a widespread discontent with the handling of the Ballymurphy disturbances, the right-wing dissident Unionists decided that this was the time to requisition a special meeting of the Unionist Council to consider a resolution calling for the resignation of the Government. The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland has not so far made any public comment on this development and he succeeded in holding off the hard-liners of the right in Wednesday’s debate on "law and order". The terms of the motion, which was in favour of the Government, illustrate, however, that the Primo Minister will continue to be under pressure from his supporters to take "tough" action against troublemakers. Lord Carrington and Mr. Sharples left for a two-day visit to Northern Ireland (see last week’s HONIP paragraph 4), on 28 January to assess the current security situation and review it with the security forces and the Northern Ireland Government. 
DISTURBANCES 3. 
The Protestant Shankill area of Belfast was the scene of 
disturbances over the weekend. On 22 January Protestants reacted to Catholic celebrations in Hooker Street over the acquittal of three local men (see paragraph 16) by throwing stones and building a barricade of cars across the Crumlin Road.

4. On 23 January Protestant supporters of the Linfield football 
club, returning from a match in which their team had lost, clashed with the RUC, who had been trying to keep them on the move while passing the Roman Catholic Unity Flats area. The Army had to be called in and by midnight a crowd of about 150 had moved into the heart of the Shankill and built a barricade. The situation was quietened only four hours later. In all, the Army used 106 rubber baton rounds and suffered 11 minor casualties. Fourteen arrests were made. 
5. By 7 p.m. on 24 January a Protestant crowd of 350 gathered in 
the Shankill, close to the Catholic Falls area and had to be dispersed by the Army. They proceeded to stone the Tennant Street RUC station. Twenty-eight arrests were made during the evening and 20 baton rounds fired. 
6. Since the weekend there have been no serious disturbances in 
either Belfast or Londonderry. EXPLOSIONS 7. 
There have been a number of small explosions in various parts of 
Belfast but none has caused particularly serious damage. The use of incendiary devices continues. Six were discovered and successfully disarmed on 22 January and a further 2 on 26 January. Another was thought to have caused a small fire on 22 January. It is not known if these incidents are related or, if they are, who might be responsible for them. About 50 lbs. of explosives caused severe damage to Ministry of Health and Social Services offices in Enniskillen on 24 January. On 25 January 2 Republic of Ireland customs buildings situated at Lifford near Strabone were damaged, one extensively, by explosions. 
SPEECHES ON THE DISTURBANCES 8. 
On 22 January Mr. R. Bradford was reported as having said that 
the Ulster problem was simply that a substantial section of the community at best would only reluctantly acquiesce in British citizenship as a second choice and at worst hated it with a bitter hatred and would reject it with violence. That was why the British Army was attacked in Ballymurphy and the Ardoyne and "that is why this particular problem is a Catholic problem and why its solution is largely in the hands of the Catholic community". 
9. 
extremists for the recent disturbances. Opposition elements, including Mr. P. Devlin, and the Alliance Party, were able to make much of these speeches as a result of the trouble in the Protestant Shankill over the weekend. But the Northern Ireland Prime Minister issued a statement (reproduced in the Annex) condemning those responsible for the rioting and naming them as enemies of Northern Ireland. On 26 January Mr. Bradford appealed to Protestants not to play into the hands of the IRA. 
Mr. B. Faulkner, speaking the next night, blamed Republican

REPORT ON NORTHERN IRELAND, WEEK-END 22-24 JANUARY 1971 Most of the trouble over the week-end occurred in the 
Protestant Shankhill area of Belfast although there were a number of minor incidents in Londonderry and Creggan and six explosive devices were discovered and disarmed before ignition in various parts of Belfast. 
In the Shankhill, trouble started on Saturday afternoon 
on dispersal of the crowd from the Linfield football ground where the local team had been beaten by a mainly Roman Catholic team. Trouble went on until the early hours of Sunday morning. Barricades were erected, and bottles and stones thrown. The focus of hostility was the Army and the RUC. The Army used rubber baton rounds in attempting to contain the disturbances and suffered 11 minor casualties. 
Early on the Sunday evening crowds again gathered and 
there was an attack on an RUC station. A number of arrests were made and by 1 a.m. on Monday morning the area was quiet. 
It was noticeable that during the disturbances no petrol 
bombs were thrown and there was no evidence of firearms. The trouble may well have been provoked by a combination 
of: 
a. the acquittal on Friday of three Roman Catholic defendants in a murder trial; 
b. the Linfield football result; 
c. the Catholic rioting in the Ballymurphy area during the week beginning 10th January. 
There is no evidence of the affair having been managed by extreme Protestants-from outside the area.

DRAFT STATEMENT 
Ministers of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland government met in London this afternoon to review the current situation in Northern Ireland. 
They noted that responsible leaders of opinion in Northern Ireland had condemned in forthright terms the recent disorder in part of Belfast which can only injure the prospects of everyone who lives in Northern Ireland. These disorders are the work of a small number of extremists. They are being organised for political motives and the two governments wish to make it clear once again that they will not yield to force 
The army and the police in Northern Ireland will continue to work together in the closest co-operation. Their task, which are determined to fulfil, is not simply to contain riotous behaviour, but to seek out and subject to the rule of law those who take part in it and particularly those who foment and lead it. The S of S for Defence and the M of S, Home Office, will make an early visit to the security forces in Northern Ireland engaged on this task to assess the current situation and review it with them and the.Northern IrelandGovernment. 
The two governments are confident that the great majority of the people of Northern Ireland understand and will support their determination to take all necessary steps to eliminate violence Only thus can the Northern Ireland Government press ahead with its programme of modernisation and further development.

8 December, 1970 
I think that on my return from leave I should send you an "atmosphere piece" in an attempt to describe how things have developed since early November. 
I do 
so because on coming back to Belfast I found a very different mood from that which obtained in, for instance, early October. 
2. situation, only really marred by bomb explosions. 
The background is, of course, a great improvement in the law and order The great majority of these 
are the work of the I.R.A., though the police ascribe two recent small bangs to the Protestant extremists who had been inactive for some months. 
But most of these have been pretty trifling affairs, without loss of life. But most 
importantly there has been quiet on the streets and even the NICRA march in Enniskillen did not lead to public disturbances. 
3. This is traditionally a quiet period of the year. The reasons for this calm are 
complex, and one can only guess at the relative importance of the various factors. Among these factors I. would particularly mention the following. 
There have been no important anniversaries or customary marches to inflame tempers. The Government 
is beginning to reap the rewards of its reformist policies and of its levelheadedness. 
In particular the Prime Minister’s assurances about one man, one vote 
and the possibility of proportional representation in bye-elections has earned the administration considerable credit with the minority, as did Brian Faulkner’s skilful handling of the Central Housing Authority Bill. Within the party, the fact that the moderates have begun to fight back and gain successes over the extremists has strengthened the Prime Minister’s hand and increased his confidence. He is in d buoyant and almost aggressive mood and actively seeks show-downs with the Right-wing. 
He was much disappointed that he was denied the opportunity of 
a confrontation when Paisley did not appear to speak to the motion of censure sponsored by Beattie, McQuade and himself over representations to H.M. Government in connexion with ’espionage’. 
He had intended to invite Paisley to cross the 
floor of the House so that he would be in a position to make his criticisms of the Government face-to-face rather than ’over the shoulder’. 
The net result of all 
this is that James Chichester-Clark is earning the respect, and almost the confidence of many of the leaders of the minority, while he is very much more the master in his own house in the Unionist Party. 
One of the most significant and 
welcome developments of the past few weeks is therefore the increasing isolation of the extremists on both wings. 
4. other ways. 
The self-confidence of the Administration is beginning to show itself in We can expect them to become increasingly less biddable towards 
Westminster over minor issues and more anxious to do things their own way. it is by no means an unhealthy development. 
But Secondly, there is a growing 
disposition to establish a direct dialogue with the Opposition and other leaders the minority. 
For example, next week Brian Faulkner will be dining privately 
with me to meet Cardinal Conway for the very first time, and the Prime Minister also proposes to meet him, probably at Hillsborough. 
Philip Woodfield, Esq., C.B.E., Home Office.

5. On the strictly security side, the withdrawal of all but three battalions 
from Belfast to the country-side has contributed to a greater appearance of normality in the city, while the Army’s growing success in uncovering arms caches is a source of general satisfaction to the law-abiding; and as the Army edges itself back towards the barracks, the morale of the R.U.C. continues to improve. They have a very long way to go before they earn the full confidence of the minority, but the process has begun. 
The major moan of the minority at It will be of immense benefit to the R.U.C.

present is the alleged inequality between sentences imposed on Catholics and on Protestants, and for this the way in which the R.U.C. prepare and present charges is bla-ed. 
Paisley says the same thing in reverse. 
is a tender subject and the sooner the R.U.C. are insulated from the dispute the better.

that ’Lynch has pulled the rug from under their feet’. was obviously to be centred on the Special Powers Act. 
arisen. 
Their next major campaign Hitherto, the Prime 
Minister, in public at least, has not put a foot wrong in the matter. He re-itera 
that if he is advised by his security advisers that internment is necessary, he is prepared to intern. 
At the same time he indicates that this situation has not yet The police at present are firmly of the opinion that internment would be 
counter-productive, since they believe that however many I.R.A. men were picked up, others would come forward in their places. 
In my own view (and Father Murphy has 
volunteered a like opinion) the real extremists would welcome the introduction of internment. 
It would reverse the process of their isolation from the general 
Catholic population and the insurrectionary atmosphere of last summer would be recreated. 
In this over-long letter, I have painted an optimistic picture, but the circumstances as they exist at this moment warrant mild optimism. 
7. I need however hardly add that the situation is still fragile. An important kidnapping, the 
murder by the I.R.A. of two or three soldiers, or an explosion which caused a large number of casualties, would set the clock back a long way. 
One single act of 
political folly (and this seems unlikely under Major Chichester-Clark’s eminently level-headed leadership) could similarly cause a major set-back. 
so many people in Northern Ireland (and indeed in Eire) with hot-blood and a vested interest in violence, we cannot be too complacent or over-confident. 
But while there are

The IRA threat is nebulous and widespread; it may, for 
instance, include the use of hired criminals to obtain items on the IRAs behalf or the bribing of Servicemen and civilian employees to the same end. It is, therefore, difficult to guarantee effective counter action.

No doubt he hopes that while such improvements may pave the way for a united Ireland at some distant future date, they will in the meantime provide him with some useful arguments to deploy against his own extremists who seek earlier and inevitably bloodier solutions. Incidentally, we have always assumed that although the Irish, in deciding to apply for membership of the E.E.C. did so because their economy is tied to ours, they helped justify their decision to themselves by arguing an ultimate union with the North would thereby be facilitated.

Ref. A09466 PRIME MINISTER 
Northern Ireland The discussion this afternoon might most conveniently be organised 
under three main heads:A. 
1. Politically - 
How long can we hope that the present situation will last? i.e. How long is Major Chichester-Clark likely to be 
able to resist the rising pressure from both the IRA and the extreme Unionists ? The meeting of the Unionist Council to consider a vote of no confidence in Major Chichester-Clark’s Government, having been postponed because of the postal strike, now seems likely to take place at the end of this month. If it goes badly from our point of view, we may then be faced with a decision whether we are prepared to allow Craig and his associates to assume power. What should we do in those circumstances? 2. 
Militarily - i.e. Even if the present political situation persists 
indefinitely, can we safely assume that the Army will be physically able to contain the IRA/Unionist intimidation? Or will further reinforcements be required? And if so, shall we be able to supply them? (This assumes that the Army will continue to carry the brunt of dealing with the situation and that there will be no question of re-arming the RUC or reviving any body like the ’B’ Specials). 
B. 1. If there is a political collapse within the next few weeks, are we prepared to deal with it? Politically - i.e. Are our contingency plans for the introduction of 
direct rule in a state in which they could, if necessary, be implemented at very short notice? This means a Bill, various Orders under the Bill, the provision of personnel for key appointments, etc., etc. 
a decision on the position of the Governor - i.e. would he be our chosen 
instrument in a crisis; or should we wish to appoint a Minister of the United Kingdom Government to run the Province from Stormont? 2. 
Militarily It also means - i.e. Are the Chiefs of Staff (who have recently reviewed 
their own contingency plans) satisfied that in the "worst case" the Army could be sufficiently reinforced to cope? (Linked with this is the question of our intelligence arrangements in a "worst case", on which the JIC are conducting a fresh enquiry and I am trying to arrange for Sir Dick White, who returns from the Far East today, to visit Ulster in the very near future).

and regional development. Certain of the examples quoted would fit under this heading. 7. 
It may be said that the timing is not right, given the 
recent violence. The timing in Ireland will never be right if we only react to what the extremists do. Subject to the Home Secretary’s views, I think therefore there would be advantage if the general principles set out above could be discussed with Major Chichester-Clark when the Home Secretary visits Northern Ireland this week, and his concurrence sought for some move forward. 8.

THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WOULD REGARD MAJOR CHICHESTER-CLARK’S RESIGNATION AND THE REPLACEMENT OF HIS GOVERNMENT BY EXTREMIST UNIONISTS AS A MAJOR DISASTER BOTH FOR THE NORTH AND FOR THEIR OWN POLICIES. THEY WOULD REGARD DIRECT RULE FROM WESTMINSTER AS ONLY A SLIGHTLY LESSER DISASTER BECAUSE IT WOULD DEROGATE FROM THEIR POLICY OF SOLVING PARTITION THROUGH IRISH TALKING TO IRISH AND BECAUSE IT CLEARLY MIGHT LEAD TO COMMUNAL STRIFE. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU THINK THERE IS ANY ACTION I CAN TAKE WITH THEM WHICH WOULD HELP OUT CHICHESTER-CLARK. FOR INSTANCE WOULD IT HELP HIS POSITION IF THE TAOISEACH WERE TO ISSUE A MORE EXPLICIT STATEMENT OF CONDEMNATION OF THE IRA VIOLENCE, OR IF THE IRISH WERE TO TAKE MEASURES AGAINST THE IRA IN THE SOUTH? THERE CAN OF COURSE BE NO GUARANTEE THAT HE WOULD DO EITHER.

CONFIDENTIAL TO PRIORITY DUBLIN TELNO. 42 OF 26/2 AND TO UKREP BELFAST 1. DR HILLERY CALLED ON ME ON 25 FEBRUARY. HIS MAIN POINTS OF CONCERN WERE: A. THE POSSIBILITY THAT EXTREME UNIONISM WAS REGAINING INFLUENCE, AND THAT THE CHEQUERS MEETING PRESAGED A SLOWING OF MOMENTUM IN THE REFORM PROGRAMME. I SAID HE COULD DISMISS THAT THOUGHT FROM HIS MIND: ALL DISCUSSION HAD BEEN ABOUT GOING FORWARDS, NOT BACKWARDS. B. THE NEED TO CONSULT THE MINORITY AND TO GIVE THEM A VOICE IN THE ADMINISTRATION, AT LEAST AT LOWER LEVELS. THE USUAL FORMS OF DEMOCRACY COULD NOT MEET THE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF NORTHERN IRELAND. PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WAS ONE POSSIBILITY (HE EMPHASISED THAT HE WAS SPEAKING PERSONALLY AND QUOTE THINKING ALOUD UNQUOTE). C. THE NEED FOR SOME PRACTICAL RESPONSE TO MR LYNCH’S ’OLIVE BRANCH’ SPEECHES ON NORTH SOUTH COOPERATION. 2. I SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS DESIRABLE TO CRACK DOWN HARDER ON THE IRA, AND THAT, E.G., TRAINING CAMPS COULD BE HARASSED BY POLICE RAIDS. THE PROGRESS OF REFORMS IN NORTHERN IRELAND HAD ENDED ANY EXCUSE FOR VIOLENCE. DR HILLERY AGREED THAT HARSH MEASURES AGAINST THE IRA IN NORTHERN IRELAND SHOULD BE POLITICALLY POSSIBLE IF ACCOMPANIED BY REASSURANCES TO THE MINORITY THAT THIS DID NOT MEAN A RETURN TO EXTREME UNIONISM. HE WAS LESS CERTAIN ABOUT ACTION IN THE REPUBLIC, THOUGH HE DID NOT EXCLUDE IT. 3. DR HILLERY MENTIONED BRIEFLY THE RIFLE CLUBS TO ILLUSTRATE HIS ARGUMENTS ABOUT REASSURING THE MINORITY AND CONTRASTED ARMS SEARCHES FOR THE MINORITY WITH THE NUMBER OF LEGAL WEAPONS HELD BY THE MAJORITY. HE SHOWED CONCERN LEST BURROUGHS MIGHT NOT BE REPLACED (I REASSURED HIM ON THIS): SPOKE OF THE PROBLEMS OF BRITISH TROOPS ACCIDENTALLY CROSSING THE BORDER: AND WONDERED HOW TO ERADICATE CROSS BORDER SUSPICIONS BY, E.G., EXTENDING RTE COVERAGE IN NORTHERN IRELAND. HE CONCLUDED THAT THE IRISH GOVERNMENT AND MR LYNCH IN PARTICULAR WERE TRYING THE NOVEL POLICY, IN ANGLO-IRISH RELATIONS, OF MUTUAL TRUST: IF THIS FAILED IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS.

MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 
MO 19/3 PRIM MINISTER 
NORTHERN IRELAND I agree with the point you make in your minute 
of 15th February that we must vary our strategic dispositions according to the current assessment of the situation and objectives in Northern Ireland if we are to achieve our aims and use our available Security Forces to the best effect. 
You can be sure that we 
have this problem very much in mind both in the Ministry of Defence and in Headquarters Northern Ireland. 
2. The problem is essentially one of deciding what 
proportions of our total available effort should be directed at any one time towards deterring and if necessary stamping out any riots or disturbances in the cities; towards isolating, seeking out and bringing to trial the extremist ringleaders, and capturing their arsenals; and towards protective and deterrent operations in the rural areas and along the border. careful riot to over-react to any one threat. 
We have to be What the 
Security Forces in Northern Ireland therefore try to do is retain enough flexibility in their operations to deal with a variety of threats, as best they can, within the available force levels. 
3. It is true that at present the IRA are able 
frequently to take the initiative; but this stems not nearly so much from their use of the border for two-way traffic as from the scope they have for operating,within Northern Ireland, from urban bases in the Catholic areas, made relatively secure by intimidation and even murder. This is not to say that the existence of a sanctuary in EIRE with an unmarked land border 300 miles long enabing reinforcement or withdrawal by stealth at minimum risk - 
is not a considerable advantage to them. 
But the Security Forces would not be able to maintain close and continuous surveillance of the entire border

except by withdrawing to a large extent from the urban areas where I believe the greater part of the danger lurks - and, even then probably not unless their numbers were increased substantially (which could only be done at the expense of BAOR, 
- and this, as you know, would 
involve political as well as military penalties). 4. 
border is undefended. 5. 
However, I would not like you to think that the The main task of the armoured 
cars based in OMAGH is to patrol it; and this is an important part of the Ulster Defence Regiment’s raison d’etre as well. 
As an example of the flexibility of our operations 
which I have mentioned, you should know that this week we are carrying out two large and simultaneous search and sweep operations in the rural areas, using four infantry battalions, two armoured car squadrons, UDR detachments and Wessex helicopters. 
During the hours 
of darkness each night anything up to 20 ambushes will be mounted on the border, especially at Customs Posts with the aim of catching potential saboteurs. 
Meanwhile 
routine patrolling continues in strength in the cities. We propose to repeat this pattern of operations in the future. 
6. But what we need most of all in Northern Ireland is 
continuous and accurate intelligence and this particularly applies to effective counter-action against the extremists. With good intelligence we can forestall the enemy’s plans, arrest their ringleaders locate their arms dumps and hiding places and generally thwart their intentions. Without good intelligence we can do none of these things and we largely waste our resources. 
We are making every 
effort to improve the organisation and effectiveness of our intelligence network, and I believe that it is principally by an improvement in this respect that the initiative will be transferred to the Security Forces. 
7. I am sending copies of this minute to the Home Secretary and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.

DIFFICULTIES OF DEALING WITH THE IRA WITHOUT ALIENATING THE ROMAN CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IN WHOSE AREAS THEY OPERATE WERE RECOGNISED BY ALL PRESENT, AS WAS THE IRA AIM OF PROVOKING A ROMAN CATHOLIC/PROTESTANT CONFRONTATION.

4. Fuller account follows by bag. You 
if you may/wish inform the Irish authorities that 
the discussion ranged widely but no dramatic solutions were proposed or adopted. You may mention the points in paragraph 1 above and the fact that economic problems were discussed. The remainder is for your own information only, including a possibility of a conference. Our continuing concern with IRA extremism and our wish that the Irish should devise effective means for curbing the IRA on their side of the Border should be the underlying theme if you speak.

Prime Minister’s Personal Minute 
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE Northern Ireland 
If the view is taken that we now have to deal 
not so much with inter-community dissension and mob rioting as with a shooting confrontation between the British Army and the IRA, I suggest that we have to review the strategy for the deployment of British troops in Northern Ireland. 2. 
At present we have to fight the IRA largely on ground and at times of their choosing. 
Presumably the 
strategic objective should be to transfer the confrontation to ground and times of our choosing. 
If we believed 
that there was a constant come-and-go of IRA terrorists between the North and the South, there might be something to be said for transferring some of the Army’s effort from the cities to the border. 3.

been in the past: the gossip in Belfast was that they were now dependent on intimidation and bribery to get people out. 
Their objective was to try to provoke the 
Protestants into a major eruption. The Defence Secretary said that the security forces 
were in a difficult situation: they had to be careful not to press too hard so as to avoid provoking the Catholics; on the other hand, they had to be careful not to play too soft for fear of provoking the Protestants. One of their difficulties was that of identifying IRA terrorists operating in Belfast. 
It would help if the 
Special Branch were stronger, so that it could identify the IRA terrorists and bring about their elimination from the scene. Major Chichester-Clark agreed that the Special 
Branch in Northern Ireland was not as good as it should be, and was reluctant to let the security forces use the information available to it, from a desire to protect its sources. 
The Home Secretary said that there were 
already some members of the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police in Northern Ireland, and the Commissioner was ready to give further help. Major Chichester-Clark said that he would welcome

it was for the Northern Ireland Government to decide whether to introduce internment, but that they would not do so without consulting the British Government. He agreed that the Home Secretary might include a sentence to this effect in his speech to the House of Commons on 15 February. 
There was a sound practical 
reason for this consultation: it would not be possible for the Northern Ireland Government to hold internees without the help of the British Government. at Belfast was full. 
The gaol It would perhaps be possible to 
accommodate 80 to 120 internees at Armagh, but additional security preparations would have to be made, and it would not be possible to conceal the fact that they were being made. 
One possibility would be to use a ship, 
for instance HMS MAIDSTONE; but this was not attractive as a long term solution. 
Another possibility might be 
to set up an internment camp on Rathlin Island, but the Army would need six to eight weeks to prepare such a camp and the preparations could not be kept secret. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom said that, 
if it was judged that the problem was now one of dealing with a hard core of IRA terrorism, the time had perhaps come to reconsider the strategy for the security forces. At present the security forces had to fight the IRA on

NORTHERN IRELAND A Political Appreciation Her Majesty’s Government attaches great importance to the 
continuation of Major Chichester-Clarks’s Government, not only because of the likely complexion of any successor, but because any change will arouse the fears of the minority that the reform programme to which Major Chichester-Clark 
is committed will be put into reverse. After the week of increased violence, which began on 3 February in 
Belfast, Major Chichester-Clark’s Government looks slightly more secure than it did, say, three weeks ago, when, on 18 January, the Northern Ireland Prime Minister made a hasty trip to London to see the Home and Defence Secretaries to ask for firm action by the security forces against those responsible for disorders that had just occurred in Belfast. 
It was at that time (the middle 
of January) that the IRA was more openly attempting to create and aggravate disorder, and Major Chichester-Clark faced strong pressure from his supporters, as well as him Right Wing opponents, for the security forces to take tough action.

9 February 1971 SUMMARY OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY 
RE NORTHERN IRELAND FROM 1 to 8 FEBRUARY 1971 
1. The past week has been interesting if only to observe the 
curiously unreal activities of the various Irish extremist groups in London. With the ever worsening situation in Northern Ireland it would have seemed logical for them to react spontaneously in sympathy. They did not however, but steadfastly continued with their demonstrations, meetings, etc against the trial of Bowes EGAN and Frank ROCHE which had been planned for some weeks. Their activities listed below were all jointly organised by the Irish Solidarity Campaign, NICRA and Clann na h’Eireann:- 
a. On Friday 5 February they held a public meeting at Conway Hall, WC1. This was attended by some 50 persons and addressed by Eamonn McCANN, Gery LAWLESS, Padraig YEATES (Birmingham) and Bowes EGAN himself. Halfway through his speech, EGAN who appear recently to be finding solace in the bottom of a glass, became unwell and left the meeting. He was later heard to criticise the "ramblings" of LAWLESS and to express his disgust at the meeting.

MR FAULKNER’S STATEMENT ON TAKING OFFICE Tuesday 23 March 
throughout the entire community. Without that, all else would be futile. Obviously the kernel of our immediate problems is the law and order situation. 
My most important single aim is to restore confidence I am convinced that what we need on this front are not new 
principles but practical results on the ground in the elimination not only of terrorism and sabotage but of riots and disorders. The basic principle must clearly be that the rule of law shall operate in all parts of Northern Ireland, so that the security which goes with the rule of law can be enjoyed by all our citizens. 
It is the responsibility of the Army and the police to put 
that principle into effect. My Administration will give them every support. I will not expect harsh measures or repressive measures. No law-abiding citizen will have anything whatsoever to fear from my Administration. 
I will be looking for efficient measures. When the governments 
at Westminster aid Stormont take decisions on these matters we will certainly insist not only on effective action by the security forces but, and this is equally important, swift and decisive reaction to any trouble which might occur. 
I shall be looking urgently at ways and means of improving the 
present security arrangements, particularly the coordination of Army and police efforts. As to the police, I will certainly not allow the R.U.C. to be used as a political shuttlecock. 
The men have had to endure far too much over the past two years 
or so, with perhaps not enough thanks from the community. I am convince. that their normal role as a civilian police force is the right one, while at the same time it is obvious that whenever they are engaged on dangerous work they must be given the necessary protection. 
As for the part played by the Army, anti-government 
propagandist tend to imply that what the Government or the Unionistminded population are calling for are punitive jackboot tactics. Nothing could be farther from the truth. What I believe the entire law-abiding population of Northern Ireland is looking to the Government to ensure, and what I shall be aiming at, is that lawbreakers and criminals be brought to book and dealt with in the due process of the law receiving punishment appropriate to their cries.

Minister could have the time to carry out the executive responsibilities which would fall to him in Belfast and at the same time to play a full part and be fully in the picture in the development of thinking in London. The situation would be likely to require both a senior Minister in Belfast and a senior Minister in London - 
the need for both could be simultaneous. 
(ii) There would be a need, and strong pressure here and in Ireland (North and South), for extensive consultations on the constitutional future. There is therefore something to be said for keeping the situation in London flexible and not creating the impression at the start that any one solution, e.g. the Scottish or Welsh pattern, is the one HMG has decided on - or even the one HMG most favours. 
(iii) The greater part of our reinforced administrative machine would have to be located in London and should be answerable to a senior Minister here. It would have to be so located, partly because the processing of Northern Ireland legislation following the abolition of Stormont would be effected by Orders in Council laid before the Westminster Parliament and partly because direct rule would require the full co-operation of the Northern Ireland civil service. Although most of their senior staff could be expected to welcome a Westminster take-over if the alternative were rule by extremists, they would be sensitive to a substantial number of Whitehall civil servants being put over or alongside them visibly in Belfast, though they would recognise with greater or

We too have taken difficult decisions to 
the same end, and will continue to do so whenever necessary. 
In my statement on Monday I reaffirmed 
that the United Kingdom Government would give the strongest possible support to the Army in rooting out terrorism and maintaining law and order. 
I 
added that the Army will pursue this policy with the utmost vigour. 
I hope you will agree that there 
are no grounds for questioning our determination in this matter. 
As you know, I am always willing to discuss these 
problems at any time with you. Yours sincerely, Edward Heath

the internees, and the risk of political criticism if it proved possible to apprehend only a few of those concerned and they were in turn replaced "from south of the border. The Prime Minister toll Mr. Wilson that the Government 
had in any case proposed to reinforce the troops for the Easter arches. Following Major Chichester-Clark’s visit, these reinforcements had been brought forward, and two battalions and a squadron were now in the process of moving to Northern Ireland. They would be available to deal with any disturbances which might follow Major Chichester-Clark’s resignation: r. Paisley had said that "every loyal Ulsterman would rise" if Mr. Faulkner was elected Prime Minister. Major Chichester-Clark had also suggested more 
intensive cordoning and more immediate reaction to terrorist incidents. To both of these the British Government had agreed. He had also suggested that units of the Army should be stationed permanently in the Catholic areas. The military advice had been very strongly against this proposal: it would tie troops down, would expose them to dangers to which they might have difficulty in reacting , and could affront the Catholics. On this point, the Government had given Major Chi chester-Clark no decision on 16 March; they had instructed the G.O.C. to form a military judgement and had told Major Chichester-

to authorise to adoption of military measures such as the imposition of a curfew, merely as a punishment, or to try to precipitate a confrontation with the I.R.A. They must be adopted, if at all, because the situation required them. The Prime Minister confirmed, in answer to Mr. Wilson’s

preached moderation and was strongly against any attempt to provoke violence in order to repress it; but the Army must change its priorities and take a firmer line. The Attorney General suggested that the Army’s basic attitude must change from containment to the suppression of crime; in non-riot situations there must be more searches and a permanent presence in trouble areas; when riots occurred there must be a swift response and more effective action against offenders. This would require better liaison between police and military. The Minister of Community Relations said that people were being intimidated and the police could not give them protection. If the Northern Ireland Government could not offer its citizens protection, whether from Catholic or Protestant extremists, it was failing in its duty; yet the solution was not in its own hands. He agreed that the problem was a long-term one; but if the Government was to hold its position it must offer some immediate solution. 
5. Lord Carrington said that the differences between the two sides 
seemed to be more a matter of emphasis than of principle. There had been no major suggestions for new initiatives. The policy of the Army was not one of containment: they were determined to take action against the IRA; but for this it was essential to build-up intelligence, which was necessarily a slow process. However, he accepted the need for an intensification of military activity, primarily to restore public confidence. The suggestions which had been made would be carefully considered, including the idea put to him before the meeting of a briefing for newspaper editors and other news media in London on what the Army was doing. In reply to the Prime Minister who said that while he was generally content with the GOC’s directive the policy did not seem to have permeated to lower levels in the Army, Lord Carrington commented that there might have been occasional lapses, but the GOC would now ensure that the policy was vigorously pursued. 
6. General Sir Geoffrey Baker said that there would be an 
intensification of activity within the existing policy: this had already started and would be increased when more troops arrived at the weekend. Incidents would be promptly followed-up and the suggestions for the redeployment of the UDR and the establishment of Army/Police information points would be looked into. Part of the problem was one of education to meet ill-informed criticism. Lt General Tuzo confirmed that he would increase activities such as patrolling, but reiterated that in present circumstances he did not consider that the establishmer of static posts in trouble areas would be a sensible use of military manpower. 
7. Lord Carrington concluded by emphasising that there would be no 
change in the general policy of moderation. He hoped that it was clearly understood that whatever government was in office in Belfast extreme measures would not be tolerated in London. He repeated that the problem was essentially political and could only be solved by a long haul, not by calling for more troops every time an incident occurred. The situation was placing a severe strain on the Army and

CONFIDENTIAL TO PRIORITY F C 0 TELEGRAM NUMBER 223 OF 1 JULY, INFO UKREP BELFAST. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE IRISH IN LONDON 
1. I ASKED EAMON GALLAGHER TODAY WHAT POINTS WERE LIKELY TO BE RAISED BY IRISH OFFICIALS IN LONDON NEXT WEEK. GALLAGHER SAID THAT TWO OF THE POINTS LIKELY TO BE RAISED WERE POLICY FOR-THE PARADE SEASON, AND SOME POINTS ON WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED ’’THE PARTICIPATION DEBATE’’ AT STORMONT. 2. AS TO PARADES, HE SAID THAT BY FAR THE MOST DANGEROUS WOULD BE THE APPRENTICE PARADE AT LONDONDERRY ON 12 AUGUST. THE DANGER LAY IN THE ELEMENT OF PROVOCATION WHICH THE PARADE INVOLVED, AND THIS WOULD LEAD TO VIOLENCE AFTER THE PARADE HAD DISPERSED. IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SANITISE THE PARADE ITSELF BY APPROPRIATE SECURITY MEASURES, BUT A PROVOCATIVE ELEMENT WAS THE NATURE OF THE PARADE, AND THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF THE APPRENTICE BOYS CAME FROM OTHER AREAS, SOME EVEN FROM LIVERPOOL AND GLASGOW. IF THE PARADE WERE HELD, THE VIOLENCE ’WHICH FOLLOWED WOULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE RELATIONS, WHICH AT PRESENT WERE EXEMPLARY, BETWEEN THE RUC AND THE LOCAL POPULATION. HE DID NOT THINK THAT THE DIFFICULTY COULD BE MET BE RE-ROUTINE,EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF FOLLOWING THE APPARENTLY INNOCUOUS ’’ WATERSIDE ROUTE’’. THE DANGER AT LONDONDERRY WAS FUNDEMENTAL. EXTREMIST ELEMENTS FROM BELFAST COULD BE EXPECTED TO TAKE PART IN THE VIOLENCE. THERE WAS NO REAL ALTERNATIVE TO BANNING THE PARADE. 3. AS TO THE EVENTS ON 12 JULY, GALLAGHER HAD BEEN GIVING THOUGHT TO THE 19 PARADES WHICH WERE PLANNED. HIS PRESENT FEELING WAS THAT THE PARADE AT STRABANE NEEDED PARTICULARLY CLOSE WATCHING, AND ON A LOWER LEVEL THE PARADES AT ENNISKILLEN AND BALLYCASTLE HE DID NOT ARGUE THAT THESE PARADES SHOULD NECESSARILY BE BANNED BUT THAT THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS POSSIBLE FLASH POINTS. THE SAME MIGHT BE TRUE OF TWO OR THREE OTHER PARADES ON 12 JULY, TO WHICH HE WOULD GIVE FURTHER THOUGHT. 4. IN A RUDIMENTARY CLASSIFICATION, GALLAGHER SAID THAT STRABANE MIGHT BE A 3 STAR RISK, AND ENNISKILLEN AND BALLYCASTLE A 1 STAR’ RISK, BUT LONDONDERRY 0N 12 AUGUST WAS AT LEAST A 5 STAR RISK.

in position having failed to explode. On Tuesday night an Army patrol discovered three men working with explosives at the Killeen customs post. Two of the three, who were all dressed in combat jackets and berets, escaped but one man, with an address in Newry, was arrested. Following this incident the patrol discovered a suitcase containing 45 lbs. of explosives, lengths of fuse and detonators. Finds of a suitcase similarly equipped have been made in the same area on each of the following two days. 
ARMY EQUIPPED TO USE DYE 
11. It was announced on 18 June (before the large Orange parade in Belfast the following day) that the Army had been equipped with dye to use if necessary in water sprayed from water-cannon during riot situations. People could then be identified subsequently as having been in the area of the disturbance. Assurances were given that the 
dye is completely harmless. CENTRAL CITIZENS’ DEFENCE COMMITTEE STATEMENT 
12. The Central Citizens’ Defence Committee (CCDC) which claims to represent the residents of the Roman Catholic Falls Road district of Belfast, issued a statement on 17 June which condemned the latest round of explosions as "immoral and cowardly without regard for Christian or democratic principles", and called for an end to the terrorist campaign. The Falls Road district is treated as its preserve by the Goulding faction of the IRA, and the CCDC’s statement reflects Cathal Goulding’s own public attitude of condemning terrorist activities. 
SPEECHES BY MR PAISLEY AND MR CRAIG 
13. Mr Paisley and Mr Craig have continued their opposition to the present Northern Ireland Government both in Stormont (see paragraph 5) and outside. Speaking at a rally of his Protestant Unionist party in Burntollet, County Londonderry, Mr Paisley demanded a general election so that the people could decide on Mr Faulkner’s policies. He advised everyone who had a licensed gun to keep it so that they would be in a position to resist any "deal with Dublin". Mr Craig, speaking at the opening of a new Orange hall near Cookstown said that responsibility for law and order in Northern Ireland had passed to Westminster and peace and stability would not come unless the Northern Ireland Parliament had it returned. 
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE 
14. Seventy-one Roman Catholic priests have called for an enquiry into the administration of justice on the scale of those carried out in other fields by Lord Cameron, Lord Hunt and Lord Scarman. The internal enquiry set up by the professional legal associations, they said, was inadequate (see HONIP(71) 23 paragraph 16). Referring to their earlier protest about the administration of justice (see HONIP(71) 17 paragraph 7) the priests said that some improvements had been accompanied by other disquieting developments.

other offences. Furthermore, what we face is not an old-style IRA Campaign at all, but the now type of terrorism mounted by the urban guerilla, which is now a problem in many countries and is nowhere easy to put down. Just as the problem for the American Army in Vietnam, with all its massive fire-power, has been to cope with an enemy indistinguishable from the general population, so it is immensely difficult to cope with an enemy who can mount hit-and-run attacks in the streets of his own native city; or, if he comes from outside the state, with the aid and succour of elements of the local population. 
And yet the present type of violence, horrifying though it is, is symptomatic of a change in the situation which is not to the advantage of the IRA 
- given a steady and sensible response by the general 
population. The point I wish to make is that these military acts by the IRA have a political purpose 
- the widespread involvement 
in disorder of the civil population, leading to such a degree of instability that Northern Ireland’s position in the United Kingdom would be called into question. Massive and prolonged street rioting was just what the IRA wanted to see 
- particularly when tension could 
be created in Protestant and Roman Catholic areas alike. That very dangerous phase has to a great extent, though not entirely, been brought under control. There remains the problem of getting to the roots of terror. And here, I think, three things are necessary. RESPONSE TO THE THREAT: A THREE-PRONGED APPRAOCH First, there must be continuous, sustained, unrelenting pressure by the security forces. By widespread arms searches, by intensive and unpredictable random checks, by a policy of hot pursuit, by rapid and effective response to any attack, we can not only inflict casualties on the terrorists, limit their access to weapons and disrupt their movements and communications, we can also steadily undermine their morale. 
Secondly, we must see to it that the steadiness not only of the Government and the security forces, but of the whole country, is such that the terrorists realise their methods have no prospect of ultimate success. And that also demands equal steadiness at Westminster and in Great Britain. Any wavering, any appearance of weakness or weariness, any hint of compromise with terror, is a massive encouragement to the subversives in our midst. I will not fool the country with the delusion that there is some simple remedy

to bring this ugly business to a rapid and; but I say clearly that we must never give way to a despairing attitude in which our enemies would discern the glint of success. In that context, a particularly heavy responsibility falls upon the media of communications to observe very high standards of steadiness, balance and objectivity. 
Thirdly, by all our actions as a Government we must show every interest in this community that terrorism has nothing to offer them:that whether they want protection, opportunity, justice or self-respect we can guarantee these things. 
These three elements in our strategy must all be pursued with vigour and consistency. ROLE 0F THE RUC In any return to conditions of normality, the Royal Ulster Constabulary must play a role of special importance. It is suggested in some quarters that the only recent decision of significance taken in this field has been to disarm the police force. That is not so: for the long-term future of the force, and of Northern Ireland, incomparably the most important decision has been to build up the strength to almost 5,000 men. The public still does not appreciate the extent to which past difficulties were a question of inadequate numbers. then, in 1968, processions were banned for a period in Londonderry, the RUC - equipped as they were with the authority of the then Minister’s Order, and of course still carrying firearms - were quite unable in practice to enforce that prohibition, because of their lack of numbers and the absence of public co-operation and goodwill in observing the law. RUC ARMS 
The corner-stone of declared Government policy for the Police has been and is that the RUC should be a "civilianised and normally unarmed force". I find a great deal of misunderstanding of what this actually means. To say that the force will be "normally unarmed" is to state that this is how it will seek to operate in a state of normality. There is not a state of normality when policemen are liable to be attacked in their stations and even in their homes by brutal assassins seeking to kill or maim them. There is not a state of normality when, as they go about their ordinary police duties, they may encounter armed and violent men. 
It is merely giving aid to an enemy to be precise about how, where and when members of the police force will be armed: but I want to

of his own extremists and Mr Paisley for re-arming the Police, internment and the resurrection of the B Specials. He shows an understanding of the problems confronting the Army and a desire to work cooperatively with the Army Command. He has worked hard, and with considerable success, to reduce the number of marches to be held in the next three months. 
economic cooperation with the Irish Republic. 
He is firm in his wish to develop cross-border But all 
this is of small avail unless he can show that he is determined to bride the tribal gap; 
responsibility to secure the general good; 
that he recognizes a Prime Minister’s that he is not 
simply the leader (some would say the captive leader) of a Unionist Party permanently in power. 11. 
I suspect that Mr Faulkner could be more efficiently 
served by parts of his own Government machine and I have already indicated that some of his Ministers are not sufficiently house-trained. 
If this is so it is a reflection on Mr Faulkner himself. It begins to look as if he lacks that 
authority, combined with a hint of menace, which a leader needs. It suggests that he is not the tough man we hoped to see. 12. 
Whether or not Mr Faulkner is up to scratch we 
have to make the best we can of him, and I think he can be got to do a tolerable job if we handle him right. 
The 
heart of the matter is his assessment of the pressures which bear upon him, and his resolution in pursuing a policy appropriate to the problems of Northern Ireland and acceptable to the United Kingdom Government. 
He is a short-term 
thinker and if he assumes, as I think he does, that the problem of the minority is first and foremost a problem of

weeding out the violent elements, that is to say it is at present primarily a security problem, the main political pressure which he feels is the threat to his position from the extremists in his own party and from Mr Paisley. He is therefore tempted to see his policy in terms of countering this political threat, and in this lies the danger that he will fall down on reform. 
He may have calculate that the United 
Kingdom Government is anxious at all costs to keep him in office and will not prose him very strongly to get ahead with putting the reform legislation into practice. If that is his conclusion, and if it is not corrected, the joint Declaration of the 19th of August 1969 may become a dead letter. If that were to happen the consequences, not least for Mr Faulkner himself, do not need spelling out. 13. 
It in my view therefore that Mr Faulkner should be 
rained privately, but plainly, of the need to show early progress on a number of fronts. 
A list, which I do not 
claim to be complete, is as follows : a) 
a determined effort to establish contacts with 
leading members of the minority, inside and outside Parliament; b) 
a decision to consult representatives of the 
minority about appointments of Catholics to public bodies and a willingness to include "awkward customers" if these are favoured by the minority; 
(the 
question of publicity for this should be discussed privately with Opposition members in Parliament); c) a greater conviction in Ministerial speeches of the need to resolve social and political problems in a spirit of equality; (’one man one vote’ does not

11 June, 1971. 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 4 - 10 JUNE, 1971. 
Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL SITUATION 1. 
Although the increased number of attacks on the security 
forces in the week under review have caused little damage or injury (see paragraph 3 below) their incidence is sufficient to give opponents of the Northern Ireland Government opportunity to claim that its policies for dealing with terrorists are not working. On the other hand, reports that a full-time battalion of the UDR was under consideration may be assumed to have given these critics some confort. There is no sign of any loss of confidence by the Government itself. 
2. Mr Hume’s verbal attack on Mr Faulkner (paragraph 7 below) is 
symptomatic of the distrust that Opposition representatives have for the Government, and reflects their doubts about its sincerity in carrying out the spirit of the reform programme. But Mr. Faulkner’s decision to ban an Orange Order parade in Dungiven (paragraph 10) has won him some measure of support from the Opposition 
SECURITY SITUATION 3. 
The week has seen a continuance, after last week’s brief lull, 
of attacks of varying severity on the security forces. Four RUC stations were the subject of explosive attacks, including, again, that in the Springfield Road (see HONIP(71) 21, paragraph 7). In this incident the assailant’s attempts to throw the explosive into the courtyard of the station were frustrated by high wire netting and the warning shouts of a sentry on the roof. No serious injury resulted from this or the other attacks on RUC stations. Four Army patrols were the subject of separate attacks during the week, three by explosive devices and one with a starting pistol (for which a man has since been arrested). Again any damage or injury was not serious. A group of soldiers talking to girls outside their platoon station in the Divis area of Belfast on 8 June were fired on by four men with three machine guns. Two soldiers were wounded, but not seriously. It was not possible to return the fire. Other explosive attacks took place on transformers and private property. Arms and ammunition continued to be found in small quantities. A major arms find by the Thames

Valley Constabulary at Ascot has, on present evidence, no connection with Republican extremists in Northern Ireland or the Republic. 
INTERVIEW OF GOC, NORTHERN IRELAND 4. 
General Tuzo, the GOC, was interviewed on BBC television 
’24 Hours’ programme on 8 June. In explaining the British Army’s attitude to its task, he said: "I don’t think we can achieve a 
permanent solution by military means". The British Army, he continued, could achieve a gradual military ascendancy over the IRA that would allow politicians to work out a settlement. He outlined the problem of maintaining good relations with people in Roman Catholic areas while still dealing with the problem of the IRA. In ’hard-core areas’, he said, better results could be achieved by being ’stern’ than attempting to capture the allegiance of the people. 
FULL-TIME BATTALION OF THE ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT 5. 
After speculation in newspapers at the weekend the Ministry 
of Defence issued a statement that the possibility of raising a full-time battalion within the Ulster Defence Regiment was being considered, although no decision had been taken. Legislation, it was pointed out, would be required. In spite of assurances by both Westminster, that any such battalion would continue to be controlled by the Ministry of Defence; and by the Army, that if it were formed it would not be used for crowd control or riot duties, Opposition spokesmen in Northern Ireland attacked the proposal. Mr Fitt, MP said that Mr Faulkner was responding to right-wing pressure for the re-creation of the ’B’ Specials, and that the proposed force would never be created because of the extent of opposition to it. Other spokesmen accused Mr Faulkner of deliberately ’leaking’ the fact that the proposed force was being considered. Mr McQuade, MP (an ultra-Protestant expelled from the Unionist Parliamentary Party) welcomed the idea, however, and Mr Paisley said it was a step in the right direction. At Westminster, Mr Roy Hattersley, MP asked for an assurance that political reasons would not be used to justify the creation of the force. 
MR FAULKNER’S SPEECH TO THE FOREIGN PRESS ASSOCIATION, AND OPPOSITION REACTION 
6. Addressing the Association on 4 June Mr Faulkner, in a widely- 
reported speech, emphasised that the current disorders in Northern Ireland in no sense stemmed from a fight for civil rights, upon which Northern Ireland was ahead of the rest of the United Kingdom. Nor, he said, were the terrorists fighting for self-determination for the Northern Irish people. The latter had continuously expressed it as their will, through democratic elections, to remain part of the United Kingdom. Anyone could put forward Republican views if he remained within the law, but the terrorists were aiming to bypass the democratic process. Nor, he said, did

( 10. On 21 May Mr. Lynch had said, with reference to the incidents at and around Gallaher’s, that the minority remained victims of a system which excluded them from participation in society. Care, he said, should be exercised in dealing with their protest. It was not acceptable "that the British Army should be used to suppress their legitimate protests against intimidation or that the British Army should be drawn into situations involving the risk of excessive reaction in support of discriminatory practices". United Kingdom Government Ministers are due to answer Parliamentary Questions on what attitude they have taken towards Mr. Lynch’s statement. In fact, the Irish Government has been told that the UK Government regrets the statement which it feels can be exploited by extremists. In a later statement, related to the blowing-up of a public house in the Shankill Road (see paragraph 7), Mr. Lynch condemned forthrightly those who resorted to violence. Meanwhile Mr. Faulkner was reported to have said at a Conservative Party meeting in London that while Mr. Lynch was in a difficult position his criticism of the British Army was contrary to his former statesmanlike approach. 
11. On 25 May Mr. Faulkner, with the whole series of explosive and shooting incidents no doubt in mind, said in Stormont that "The Army is not prepared to take half measures with terrorists. At this moment any soldier seeing a person with a weapon or acting suspiciously may fire to warn or with effect depending on circumstances without waiting for orders". This was widely interpreted as giving the military wider discretion than before to open fire, and members of the SDLP threatened a boycott of Stormont if such instructions were confirmed by the Ministry of Defence. 
Mr. Faulkner has since said that his statement that 
troops could fire at persons acting suspiciously applied only to persons carrying firearms or explosives. This brings what he said into general line with the instructions that are issued to the troops; but leaves open the question of firing warning shots. In replying to Questions at Westminster, the Minister of State for Defence, Lord Balniel, said that he understood Mr. Faulkner had amplified what he had said and there was no disagreement over the instructions given to the troops which remained unchanged. Lord Balniel did, however, say that it was not the practice of the British Army to fire warning shots. 
12. Other reactions to the unsettled week have been predictable. Mr. McManus, M.P. was reported to have said that, while he condemned violence, the people who resorted to it were not lunatics and did so for a specific reason: he found it difficult to condemn them although he thought attacks on the British Army were futile. The Rev. Martyn Smith (see HONIP(71) 14 paragraph 2) told a meeting in Londonderry that more people were needed who were "no longer ashamed to be Protestant and are prepared to say that Lord Craigavon was right when he said ’A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people’" because that meant not "jack-booting over other people" but the uniting of Protestantism 
"against the domination and shackles of Romanism". Mr. Bleakley, Minister of Community Relations, condemning the explosive attacks, stressed that there should be "no reckless retaliation".

SECURITY FORCES "CLOSE-IN" 
The Prime Minister has told Belfast businessmen that the police and Army were "making it hotter" for terrorists, and were beginning to "close-in" on Northern Ireland’s wanted men: 
In the past four weeks alone the security forces have searched more than 150 occupied houses, almost 600 unoccupied houses and stopped and checked 85,000 vehicles. As a result of this activity one machine gun, 11 rifles, 28 revolvers, 10 shotguns, almost 4,000 rounds of ammunition, almost 300 lb of explosives, 300 detonators and miscellaneous explosive materials have been seized. This represents real progress and one particular development, namely, the dumping of arms shows that many terrorists or would-be terrorists have been unnerved. This in itself is a most important development, for I believe there will be no end to terrorism until the subversionists are forced to the realisation - as they were at the end of the 1956-62 campaign 
- that they could mke no headway

THE PRIME MINISTER welcomed the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland He said that Mr. Faulkner had made it clear on taking office that he intended to continue the policies of social reform which had commended themselves to the United Kingdom Government and the previous Northern Ireland Government. The United Kingdom Parliament attached importance to progress in this field, and it was a significant factor in our relations with the Irish Republic. He believed, however, that the most urgent problem for discussion was the restoration of public confidence by the maintenance of order and the suppression of IRA terrorism. 
MR. FAULKNER said that under his administration, there would be no going back on the social policies that had been agreed, and that his whole Government was united on this point. He wanted to bring the minority in Northern Ireland into discussions on public affairs at all levels, and not only the political level; and to involve them in the activities of public boards. He had marked the importance which he attached to community relations by appointing Mr. Bleakley, who had stood as a candidate for the Northern Ireland Labour Party, as Minister of Community Relations, and Mr. Bleakley had plans in hand for fostering good relations between the communities. He agreed that the most immediately pressing problem was internal security and that the maintenance of public order was the first step in the restoration of public confidence. 
INTERNAL SECURITY Patrolling and Other Measures 
THE PRIME MINISTER, who took the opportunity to welcome General Sir Michael Carver on his appointment as Chief of the General Staff, and Mr. Howard Smith, who was taking up his duties as the new United Kingdom representative in Northern Ireland, said that the object of the security forces must be to maintain law and order and to combat IRA terrorism without endangering the progress that had been made in relations between the communities by provocative acts against the minority. 
THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING said that the Army conducted cordoning operations when it was profitable to do so as a reaction to offensive action, or in pursuance of reliable information that terrorists or arms were to be found in a certain area. Road checks were carried out at uncertain intervals to achieve surprise, and he would arrange for intensified efforts to be made, particularly in the proximity of the Border. The Army had the capacity to establish curfews, when the necessary orders were made by the Minister of Home Affairs, but they were a measure which, in his view, should be used sparingly, as enforcement was difficult. Foot patrols were conducted by day in as many areas as could be covered with the resources that he had available, and he hoped that, as confidence grew, these patrols would come to be regarded by the

Firearms 
MR. FAULKNER said that he had called for the surrender of weapons and had declared an amnesty in respect of criminal prosecutions. He had also instructed the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) to arrange for all revolver licencees to be visited and asked to justify their need for a revolver. There was no evidence that arms held under licence had been used for improper purposes, and the matter was therefore one of some political delicacy. No new permits had been issued for rifle clubs for some time, and he would take an opportunity of making that fact publicly known. 
Processions 
MR. FAULKNER said that, although he wanted to reduce the number of processions and remove the possibility of dangerous confrontations, he was not proposing a general prohibition of processions. 
If, however, 
organisers of processions insisted on taking routes that would involve dangerous community confrontations, he would not hesitate to prohibit a particular procession or compulsorily to alter its route. 
Only a small 
number of the parades due to be held over Easter were likely to cause difficulty, and measures wore in hand to deal with them. 
THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING confirmed that he had sufficient resources to deal with any trouble that might arise. 
Internment 
MR. FAULKNER said that he would not agree to any proposal for the use of the internment powers in the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Acts, unless he was advised by the Army and the police that internment would bring IRA terrorism decisively to an end. The General Officer Commanding had indicated to him that he was against internment and the Chief Constable also, although he had reported that the Special Branch of the RUC were marginally in favour of it. - Although the use- of internment on both sides of the Border appeared to have been a significant factor in bringing IRA terrorism to an end in 1962, the IRA campaign then was of a different character to their present operation and he himself was not in favour of internment at this juncture. There would be advantage in bringing in a number of suspects for questioning, but that too would entail the use of special powers of detention which he was anxious to avoid. He agreed nevertheless that it would be prudent to have plans ready, should internment have to be resorted to. 
THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING said that HMS Maidstone Could be used only temporarily; a reconnaissance had been carried out, and it was recommended that a site at Long Kesh was the most suitable site for constructing a camp for internees.

Northern Ireland 
The Nature of the Problem This note sets out to analyse the nature of the 
problem facing the United Kingdom Government, the factors that affect the range of possible solutions. 
First, what 
is the problem of Northern Ireland? Different people would give different answers even to this preliminary question, but one may venture the proposition that the problem consists in finding a means whereby all the people of Northern Ireland can enjoy as full and free a life in the Province as they cod anywhere else. 
But this 
objective can never be fully achieved; any solution is bound to be second best. 
Innate divisions The division between the two communities is innate 
and must be expected to last for a very long time to come. It is often said that the religious difference is nominal and that Protestants and Roman Catholics are merely convenient labels by which to describe a difference in national loyalties. 
That is to some extent true, but the 
truly religious nature of the division is not to be overlooked. 
The difference is aggravated because the 
dominant sects lie at extremes of Christian doctrine: Catholicism and Calvinism and the formal practice of religion is very strong/ 
The relative isolation of 
Ireland keeps alive religious tensions that have died elsewhere. 
In Northern Ireland the communities are intermingled 
in a way which, generally speaking and subject to what is said below, admits of no further geographical partitioning. The Unionist Protestants build a fortress through fear of being engulfed in Catholic Ireland. 
The Roman Catholic 
nationalists regard themselves as subjects of an alien colonial rule and live in fear that the Protestants will destroy them. 
This innate difference in national loyalty 
transcends all other political forces; and its foundation is fear.

Displayed characteristics However the intensity with which these differences Standing virtually 
find expression varies considerably. 
outside both communities are organisations, notably the IRA, which seek to subvert not only the constitution of Northern Ireland but that of the Republic as well. 
These 
organisations receive shelter from parts of the Roman Catholic community partly through intimidation and partly because they appear to represent nationalist aspirations. The eradication of these elements is clearly the highest short term priority, but it will still leave extremists in both communities who would be ready to rise to arms against their neighbours in simple aggression or as a response to fear. 
Between these extremes lie the majority 
of the population; the innate divisions are always present, but their closeness to the surface depends on the pressure of events, by which the majority of the people are easily swayed. 
The aspirations of most of the members of both communties are no doubt for freedom, a job and a home. 
The 1920 Settlement The continuance of the constitutional settlement of The Act of 1920 was 
1920 is a historical accident. 
intended as a device for granting limited home rule to two parts of Ireland and not to Northern Ireland alone. 
The 
constitutional settlement with Northern Ireland should have followed rather than preceded the Treaty of 1921, and if the aim of the legislators at the time had been to create institutional arrangements for the North alone, the result might have been very different; Northern Ireland might have been treated in the same way as Scotland - or Ireland before 1920: a result that might well have appealed to Unionists at that time. 
But 50 years of 
limited home rule make the Unionists reluctant to part with it, the more so because it would inevitably dilute their power and weaken the walls of their fortress.

The 1974 Election The statutory life of the present Northern Ireland 
Parliament expires in February 1974. If present trends 
continue, a general election would give a sweeping victory to the extreme unionists. 
This would mean an end of any 
hope of a liberal administration; it would also add very considerably to the difficulty of reforming the present arrangements. 
We have therefore 2 years in which to 
operate (a consideration which may well be present in the minds of both communities); I have therefore tried to concentrate on the middle term rather than the very long term. 
The Range of Possible Solutions We may now consider the range of possible action, 
which can be divided into 3 headings: independence for Northern Ireland, an accommodation with the Republic and institutional reform. 
An Independent Northern Ireland Independence for Northern Ireland, with the removal 
of the Army, however attractive it might seem to the longsuffering British public, presents almost insuperable difficulty. 
First it would involve a breach of the 
pledge concerning incorporation in the United Kingdom, unless it arose from the request of the Northern Ireland Parliament 
would involve an abdication of responsibility for the people of both communities which could not be defended. 
An Accommodation with the Republic An accommodation with the Republic could take various 
forms: incorporation of Northern Ireland in the Republic and a united Ireland, or some form of federation or confederation or condominium. 
It would be possible to 
devise a scheme, but it is hard to see how any scheme in which the Irish Republic had a hand in the administration of Northern Ireland could possibly succeed within the next 
- a not impossible event in certain circumstances 
Secondly, it could well lead to civil war or war between the independent Province and the Republic. 
Thirdly, it

the band of the extremists and making it much more difficult to achieve the reconciliation towards which we are all supposed to be working. 
Because of the nature of the reply I think 
it would probably be convenient for the Home Office to take the lead and I should therefore be grateful if you could let me have a draft prepared in consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, by end of business on Monday 16 August.

Following is the draft of a statement to be televised b 
Mr. Faulkner and issued. Begins. 
1. If Northern Ireland is to survive and prosper, two things 
are essential. We must sustain a continuing programme of economic and social development, and we must find the means to create a more united society here 
- one in which all men of good will, hoever divergent their legitimate political views, 
may participate to the full. These things are, and will continue to be, the aims of our policy. 2. 
Neither will be possible in a climate of terrorism and 
violence. The outrages to which we have been subjected now threaten our economic life and create every day deeper divisions and antagonism within our community. These, indeed, are the clear objects of those who carry then out. 3. 
Every means has been tried to make terrorists amenable to 
the law. Nor have much methods been without success, because a substantial number of the most prominent leaders of the IRA are now serving ordinary prison sentences. But the terrorist campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthless viciousness. 4. 
I have therefore decided, after weighing all the relevant 
considerations, including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with HMG in the UK last Thursday, to exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as minister of Home Affairs. 
5. Accordingly, a number of men have been detained by the 
security forces at various places in Northern Ireland this morning. I will be making internment orders in respect of such of these men as constitute a serious and continuing that to public order and safety. This will be done only after a careful scrutiny of information furnished to me by the polic in respect of each such person, sufficient to convince me that the individual in question is a threat to present peace and maintenance of order. Any such person will then have the right

of access to an advisory committee, which will hear representations for release and make recommendations to me. 6. 
I have taken this serious step solely for the protection 
of life and security of property in Northern Ireland. At all times I have consistently emphasized that it was not a step towards which I would be moved by any political clamour. Equally, I cannot now allow the prospect of any misrepresentation to deflect me from my duty to act. 
7. This is not action taken against any responsible and las- 
abiding section of the community. Nor is it in any way punitive or indiscriminate. Its benefits should be felt not least in those areas where violent men have exercised a certain sway by threat and intimidation over decent and responsible men and women. 8. 
The main target of the present operation is the Irish 
Republican Army.which has been responsible for recent acts of terrorism, and whose victims have included Protestant and Roman Catholic alike. They are the present threat: but we will not hesitate to take strong action against any other individuals or organisations who may present such a threat in the future. 9. 
It is with understandable reluctance that one uses these 
exceptional powers, but the organisations concerned are those which have murdered in cold blood, created situations which have led to death or injury to people quite uninvolved in disorder, maimed numerous people including young children and put at risk the jobs and the whole future of ntire communities. I ask those who will quite sincerely consider the use of internment powers as evil to answer honestly this question:Is it more of an evil than to allow the perpetrators of these outrages to remain at liberty? I cannot guarantee that the action we have now taken will bring this campaign swiftly to an end. We may yet have much to endure as a community: but if we endure it with courage and steadiness, the utter defeat of terrorism is sure.

11. I am sorry that this decision will inevitably interfere 
with rights and traditions cherished by many people, but I mut ask all concerned to accept it as truly necessary in the vital interests of th e country. We are, quite simply, at war with the terrorist, and in a state of war many sacrifices have to be made, and made in a co-operative and understanding spirit. 12. The action we have now taken does not indicate any policy of repression. We are acting not to suppress freedom, but to allow the overwhelming mass of our people to enjoy freedom including freedom from fear of the gunman, of the nightly explosion, of fire-raising, of kangaroo courts and all the apparatus of terrorism. The rest of us cannot truly be free while people determined to commit such outrages are at large. 13. In particular, I want to say a wrd directly to my Catholic fellow-countrymen. 
I do not for one moment confuse your 
community with the IRA or I imagine that these acts of terror have been committed in your name or with your approval. I have always had great respect for the god-fearing people. Albeit with political views different from.my own - I have met in every part of Ulster. I respect the way in which your religious leaders, and many of your public representatives, have outspoken condemned violence as immoral.

My door is open to any of your leaders, political or religious, who want to discuss how we can now move forward.

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WAS ISSUED ABOUT 9 PM THIS EVENING ON BEHALF OF THE TAOISEACH. 
QUOTE. 
DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS EVERY EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT MERELY TO PREVENT THE DETERIORATION OF THE SITUATION IN THE NORTH BUT TO OBTAIN THE IMPLEMENTATION THERE OF SUCH POLICIES AS WOULD PROVIDE AND PROTECT THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE NON UNIONISTS IN THE POPULATION 
. WE HAVE 
REPEATEDLY EXHORTED THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES TO COMPLETE THIS TASK WITH THE UTMOST SPEED AND IN FULL MEASURE. WE HAVE ASKED THE NORTHERN MINORITY TO BE PATIENT AND TO ACCEPT THATIT WAS THE INTENTION OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO HONOUR THE DOWNING STREET DECLARATION OF 19TH AUGUST 1969. WE HAVE ALSO ASKED THEM TO REJECT THE USE OF VIOLENCE BECAUSE NOT ONLY WOULD VIOLENCE PRECLUDE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS BUT IT WOULD PERPETUATE THE DIVISIONS AMONG THE IRISH PEOPLE. 
WE HAVE ACTED WITH RESPONSIBILITY AND RESTRAINT THROUGHOUT ALL THE DIFFICULTIES OF THEPAST TWO YEARS. WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED IN THE NORTH IN THE PAST FEW DAYS NOW COMPELS US TO STATE OUT POSITION WITH COMPLETE CLARITY. 
THE VIOLENT REACTION TO THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL IN THE NORTH, WHICH IS SEEN TO BE A DELIBERATE DECISION BY THE STORMONT ADMINISTRATION TO ATTEMPT THE OUTRIGHT REPRESSION OF THE MINORITY, IS NOT SURPRISING. BUT MY GOVERNMENT MUST MAKE DECISIONS IN THE LIGHT OF THE REALITIES THAT EXIST: PARTICULARLY SO WHEN EMOTIONS RUN HIGH. THESE REALITIES INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THE MAIN VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE ARE THE PEOPLE IN AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY VICTIMISED BY THE STORMONT SYSTEM. IT IS ALREADY THE CASE THAT INNOCENT WOMEN, CHILDREN AND MEN 
OF PEACE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES SINCE MONDAY. IT IS NOT THE WISH OF THE GOVERNMENT TO BE IN ANY WAY A CAUSE OF AN ESCALATION OF AN ALREADY GRAVE SITUATION OR TO SEE ANY ADDITION TO THE TOLL OF DEATH, UNJURY AND DESTRUCTION. THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT 
, THEREFORE, 
CONDONE ANY ACTIONS WHICH WILL LEAD TO SUCH AN ESCALATION AND CANNOT AND WILL NOT SUPPORT ANY ARMED ACTIVITY WHICH WILL INEVITABLY CAUSE FURTHER SUFFERING AND DEATH. 
WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH ELECTED LEADERS OF THE NORTHERN MINORITY IN THE PAST FEW DAYS. WE ARE UNITED WITH THEM IN OUR DETERMINATION TO ENSURE THAT THE MISGOVERNMENT TO WHICH THE NORTH HAS BEEN SUBJECTED FOR SO LONG SHALL END. THE BEST METHOD OF ACHIEVING THIS OBJECTIVE IS THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS. WE HAVE NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THE SUBJECTION OF THE MINORITY IN THE NORTH TO UNJUST LAW, BIASED ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE WILL COME TO A CONCLUSION THROUGH DETERMINED POLITICAL ACTION. 
WE HOPE THE BRITISH PEOPLE WILL COME TO REALISE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF NORTHERN IRELAND IS NOW AND HAS BEEN SINCE IT WAS CREATED DIRECTED AT THE SUPPRESSION OF THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE POPULATION. WE KNOW THAT THE BRITISH PUBLIC, IF FULLY AWARE OF THE FACTS, WOULD TURN AWAY IN HORROR FROM WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO SUPPORT, FINANCIAALLY AND OTHERWISE, ALL THESE YEARS IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
THE CASE CAN BE SIMPLY STATED. THERE EXISTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND A GOVERNMENT WHOSE MAIN CONCERN APPEARS TO BE TO MEET THE WISHES AND DEMANDS OF THE MOST EXTREME ELEMENTS WITHIN THE UNIONIST COMMUNITY. THAT GOVERNMENT IS HEADED BY ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE DOWNING STREET DECLARATION WHICHGUARANTEED EQUALITY OF TREATMENT FOR EVERYONE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IRRESPECTIVE OF POLITICAL VIEWS OR RELIGION. DURING THE TWO YEARS WHICH HAVE ELAPSED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT DECLARATION HAS BEEN DELAYED AND DISTORTED. 
WHATEVER WERE THE INTENTIONS EMBODIED IN THE DECLARATION IT NOW HAS NO CREDIBILITY FOR THE NON-UNIONIST POPULATION AS THEY CAN SEE THE EXTENT OF THE INFLUENCE AND EVEN CONTROL EXERCISED ON THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT BY UNIONIST EXTREMISTS. 
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE ARE SATISFIED THAT, AS AN IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE OF POLITICAL ACTION, THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE REPLACED BY AN ADMINISTRATION IN WHICH POWER AND DECISION-MAKING WILL BE EQUALLY SHARED BETWEEN UNIONIST AND NON-UNIONIST. 
THE STORMONT REGIME, WHICH HAS CONSISTENTLY REPRESSED THE NONUNIONIST POPULATION AND BEARS RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECURRING VIOLENCE IN THE NORTHERN COMMUNITY, MUST BE BROUGHT TO AN END. WE CALL ON ALL IRISH PEOPLE, NORTH AND SOUTH, WHO ARE OPPOSED BOTH TO REPRESSION AND VIOLENCE TO JOIN TOGETHER IN POLITICAL ACTION AIMED AT THIS OBJECTIVE. 
THIS IS A SURER ROAD TO PEACE WITH JUSTICE THAN SELF-DESTRUCTIVE VIOLENCE.

PRIME MINISTER But it means of course 
t your minority and my 
minority would also have to be in. I do not know whether you would like that sort of approach, but it is either an approach between governments - if there were to be an idea of a summit - or it is to be an approach of all bodies and that would mean minority political parties, minority groupings, religious groupings and so on. 
MR. LYNCH I know it is very difficult to determine who 
represents what and who should be there. PRIME MINISTER But I think the overwhelming thing too of any of 
these sorts of meetings, applies to all sorts of summits that perhaps failure is worse than not to have it at all and you cannot ensure success until everyone has agreed what the answer is. 
MR. LYNCH Well, it is very difficult for us to have a summit 
without a reasonable prospect of some kind of the product and that would mean in effect a political product, so to speak. And I doubt if Mr. Faulkner would be very much interested in a summit of that nature. 
PRIME MINISTER I think his view has been right from the time he 
became Prime Minister as you know that he wanted to have more contacts with you and with Dublin and to build them up gradually. And the whole point about internment is to deal with the terrorism so that it is then possible to make the advance on other fronts. Until he is able to deal ith the bomb explosions and the destruction of property and the general terrorism it is impossible for him to go further than he has gone already. 
MR. LYNCH And of course there is this difficulty, that producing 
these results now, in the light of the activities of the IRA in the north, could be attributed to their activities rather than to reasonable and reasoned discussion. That is a big difficulty we have her with the Opposition M.P.’s having opted out of parliament and the IRA having taken over.

But there is also the grave danger that the IRA,

Government. 
Dr. Hillery said that he had been sent by his Cabinet to see the British He thought the current policies would lead to war in Ireland, not 
only the North. He said that the IRA had been re-created as a reaction to the 
British Government’s policies of preserving the dominance of the Orange Order. He claimed that the Orange Order still ran the Northern Ireland Government and referred to Mr. Faulkner as having gone to a secret meeting of the Orange Lodge for instructions before visiting London. 
He said that following these 
policies would destroy relations between the United Kingdom and the Republic and claimed that the urgency of the situation was not appreciated by the United Kingdom Government. The Home Secretary said that the policy of the United Kingdom Government 
was to support the lawfully and democratically elected Government in Northern Ireland.

Internment had been introduced because the Government was faced with It was in the common interest of both 
countries to combat the activities of gunmen and it was hoped that the Government of the Republic would be able to help achieve that objective.

The Home Secretary said thatthe army was under the control of He knew that the orders given to the soldiers provided for them 
to act impartially and he was satisfied that they did not shoot without reason. Dr. Hillery said that the army had originally gone into Northern Ireland to protect the Catholics but its role had changed and the Catholics now saw the army as having taken the place of the ’B’ Specials. 
He said that the raid on 
the Falls Road, which had been peaceful for a year after the army had moved in, was a critical mistake. 
The Home Secretary said that it was not that the 
role of the army had changed but that circumstances had changed in that the army found itself attacked by terrorists from Catholic areas. did not know or care about the affiliations of someone sniping at him. 
He 
emphasised that the bombing, the murder and the withdrawal of the Opposition from Stormont had all taken place before internment had been introduced. The Home Secretary suggested that the IRA had deliberately intensified operations to frustrate progress which was being made earlier this year. 
The soldier While 
posing as protectors of the Catholic community they were bringing it death and destruction. Dr. Hillery suggested that those interned were mostly talkers rather than 
terrorists. He complained that only Catholics had been interned and argued that Protestant snipers who had killed in the past couple of nights had not been dealt with. 
He referred to the number of licensed guns in Protestant hands 
and alleged that the police and army have stated that they will not go to certain areas where Catholics might need to be protected. 
The Home Secretary 
replied that all those arrested under the internment operation were people who the security forces believed to be active in terrorism. 
Some might also 
be engaged in more reputable political activity but this was not a reason for their internment. 
the people arrested would be those suspected of IRA activities few of whm As the terrorism was conducted by the IRA it followed that

Dr. Hillery intervened to refer to 2,200 refugees in camps in The Home Secretary replied that if it were not for the IRA 
campaign these people would still be in their own homes. It should be clearly 
understood that they were the victims of the IRA. The Home Secretary said that he must ask Dr. Hillery to do all he could to 
help in the campaign against the IRA who train, organise and find refuge south of the border. 
Dr. Hillery said that this could not be proved. The Home 
Secretary referred to two incidents in one of which a member of the UDR had been shot dead from across the border and stated that Brady and Goulding gloried in their activities from the sanctity of the Republic. 
It would be politically impossible for the Irish Dr. Hillery

the political difficulties facing his Government, Dr. Hillery said that for two years Mr. Lynch"had been seen to drift along on a half hope all of his own creation". The Home Secretary said that he had been told by many eminent Catholics 
that the reform programme now being carried out removed genuine grievances. The Home Secretary said that he was intent on sustaining the Parliament 
of Northern Ireland, not as an instrument of Unionist domination but as a democratically elected assembly through which the opportunities of participation for the minority, as suggested by Mr. Faulkner, might be possible. 
This 
position was one of justice and reality, bearing in mind that the Catholic community in Northern Ireland was a minority. regarded Stormont as finished.

The Press - particularly Leader Writers - have on the 
whole accepted the inevitability of the use of special powers in Northern Ireland and their attitude has been constructive. As the disturbances have continued since Monday morning, there has been a slight decline of confidence 
- largely from the 
mistaken assumption at the out set that the use of internment would remove all terrorists and intimidation. 
position has been clear enough. It was accepted at the 
beginning that you had no alternative but to embark on Saturday and that all decisions had been taken before your departure. As the disturbances continue, however, there has been a growing feeling that you should be in London, culminating in a major Daily Mail "Comment" today "Urgent: A Helicopter for Mr. Heath", which demands a tripartite television broadcast by yourself, Lynch and Faulkner following a meeting in London. 
The theme is "H.M.G. has firmly and rightly supported Mr. Faulkner ... but he cannot restore confidence on 
his own". You have in any case decided to return to London at once 
and the Press has been told this. This will hold the 
situation well enough, but you may be accosted by the Press in Plymouth - Who will not be politically sophisticated and who should therefore be approached with care. 
Above all, we 
have not attempted to destroy the impression that you have been kept in touch throughout with situation reports. I suggest therefore the following line:-

a long-term solution is needed - of course it is; but we are facing a short-term situation. 
Only when the dust has 
settled will it be possible to plan in a wider context. (6) Mr. Lynch’s initial reaction confirmed the impression he has always given that he is a man who deplores violence. Dr. Hillery has had discussions with Mr. Maudling this morning and will be reporting back to Mr. Lynch this evening (we understand). 
You will be seeing the Home Secretary or 
talking with him as soon as you return to London (and may have a word with him on the telephone from Plymouth?). You already know (I attach a note about this) the gist of what took place this morning. (7) Mr. Lynch’s original statement challenged internment as an instrument of policy and suggested it showed a bankruptcy of political ideas in Northern Ireland. 
H.M.G. supported 
the Northern Ireland Government in the view that murders and terrorists and intimidators could not be allowed to continue unchecked; although there was no doubt that the security forces could have contained the situation, it would have involved a very long haul and a deteriorating local situation. (I attach a note of the Lobby Briefing given by the Home Secretary on Monday morning). (8) There has been no great demand for a recall of Parliament and the Government sees no reason for this at this time. Any representations made - particularly of the Opposition 
from the Leader - would of course be 
seriously considered. (9) Mr. Lynch has not publicly proposed a three-part summit. He has called for discussions "among all interested parties to obtain a new form of administration for Northern Ireland". You are not able at this stage to make any further comment on the discussions with Dr. Hillery this morning. I would however emphasise the desirability of implying 
that you have been kept in touch; although you can reitterate that all necessary decisions were taken before your departure and that there has as yet been no unforeseen development requiring a decision on your part. 
Obviously you will now To those who suggest that

be considering the latest development - the views of the Eire Government as expressed by Dr. Hillery. 
Of course you 
deplore all that has happened over the weekend and since in acts of terrorism and senseless killing of innocent persons. Your hope is that by removing the terrorist elements from the active political scene, it will be possible for the communities of Northern Ireland to get a sense of nerspective and balance.

9 AUGUST 
1. MR FAULKNER, THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND, ANNOUNCED THIS MORNING, 9 AUGUST, THAT AFTER WEIGHING ALL THE RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING THE VIEWS OF THE SECURITY AUTHORITIES, AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, THE NORTHERN IRELAND COVERNENT HAD DECIDED TO ACTIVATE ITS POWERS OF INTERNMENT. THE SECURITY FORCES ARE ACCORDINGLY DETAINING PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERRORISM, AT THE SAME TIME A BAN ON ALL MARCHES AND PARADES WAS ANNOUNCED: THIS BAN, WHICH IS INITIALLY FOR-SIX MONTHS, COVERS A MAJOR PROTESTANT EVENT WHICH HAD BEEN DUE THIS WEEK, THE APPRENTICE BOYS’ MARCH IN LONDONDERRY. 
2. THIS DECISION HAS BEEN MADE IN THE LIGHT OF IRA ACTIVITY WHICH HAS INCREASED BOTH IN VOLUME AND IN THE VICIOUSNESS OF THE ATTACKS ON THE SECURITY FORCES AND SOCIETY IN NORTHERN IRELAND. IN ADDITION TO THOSE KILLED BY GUNMEN, EXPLOSIVES HAVE BEEN USED AGAINST POLICE STATIONS, AND ALSO BARS, AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES WHERE CASUALTIES AMONGST ORDINARY CITIZENS WERE INEVITABLE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED INCREASE IN THE WEIGHT AND QUANTITY OF EXPLOSIVES BEING USED, AND A CROWING NUMBER OF ATTACKS ON COMMERCIAL PREMISES IN BELFAST. THESE HAVE INCLUDED FOR THE FIRST TIME WELL-PLANNED OPERATIONS BY GANGS OF UP TO A DOZEN MEN, WHICH SHOWS THE GROWING CONFIDENCE -WITH WHICH THE IRA IS NOW OPERATING. ALL THE EVIDENCE INDICATES A DELIBERATE IRA POLICY TO DISTURB SOCIETY IN THE NORTH, DESTROY ECONOMIC LIFE AND DISCREDIT THE STORMONT GOVERNMENT, 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
3. ALL IMMEDIATE ADDRESSEES SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE FOREGOING IS AS APPROPRIATE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO WHICH THEY ARE ACCREDITED, AND THE REASONS BEHIND THE DECISION APPRECIATED. OTHER POSTS HAVE DISCRETION TO DO LIKEWISE. ALL SHOULD IN ADDITION ENSURE THAT.PRESS AND TV ARE FULLY BRIEFED.

4. YOU MAY AS APPROPRIATE DRAW UPON THE FOLLOWING POINTS: A. INTERNMENT IS AIMED ONLY AGAINST INDIVIDUALS 
CONDUCTING 
VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM, AND NOT AGAINST A RELIGIOUS MINORITY. THE MEASURES TAKEN WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, EXCEPT AS THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION MAKE INEVITABLE. (ATTRIBUTABLE) 
B. THE SECTARIAN RIOTING OF 1969 IS NOW LONG PAST. WHAT WE NOW FACE IS ARMED ATTACKS BY THE IRA. (ATTRIBUTABLE) 
C. THE SECURITY FORCES DEAL WITH ANY LAW-BREAKING BY EXTREMIST PROTESTANTS AS FIRMLY AS THEY DEAL WITH SIMILAR TROUBLE COMING FROM ROMAN CATHOLIC ELEMENTS. (ATTRIBUTABLE) 
D. VIOLENCE HAS THROUGHOUT BEEN CONDEMNED BY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. (UNATTRIBUTABLE) 
E. MR LYNCH, THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE IRISH REPUBLIC, HAS ALSO BEEN FORTHRIGHT IN HIS CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE, MOST RECENTLY IN A.SPEECH OF 8 AUGUST. (UNATTRIBUTABLE) 
F. THE IRA’S TWO FACTIONS, BRADYITES AND GOULDINGITES, BOTH PROFESS A REVOLUTIONARY CREED, AND THE LATTER’S PROGRAMME IS AVOWEDLY MARXIST. ALTHOUGH UNTIL RECENTLY THE BRADYITES HAVE TENDED TO BE THE MORE VIOLENT, THE GOULDINGITES HAVE IN RECENT WEEKS BEEN ACTIVE IN CAUSING VIOLENCE IN THE NORTH AND ALSO ATTACKS ON FOREIGN PROPERTY IN THE IRISH REPUBLIC ITSELF. (UNATTRIBUTABLE) 
G. IRA VIOLENCE HAS MADE RECOURSE TO INTERNMENT NECESSARY ON EARLIER OCCASIONS. THE NORTHERN. IRELAND GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED INTERNMENT DURING THE LAST WAR AND IN 1957-61. (UNATTRIBUTABLE) 
H. THOSE HELD WILL, WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD, EITHER BE CHARGED BEFORE A COURT, RELEASED, OR MADE THE SUBJECT OF AN INTERNMENT ORDER. (ATTRIBUTABLE) 
I. INTERNEES CAN MAKE REPRESENTATIONS TO AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE.

DICTATED BY EXTREME PROTESTANTS AND CONSITS OF IMPOSING THE STATUS QUO ON THE CATHOLICS, IT IS A SECTARIAN ACT WHICH WILL RALLY ALL CATHOLICS NORTH AND SOUTH BEHIND THE INTERNEES AND AGAINST US. HENCE MR LYNCH IS OBLIGED SIMULTANEOUSLY TO OPEN UP REFUGEE CAMPS IN THE SOUTH AND CALL FOR A CONFERENCE OF ALL INTERESTED PARTIES ON THE SITUATION IN THE NORTH. 6. I CANNOT OF COURSE COMMENT ON THE EFFECT IN THE NORTH, BUT I AM SURE IT WOULD HAVE A STEADYING EFFECT IN THE SOUTH IF, IN ADDITION TO THE DETAILS SUGGESTED IN MY TEL NO 302, H.M.G. COULD TAKE UP MR FAULKNER’S APPEAL TO THE CATHOLICS (FINAL PARAGRAPH OF HIS STATEMENT OF 9 AUGUST) BY STATING VERY CLEARLY THAT INTERNMENT IS ONLY A MEANS TO AN END AND THAT THIS END IS THE RAPID CREATION OF A SOCIETY FROM WHICH DISCRIMINATION AND INJUSTICE HAD BEEN ELIMINATED. IF H.M.G. CAN COMMIT THEMSELVES PUBLICLY TO A GUARANTEE THAT MR FAULKNER’S FINE WORDS WILL BE RAPIDLY TRANSLATED INTO SPECIFIC AND PRACTICAL AS DISTINCT FROM PAPER REFORMS, INTERNMENT WILL BE SEEN HERE TO HAVE AN EXPLICIT POSITIVE PURPOSE AS WELL AS THE NEGATIVE ONE OF ENDING TERRORISM, 7. I HAVE JUST LEARNED FROM THE D F A THAT DR HILLERY IS SEEING THE HOME SECRETARY AND MR GODBER TOMORROW. MINISTERS HAVE BEEN MEETING ALL MORNING 
, ARE NOW SEEING S.D.L.P. REPRESENTATIVES 
AND WILL THEN RESUME. I AM ASSURED THAT THEIR PRESENT AIM IS TO DO ALL IN THEIR POWER TO DEFUZE THE SITUATION.

That is his judgment of the situation, and of course 
the decision is his, though he has reached it after consultation with us. 
For our part, we made it clear that 
there could be no question of our accepting internment, and instructing our forces to help to implement it, if it was not accompanied by a complete ban on marches and parades of all kinds; and we have made clear our present view that that ban will need to remain in force for longer than six months, though the extension beyond six months remains formally open for discussion. 7. 
We realise that these decisions carry their dangers as 
well as their advantages for Northern Ireland; and I am well aware of their implications and dangers for you. Clearly the effectiveness of internment in Northern Ireland could have been increased if you had felt able to take similar measures on your side of the border.

situation by the means employed Faulkner’s 
judgment was that the consequences of that for the community would be worse than the consequences of what is now proposed. 
There is also the fact that the intimidation 
of the population by the terrorists has been increasingly hampering the process of gathering intelligence 6. 
The decision is, of course, Faulkner’s, since the 
powers under which these measures are taken are powers of the Northern Ireland Government. 
But implementation 
depends upon the co-operation of the units of the British Army in Northern Ireland, and he has decided as he always said he would, after consultation with us. 
For our part, 
we are of course very concerned about the degree to which our Forces are committed in Northern Ireland, and the implication of that for our military capability elsewhere. If this move enables us to reduce the number of troops committed to Northern Ireland earlier than we could otherwise have done, that will be a welcome consequence of it. 
But 
we have made it clear to Faulkner that there could be no question of our accepting internment, and instructing our

MESSAGE TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORTHERN IRELAND FROM THE HOME SECRETARY 
I said I would set out the position as clearly as I can. The decision whether to proceed to internment is yours to make under the 
Constitution but it is our mutual understanding, particularly in view of the involvement of UK forces, that such a decision would be agreed beforehand with us. You had yourself often said, and I have supported this view, that you would be guided by the recommendations of the security authorities. 
As I understand it the GOC is not in present circumstances recommending 
internment on military grounds. This of course is the basis on which he would advise Ministers of either Government who would be responsible for the decision. It would be for them to take into account the political considerations which are numerous and complex. 
I understand that pressure for internment is considerable and I agree that 
it may well become necessary. I have stated in public that we would raise no objection to internment if we were satisfied on the advice of the security authorities and after consultation with you on the wider aspects that this would help in the campaign against the IRA. I have further stressed that no prior announcement would be possible or desirable. This remains our position. 
We must look at the immediate situation against the background of the 
Apprentice Boys march on 12 August. If internment were introduced before then it would in our view be essential to proceed simultaneously with the indefinite banning of all political processions. I understand it is the GOC’s view on military grounds that he would not advise the banning of the procession. If the procession is to proceed it seems to me to be wiser to postpone any decision about internment until after it has taken place when we can review the situation again on the existing principles and wholly without prejudice to a decision either way. As so much attention has been paid to this march on 12 August its outcome one way or another will be of considerale significance for any decision about the future conduct of the campaign against the terrorists. 
This is the position as I see it. I should be most grateful for your comments. 
As I said, I would be very happy to see you if you would care to come and discuss it here but I rather share your view that the publicity attending such a visit would inevitably create a very difficult situation.

Practical Effectiveness in Northern Ireland 6. 
Internment, if it can be made effective on the basis of being limited to 
Northern Ireland, should have a damaging effect on the IRA’s operations, although it would be unlikely to put an end to terrorism completely. 
But 
it would also lead to retaliation, not only in the form of rioting but also by way of taking hostages both in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain. You will want specifically to ascertain the views of the GOC and the Chief Constable. 
by a ban of the Apprentice Boys’ march on 12th August. Political Impact in Northern Ireland 7. 
It seems essential that a decision to intern should be accompanied Internment would strengthen Mr. Faulkner’s position; but at some 
long-term cost. Mr. Lynch is probably right in saying that it would lead to greater polarisation of opinion and that it would make it harder to promote policies of co-operation and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Ways and Means 8. 
at 48 hours’ notice and 300 at 14 days’ notice. 
It was reported last week that HMS Maidstone could take 150 internees Up to 150 could be taken at 
Long Kesh by September; and a further 300 in November. Plans have been made to accommodate in prisons and in HMS Maidstone all the suspects whom we would be able to take (about 250) until Long Kesh was ready. 9. 
You will wish to enquire about the procedure: whether the suspects 
would immediately be interned or held pending internment or trial on a criminal charge. Has the Home Secretary any idea how long internment would be likely to last? Could the courts cope? And what machinery is there for reviewing cases ? 10. 
If Parliament rises before the decision is announced, no doubt there will be a clamour for its recall! Do we ignore it?

PEOPLE AND INTERN 20 BECAUSE THEY ARE BAD, YOU IMMEDIATELY MAKE BAD PEOPLE OF THE OTHER 99 UNQUOTE: WITH THE EXTREME UNIONISTS APPARENTLY ON THE RAMPAGE, ALL THE MODERATES WOULD IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WITH THE INTERNEES. (THIS OF COURSE IS THE ESSENCE OF HIS ARGUMENT THAT THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE SECURITY SITUATION IS POLITICAL, AND HE CANNOT BE SHAKEN ON THIS). 
4. I THEN REFERRED TO THE ULTIMATE POSSIBILITY OF DIRECT RULE, AND ASKED HIM HOW HE FELT ABOUT THAT. PARA 1 OF MY TELNO 284 GIVES A VERY FAIR SUMMARY OF THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS REPLY. WHEN I PRESSED HIM HE SAID HE WOULD PREFER IT TO A GENERAL ELECTION AND A PAISLEY-LED GOVERNMENT. BUT HE REVERTED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM OF THE UNWISDOM OF INTERNMENT, SAYING THAT SURELY WE HAD ENOUGH TROOPS, POLICE, AND INTELLIGENCE RESOURCES TO MANAGE WITHOUT IT. HIS GOVERNMENT ON THE OTHER HAND HAD VERY FEW OF EACH 
- A POINT WHICH ENABLED ME TO TOUCH ON CO-OPERATION ALONG THE BORDER. 
5. MR. LYNCH’S VIEW ON THIS WAS THAT POLICE CO-OPERATION WAS FUNCTIONING DISCREETLY: THERE WERE NO MEANS OF ORGANISING ANY PLANNED MILITARY CO-OPERATION, BUT IF AD HOC AND BY CHANCE A PATROL ONE SIDE OF THE BORDER PASSED A FRIENDLY WORD TO ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE, NO HARM WOULD BE DONE. I THINK THIS WAS A CASUAL REMARK WITHOUT GREAT SIGNIFICANCE, AND THE FACT IS THAT POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS APART, THE IRISH DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MILITARY RESOURCES FOR PLANNED AND COORDINATED PATROLLING. 
6. FINALLY MR. LYNCH ASKED ME WHEN A DECISION WAS LIKELY TO BE TAKEN ON INTERNMENT. I QUOTED (PARA 2 OF YOUR TELNO 147) THAT IT MIGHT ARISE AT ANY TIME FROM NOW ON, BUT WHEN HE ASKED IF IT WAS LIKELY THIS WEEKEND I SAID I THOUGHT NOT.

TO IMMEDIATE 0 TELEGRAM NUMBER 284 OF 29 JULY, INFO IMMEDIATE 
TO UKREP BELFAST. M.I.P.T.: DIRECT RULE. 1. THE IRISH GOVERNMENT’S ATTITUDE TO DIRECT RULE IS FLUID AND AT TIMES SCHIZOPHRENIC. ON THE ONE HAND, THEY WOULD WELCOME IT IF IT PREVENTED A STORONT GOVERNMENT LED BY CRAIG OR PAISLEY: OR IF IT MARKED THE END OF UNIONIST RULE IN STORMONT: AND AS EVIDENCE THAT HMG ACCEPTED THAT THE 1921 SETTLEMENT WAS UNWORKABLE AND ANOTHER ’’ SOLUTION’’ HAD TO BE FOUND. ON THE OTHER HAND, DIRECT RULE WOULD MAKE MR. LYNCH’S POLICY OF SETTLING THE PARTITION PROBLEM BETWEEN TWO IRISH ’’TRADITIONS’’ LESS PLAUSIBLE, THERE WOULD BE A DANGER THAT IN TIME NORTHERN IRELAND MIGHT BECOME EVEN MORE INTEGRATED INTO THE U.K. AND IT WOULD FINALLY REMOVE THE ARENA OF ARGUMENT FROM BELFAST, WHERE THE MINORITY AT LEAST HAVE A VOICE, TO WESTMINSTER WHERE IN EFFECT THEY DO NOT. (THIS ARGUMENT HAS LESS FORCE NOW THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS LEFT STORMONT). PUBLICLY, AND PROBABLY IN FACT, THE FORMER VIEW WOULD PREVAIL. 
2. IN THE CONTEXT OF A TALK WITH MR LYNCH ABOUT INTERNMENT, THE POINT ABOUT DIRECT RULE IS RELEVANT IN THREE CASES: FIRST AS AN ALTERNATIVE - I.E. IF HMG HAD DECIDED THAT THEY THEMSELVES WOULD NOT INTRODUCE INTERNMENT, BUT WOULD ASSUME CONTROL OF EVENTS INSTEAD: SECONDLY, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INTERNING AS MANY PROTESTANTS AS I R A EXTREMISTS, RESULTING IN THE COLLAPSE OF MR. FAULKNER’S GOVERNMENT UNDER RIGHT-WING INDIGNATION: THIRDLY, IF HMG ASSUMED DIRECT RULE AND AT THE SAME TIME INTRODUCED INTERNMENT. BUT IN ANY CASE, A DECISION TO INTRODUCE INTERNMENT, APPARENTLY TAKEN BY THE FAULKNER GOVERNMENT, WOULD BE REGARDED IN DUBLIN AS AN INSTANCE OF DIRECT RULE SINCE THE IRISH GOVERNMENT KNOW THAT THE DECISION WOULD IN EFFECT BE TAKEN IN LONDON.

prohibited; and, instead, a meeting was held on the other side of the river from the Bogside and Creggan. There were attempts to force a way across the bridges; but grave disorder was avoided. Merely to reroute the march may therefore be contrasted unfavourably with last year’s action. On the other hand it appears that the traditional route of the march differs from year to year and that there is a recognised cycle of routes. 
If so (and this should 
be confirmed), the rerouting of this year’s march away from the Bogside may be regarded as equivalent in its effects to the steps taken last year.

If it is decisively in favour of banning (But, if so, when should 
If, on the other hand, the GOC is prepared to take a 
chance in terms of security, the political advantage to Mr. Faulkner of allowing the march to take place (subject to whatever stipulations the GOC may require) should probably be the determining consideration. 5. 
In reaching their decision the Committee will need to take account of 
telegram No. 274 of 26th July from HM Ambassador in Dublin, which emphasises that the pressure from the Republic for an outright ban on the march derives not just from the IRA but from the Government itself at all levels. A ban would therefore imply capitulation to Republican views; and the Committee must consider how far this might be mitigated by the new measures of harassment of the IRA recently undertaken by the Army. 6. 
There can 
presum bly be no question of yielding to pressure of this kind. 7. 
The GOC 
On security generally you might like to ask the Home Secretary about extreme Protestant suggestions for raising a citizens’ militia. 
One cannot help feeling that if, as is commonly supposed, internment 
is the ’last stop before direct rule", we should be chary of adopting it until we are compelled to. And the Committee will wish to hear from the GOC how far he regards the new measures of harassment as in some sense an alternative to internment; and, if so, how long they are likely to remain effective for this purpose. 
rather than later, to adopt a policy of internment, two questions arise. But if we are likely to be driven, perhaps sooner First, 
how effective would internment in the North be, whether or not we could secure co-operation from Mr. Lynch? Second, how might we secure this co-operation ? 8. 
On the first of these issues the Official Committee asked for 
an assessment from the GOC on the effectiveness of internment limited to the North; and the Committee will wish to hear his opinion. A poor initial rate of arrests is perhaps not the only criterion.

(i) it is thought that at the next Stormont election Mr. Paisley will win around 16 seats; even if this does not enable him to form a Government, it will give him an important role in Stormont; there is 
therefore a case for 
trying to build up some sort of relationship with him; instead of testing him as an outsider; 
(ii) one of the main reasons why extremist views are gaining 
along Protestants is that the ’Squirearchy" is demoralised and is no longer willing to give effective leadership to the community;

21st July 1971 We have been giving fresh consideration both to the 
operational tactics to be used by the Army in Northern Ireland, and to the force level required there, during the next few weeks in the light of two factors: the increased level of IRA terrorism during recent weeks, and the march of the Protestant Apprentice Boys which traditionally takes place in Londonderry on 12th August. The Prime Minister will wish to be aware of the conclusions which have been reached. 
As you know, although the main Protestant parades of July 
passed off without giving rise to any serious incidents, there has been a significant worsening in recent weeks in the amount and nature of terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, with frequent bomb attacks on an increasing scale and also the outbreaks of extremely vicious street fighting in Londonderry where there had previously been very little trouble for many months. This activity is clearly the work of the IRA; and the GOC has confirmed that the signs are that this body is getting better organised and more efficient in its methods. Earlier this week the GOC reported to the Defence Secretary, and also to the Home Secretary, that renewed pressure was building up within Mr. Faulkner’s Government for firm action against the IRA; and Mr. Faulkner has himself been in touch with the Home Secretary to suggest that the time may have come to think again about internment. 
It would be primarily a political decision whether to 
bring in internment, but it would depend very much on military advice. The view of the GOC, with which the Defence Secretary entirely agrees, is that the arguments against resorting to internment remain very strong and that other possibilities for disrupting the IRA should certainly be tried first. On this basis the GOC has proposed a new operational approach designed to make life as difficult as possible for those people who are known to be leading IRA activists and so to give them the minimum

scope for either operating as terrorists themselves or for organising attacks and riots. He intends to do this mainly by frequently descending upon them to search their houses and, if they are actually found, by periodically arresting them on suspicion and where appropriate holding them for up to 48 hours for interrogation. The GOC believes that a policy of continuous harassment on these lines stands a good chance of disrupting the IRA’s organisation and activities to an extent that would be very valuable in both military and political terms. 
It has been confirmed that Mr. Faulkner is in favour 
of this approach; and both the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary have now approved it in principle. Lord Carrington has however stipulated that on each occasion when the new policy is put into effect it must be presented as the consequence of some recent outbreak of terrorism on the IRA’s part, rather than as an initiative on the part of the Army. 
The adoption of this operational approach has a bearing 
on the Apprentice Boys March. We understand that the present view at Stormont is that the march should be allowed to take 
place, but that the traditional route must certainly be altered so as to avoid the city walls where they look down on the Bogside (which has proved a flash-point in the past, not least in 1969). It is thought that the march organisers are much more likely to be prepared to cooperate in such re-routing if, in the meantime, some positive action is seen to be taken against IRA leaders. The GOCtherefore plans to make a start with the harassment tactics before the end of this month (which will of course be presented as a response to the recent outbreaks of violence)and he will shortly be reporting the details of these plans. 
With regard to the force level,I mentioned in my letter 
of 24th June about reinforcements for July that the GOC then considered that he would also need a temporary reinforcement of two extra units to cover 12th August in Londonderry, though this would be reviewed nearer the time. The present position is that the three extra units which were sent over for the July Orange parades have all now returned (the number of major units at present in Northern Ireland in the infantry role thus reverting to twelve); and the GOC has confirmed that he expects to need a temporary reinforcement of two units to cover the Apprentice Boys March. However, because he will in the meantime be bringing in the harassment policy he has asked to have the two extra units slightly longer than originally envisaged. Accordingly, in Lord Carrington’s absence,

detention and on 26th August the total number of detainees was 243. Many of these on HMS Maidstone refused food from 23rd August 
A number of people continue to be arrested with a view to 
until 25th August. Newspapers reported it as a protest against detention and conditions. 
10. The White Paper promised by Mr. Faulkner last week (HONIP (71) 33 page 2) was published on 20th August and reported widely in the press the following day. It gives a full account of the reforms introduced over the last two year in the context of the 1969 Downing Street declaration. 
11. Mr. Faulkner made a further attempt on 24th August to define his position and renew communication between himself and opposition groups. While he reaffirmed the constitutional position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom, he made a point of denying emphatically that internment was aimed at repressing the Roman Catholic community and said that he would continue to consider still further measures which would give the parliamentary Opposition greater participation in the running of Northern Ireland. Neither would he abandon this, he said, in the face of "those on the other side of the political spectrum who cry ’betrayal’ at every sign of change and progress in the community". He warned the Opposition against making common cause with extremists and said he was willing to approach with them the problem in a non-partisan manner. The Social Democratic and Labour Party, however, announced that they were only interested in talks involving the Westminster Government and still sought the suspension of Stormont. Mr. Devlin M.P. accused Mr. Faulkner of hypocrisy. 
12. This response only confirmed the Social Democratic and Labour Party’s concentration on activities outside the parliamentary framework with the aim that existing constitutional arrangements will be brought down. All the party’s MPs and all the Nationalist MPs met Mr. Lynch in Dublin on 23rd August. The Republican Labour M.P., Mr. Paddy Kennedy, refused the invitation,having thrown in his lot with the Dail Ulaidh (see paragraph 13). Details of the discussion were not revealed but it was reported that the meeting was amicable and a brief statement said that it had been agreed that the objective of equality of treatment for everyone in Northern Ireland should be pursued by non-violent political means. Mr. Lynch also acknowledged that the elected Opposition members were the principal representative body of the non-Unionist community. The Northern Iroland MPs later met members of the Irish Republic’s Opposition parties, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. 
13. The statement therefore makes it clear that Mr. Lynch’s 
moral support for the campaign to end Stormont does not extend to backing the proposals of the more extreme Republicans for a ninecounty Parliament (Dail Ulaidh) covering the traditional counties of Ulster. This proposal was discussed at a meeting in the Irish Republic in Monaghan on 21st August. Those present included

Association and People’s Democracy were also in evidence. Mr. Cahill hoped that Dail Ulaidh would be the first of four regional Governments and a committee, headed by Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. McManus was established to examine further the proposal for an Ulster Parliament. Many speakers condemned the Social Democratic and Labour Party, which was not present, for trying to take over Republican support. 
Unity). Members of Northern Ireland Civil Rights 
14. Another proposal for a political settlement was propounded by the Northern Ireland Labour Party which suggested that a "community government" should be formed in which Protestants and Roman Catholics would be represented. It would be headed by Mr. Faulkner, and would aim at "social reconstruction" for two years. Stormont would be prorogued for six months before returning with a stronger Senate and election to the Commons on the basis of proportional representation. Mr. Faulkner thought the general proposal unrealistic but welcomed some of the ideas. 
15. Following the withdrawal of 30 leading Roman Catholics from Londonderry’s public life (HONIP(71) 33 page 4) the GOC in Northern Ireland and Mr. Howard Smith, the United Kingdom Representative, wont to Londonderry and held a widely publicised meeting with most of the people concerned. The Roman Catholics made clear in their public statement that this was not a precursor to their return to public life. Their lead was followed by nonUnionist councillors on 20 local authorities in Northern Ireland, when the meeting in Coalisland on 22nd August,which 130 attended, announced their withdrawal and their allegiance to an alternative six county assembly. The meeting had been called by the Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Nationalist Party. 
16. Civil rights meetings continue to urge people throughout Northern Ireland to take part in a campaign of civil disobedience. Newspapers have reported that this is meeting with some success and that many Roman Catholics are withholding payment of rent. The situation is complicated by the fact that rent collectors have not visited troubled areas for some time. A Government statement said that a reduction of income must ultimately effect the public services of an area and cause hardship. While eviction or prosecution for non-payment is possible, most Roman Catholics see safety in numbers. EVENTS IN THE IRISH REPUBLIC 17. Mr. Lynch responded to Mr. Heath’s reply to his initial telegram (HONIP(71) 33 page 4) in a further statement on 20th August. He denied that many terrorists came from outside Northern Ireland, reiterated his belief that military operations were driving the communities in Northern Ireland further apart and that internment was directed not just at terrorists but at the whole non-Unionist community. He mentioned his principle that the ultimate solution was a united Ireland but said that he was convinced that all those who can contribute to a peaceful 
solution of current problems in Northern Ireland should come

20th August, 1971 Barrington sent me a copy of his letter to you of 17th August about a 
comparison between the Northern Ireland reform programme and the position in analogous areas of law and administration in the Republic. 
In the draft passage which it is suggested might be considered for 
inclusion in a letter to Mr. Lynch the reference to the reform programme as being necessary simply to curb the ambitions of extreme Protestants is something of an over-simplification. 
"Mr. Faulkner’s courage in pressing through with reforms merits far greater recognition than it has been given. 
We would suggest that these words should 
be omitted and that in one or two other places the text should be simplified a little so that it would read as follows:- 
There is an unfortunate 
tendency in much of the comment from the Republic to assert that nothing has been done. 
He and his predecessor have in fact put through measures 
which neither you in Dublin nor we in Westminster have enacted, and although it can be argued that conditions were different in Northern Ireland, this does not detract from the achievement. 
It serves no useful purpose 
to elevate in public comment the Protestant extremists to an all-powerful role. 
They have not held this role while reforms were being enacted; 
they do not hold it now; and, as the Home Secretary’s statement of 10th August 1970 made plain, they will not be allowed to hold it in the future. 
who might otherwise have the courage to stand out for progress through policies of reform." 
In the table of comparisons the argument that there is no need for an 
Ombudsman in the Republic because there is extensive and effective intervention by elected representatives on behalf of their constituents might seem to imply that Great Britain M.Ps are not so diligent and therefore it was necessary to appoint a Parliamentary Commissioner. 
I am sending copies of this letter to Barrington, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Adnrew, Ministry of Defence and Cairncross, Cabinet Office. 
To suggest otherwise is merely to foster despair amongst those J. G. PILLING P. L. Gregson Esq.

UNCLASSIFIED TO FLASH DUBLIN TELEGRAM NUMBER 171 OF 19 AUGUST INFO IMMEDIATE UKREP BELFAST. THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS THIS EVENING SENT THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE TO THE TAOISEACH. QUOTE YOUR TELEGRAM TODAY IS UNJUSTIFIED IN ITS CONTENT, UNACCEPTABLE IN ITS ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND CAN IN NO WAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF NORTHERN IRELAND. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF TREATMENT FOR EVERYONE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IRRESPECTIVE OF POLITICAL VIEWS OR RELIGION IS THE ACCEPTED POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND OF NORTHERN IRELAND AND IS BEING FULLY IMPLEMENTED. BY SEEKING TO OBSCURE THIS FACT YOU DO NO SERVICE TO ANY OF THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND. THE MILITARY OPERATIONS TO WHICH YOU REFER ARE DESIGNED SOLELY FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE PEOPLE AGAINST ARMED TERRORISTS WHOSE ACTIVITIES, MANY OF WHICH ORIGINATE IN OR ARE SUPPORTED FROM THE REPUBLIC, I HOPE YOU WOULD DEPLORE AND JOIN US IN SUPPRESSING. THESE OPERATIONS ARE THUS A NECESSARY PRELUDE TO THE RESTORATION OF GREATER HARMONY BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND. WHILE I NATURALLY WELCOME CONTACTS WITH YOU AS THE HEAD OF A FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT, AND WHILE MR. FAULKNER AND I HAVE OFTEN MADE CLEAR OUR DESIRE TO SEE GREATER CO-OPERATION BETWEEN ALL GOVERNMENTS CONCERNED IN PROMOTING THE MUTUAL PROSPERITY AND WELL-BEING OF THE PEOPLES OF NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE REPUBLIC, I CANNOT ACCEPT THAT ANYONE OUTSIDE THE UNITED KINGDOM CAN PARTICIPATE IN MEETINGS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE THE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ANY PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. I FIND YOUR REFERENCE TO SUPPORTING THE POLICY OF PASSIVE RESISTANCE NOW BEING PURSUED BY CERTAIN ELEMENTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND CALCULATED TO DO MAXIMUM DAMAGE TO THE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND WHICH IT IS OUR PURPOSE, AND I WOULD HOPE WOULD BE YOUR PURPOSE, TO ACHIEVE;

By seeking to obscure this fact you do no service to any of the people of Northern Ireland. The military operations to which you refer 
are designed solely for the defence of the people against armed terrorists whose activities, many of which originate in or are supported from the Republic, I hope you would deplore and join us in suppressing. These operations are thus a necessary prelude to the restoration of greater harmony between the communities in Northern Ireland. While I naturally welcome contacts with 
you as the head of a friendly Government, and while Mr. Faulkner and I have often made clear our desire to see greater co-operati on between all Governments concerned in promoting the 
mutual prosperity and well- being of the peoples and 
of Northern Ireland/the Republic, I cannot accept that anyone outside the United Kingdom can participate in meetings designed to promote the political development of any part of the United Kingdom. I find your reference to supporting the 
policy of passive resistance now being pursued by certain elements in Northern Ireland calculated to do maximum damage to the cooperation between the communities in Northern

SECRET 
PUBLIC SECURITY The meeting first discussed the security situation. Internment 
The Prime Minister asked Mr Faulkner for his opinion on the effect of internment on the minority community. 
MR FAULKNER said that the reaction 
of the minority community was not to be judged solely by reference to the violence that had accompanied the arrests, part of which was attributable to earlier events. 
Many members of the minority community would be relieved at the removal of IRA terrorists from their midst. The arrests 
had brought a dramatic reduction in the number of attacks on property by explosives, and the IRA in Belfast were, temporarily at any rate, seriously disorganised. 
The Border 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that any reduction in the intensity of terrorist activity in the towns would enable the Army to give greater attention to the Border; and he had instructed the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Northern Ireland, to review the studies h had previously ade on the protection of the Border with particular attention to the possibility of making unapproved roads impassable. 
MR FAULKNER agreed it was important to consider how greater attention could be given to the Border. 
No co-operation had been forthcoming, according 
to his information, from the regular army or police of the Irish Republic. He asked what progress had been made over considering the possibility of constituting a full-time unit of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). 
UDR 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that, while a full-time unit of the UDR (which would require legislation by the United Kingdom Parliament) would bring some military advantage and relieve pressure on the regular Army, the Opposition at Westminster had set their face against it and it was strongly opposed by the minority in Northern Ireland. 
The apprehensions of its possible misuse at some future time was irrational, but to press forward

with the formation of a full-time unit in the face of these apprehensions would endanger support for the UDR in its present form. 
Government were, therefore, at present inclined against the proposal. Complaints of Ill-treatment 
THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if support for the policies of the 2 Governments over internment was to be sustained in Great Britain, it was necessary to find a means to refute mischievous suggestions of deliberate brutality on the part of the security forces. 
Merely to rely on the undertaking of the 
GOC that any allegations substantiated by evidence would be investigated was ceasing to be a tenable position. A formal inquiry was inappropriate, but the suggestion, put forward in a leading article in "The Guardian" that day, that a lawyer and a doctor from Great Britain should carry out an informal investigation of complaints had much to commend it. There might also be advantage if some independent observers were invited to inspect the internment camp now approaching completion at Long Kesh before it was occupied. It was also important that prompt action should be taken to set up the advisory committee for hearing representations against internment orders. 
MR FAULKNER said that the complaints of brutality tended to centre on the action of the security forces in making the initial arrests and on the treatment of detainees in the Army’s temporary holding camps. He supported the suggestions for an informal investigation of complaints of ill-treatment and for inspection of Long Kesh. He added that there might be merit in enabling such an organisation as Amnesty International to satisfy itself over the justice of the proceedings of the advisory committee. As to the committee itself, he was in process of setting it up and had invited Judge Brown, a Northern Ireland county court judge, to preside. The apparatus of the committee would not be required until internment orders (as opposed to detention orders) had been made. 
Allegations of vindictiveness THE PRIME MINISTER said that some action should be taken to refute suggestions that detention orders had been made out of mere political vindictiveness: for example by publishing a general description of those held in order to indicate their close involvement in terrorist activity. 
The United Kingdom

Page 1 : (0,0) - (589,788)
Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
MR FAULKNER said that the view of the security forces was that it would be untimely to publish such a description, which might prejudice their chances of success in arresting the remainder of the persons whose detention was sought. But he agreed that the matter should be reconsidered. 
Interrogation and further Arrests 
THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was important that the momentum of interrogation should be maintained and that the remaining persons whose detention was sought should be arrested as soon as possible. 
MR FAULKNER said that there had been a pause in the progress of interrogation to analyse the results so far obtained, but he would impress the need for urgency on the Chief Constable. 
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, said that the review of the studies on the protection of the Border should be urgently pursued by the Secretary of State for Defence. The possibility of sending a lawyer and a doctor to conduct informal investigations of complaints should be urgently examined and the GOC should be consulted immediately. It would be important to select people who could fairly distinguish between deliberate brutality and the force that had inevitably to be used to bring violent terrorists into custody. The possibility of an independent inspection of the internment camp and the independent observation of the advisory committee system would also be pursued (although the International Red Cross might prove to be a more suitable body than Amnesty International for the latter purpose). The possibility of refuting allegations of vindictiveness in making arrests would be pursued. Information should be obtained on the timing of the plans for making further arrests, which, with the interrogation of those in custody, should be carried forward as quickly as possible. 
Relations with the Irish Republic The meeting then considered relations with the Irish Republic.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic, Mr Lynch, was due to visit London for discussions in late October. It 
was for consideration whether the visit should be brought forward, although Mr Lynch had not so far indicated any desire to do so. Although public opinion might well regard tripartite discussions between the 3 Prime Minister; as the right approach, it was constitutionally inappropriate since the United Kingdom Government were responsible for external relations. In any event the statement made by Mr Lynch the previous week seemed to make it less likely that he would wish to pursue the possibility of a tripartite meeting. 
MR FAULKNER said that he raised no objection to discussions between the Prime Minister and Mr Lynch, so long as it was clear that Northern Ireland’s position within the United Kingdom was not in issue. It was constitutionally proper for any discussions to be between the United Kingdom Government and the Government of the Irish Republic; in any event he could hardly undertake discussions with Mr Lynch in view of his failure to co-operate in any measures to remove the source of terrorism and of his support and encouragement of the present tactics of the Opposition in Northern Ireland. He for his part was indeed disposed to question whether the maintenance of the present Government in Dublin advanced our interests. It took no action against terrorism and its courts of justice were intimidated. A coalition government in Dublin might well accord better with our interests; and we should at least know where we stood with a government that was openly more hostile towards the North. Some progress had been made in discussions between officials of the Northern Ireland Government and of the Government of the Republic on electricity generation and the promotion of tourism. The scope for economic co-operation on a wider scale was at present small, although it might be enlarged on the accession of the United Kingdom and the Republic to the European Economic Communities. 
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a Government which openly advocated violence in the North might well attract some support in the United Nations. If Mr Lynch’s Government put more pressure on the IRA it was likely to lose office unless the IRA manifested a real threat to the peace of the Republic.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, said that he would consider whether the date for Mr Lynch’s visit should be brought forward. It might be salutary to take an earlier opportunity to impress on him the consequences of his Government’s unwillingness to co-operate in the suppression of terrorism and the damage his present policies caused to the possibility of effective political advance in the North. In any discussion it would be made clear that the position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom was not in issue. Meanwhile a review should be made of the matters which we should wish to put to Mr Lynch at a meeting for consideration by United Kingdom Ministers at the beginning of September: for example co-operation over the patrolling of the Border, action against the IRA in the Republic, and measures to free the courts of the Republic from intimidation. 
Possible Political Initiatives 
The Ministers finally considered the possibility of further political initiatives. 
THE PRIME MINISTER said that, whether the United Kingdom Parliament was recalled or not, the need for some political initiative would be strongly pressed in public discussion in the next few weeks; and invited Mr Faulkner to give his view of possible progress. 
MR FAULKNER said that his initiative in proposing a system of special Parliamentary Committees at Stormont, in which half the committees would be presided over by Opposition Members, had been rebuffed when the Social Democractic Labour Party had quitted Stormont in protest at the failure to hold an inquiry into the killing of rioters in Londonderry. If he were to provide an inducement to bring the Opposition back into active participation be 
- and it was hard to see what inducements there might 
- he would find himself at the mercy of repeated demands for further concessions to the minority. In June he had stated that when local government had been reorganised the possibility of reforming the Senate (for example by including nominated as well as elected members) and of the enlargement of the House of Commons would have to be considered. There was also the possibility of introducing proportional representation,

Current situation The internment operation has been a considerable success technically 
Those detained include a considerable number of both the Goulding and Brady wings of the IRA. The evidence is that both wings have been much more seriously disrupted than statements from IRA sources suggest, and while they will undoubtedly continue to give trouble, there is reasonable hope that, with increased vigilance at the border, terrorist activity wi11 now be at a lower level than in the weeks before internment. 2. 
But internment is only a means to an end: and the political and social consequences have been serious - more serious than many people Is 
Northern Ireland expected. It is too soon to reach conclusions about the permanence of public reaction, but there has undoubtedly been a greater polarisation between the two communities. 3. 
The reaction on the part of the minority to the decision to ban the 
marches, starting with the Apprentice Boys, has been disappointing. We have not done well in the propaganda battle, and the impression has bees widely given that the Army’s role has changed and that it is now there to maintain the dominance of the Unionist majority and to concentrate its attentions on the Roman Catholic minority. 4. 
The morale of moderate Roan Catholics is low and many of those who 
have been giving service to public bodies are wondering whether they can carry on. So far, there has been little response to the civil rights call for strikes, except in Londonderry, and the trade union leadership is trying to counter it. But it will be touch and go; and industrialists are becoming increasingly worried. There is a danger that the recent call for civil disobedience, now officially endorsed by the opposition and supported

are bound to encourage despair, and to result in irresponsible and splintered groups of opposition members. Then, secondly, there is the fact that many members of the minority do not believe in the continued separate existence of the country. The Swiss, for example, have a constitution which guarantees rights for different communities; but they all do want to remain Swiss. Nor are they divided on religious grounds. What is to be done 8. 
The learned commentators in the press have produced various solutions, 
but none of them carry conviction. The ’Sunday Times’ for example have suggested re-drawing the border; but this has often been looked at, and is open to obvious and fatal objections. Any move forward must turn on some political initiative; and this can only be impeded so long as violence and intimidation continue. 9. 
The opposition, and at the other extreme unenlightened Unionists, are 
tending to force the country towards direct rule, that is, into a situation where participation at the executive and advisory level might be more equitable but political participation in Government would no longer exist. Mr.Lynch’s position, which condemns Stormont and suggests some form of 50:50 commission which cannot conceivably be claimed to be based on any democratic principle, also seems to point to direct rule. What he is proposing is obscure, and he is said to be at work on clarifying it. But there seems to be no doubt that he is urging the end of Parliamentary government and the introduction of sane kind of nominated body with executive authority; which would be a strange and undemocratic half-way house to direct rule from Westminster. His attitude affords encouragement to the Roman Catholic minority in the North to pursue courses which would make opposition participation in parliamentary government even more unlikely than it is at present. 10. 
If any progress is to be made, it will have to be by means of shaking 3

PRIME MINISTER At the weekend you were thinking of sending a letter 
to Mr. Lynch which would:- 
(i) remind him in detail of the substantial progress made in reform in Northern Ireland; 
(ii) underline this by making comparisons with the position in analogous areas of law and administration in the Irish Republic; 
(iii) tell Mr. Lynch that by his failure to recognise the progress and give credit for it to the Stormont Government he is merely strengthening the hand of the extremists and making it much more difficult to achieve the reconciliation towards which we are all 
supposed to be working. 
because of the need to do the point by point comparison with the Irish Republic which is now attached at Annex A. However now that the comparison has been made the view of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office is that not much can be made of this point. They argue as follows. Mr. Lynch is open to criticism for withholding credit due to Stormont for the measures of reform in recent years, but it is difficult to pin on the Republic the sort of charges which made the Reform Programme in Northern Ireland so necessary. Where the Republic does not follow Stormont in having legislation forbidding an abuse it is because, as in the U.K. , 
The draft has taken slightly longer than was expected that abuse is not 
practised. The "special position" of the Roman Catholic Church (guaranteed by Article 44(2) of the Constitution) 
is, to many both British and Irish a stultifying and anachronistic influence, but except in certain fields of education, there is no religious discrimination in any area of public life. Although the Protestant minority is only 5%, the first President of the Republic was a Protestant, and so is the present Minister of Health (and Deputy Prime Minister), Mr. Erskine Childers. All three political parties embrace all religious sects, and Members of Parliament are elected by Proportional Representation. It follows that using a tu quoque argument with Mr. lynch cannot be sustained and would not help.

that your remarks have made much 
more difficult the task of all of us who want to see people of both communities in Northern Ireland sharing the benefits and undertaking some of the responsibilities of an ordered society, and can only strengthen the hand of the extremists. We must bring violence to an end, and internment has been introduced only as a means of achieving this. You have yourself recognised on occasion that it is a necessary means to an end in certain circumstances. The real need is the full participation of the minority community in the public life of Northern Ireland and I am anxious that they should take advantage of the opportunities now open to them to do so. I would hope that your influence could be brought to bear in this direction by recognising that these opportunities now exist. I would hope too that you should give credit to Stormont for introducing them; they are hardly the mark of a repressive Government. I am writing to you very frankly. It is not my present 
intention to make any statement in reply to your own, because I believe that a public argument between our two governments will only delay a solution.

Internment is not appropriate in the case of those people who 
may have been guilty of indiscriminate or malicious violence, and I am satisfied that the ordinary processes of law are sufficient to deal with the great majority of them. Why then should the same processes of law not have their way with 
members of the I.R.A.? In many cases, of course, the law has caught up 
with them and about 40 members of the organisation are at present serving prison sentences, but they represent only a small proportion of membership and further steps had to be taken. 
When one is dealing with an armed 
conspiracy it may be necessary to take pre-emptive action rather than wait until those involved can be caught red-handed. 
When I.R.A. groups emerge 
from concealment for an attack the security forces are always in a position to engage or capture and if open confrontation occurs there is always, as we know, an appalling risk of innocent people being injured or killed. There comes a stage when a government cannot afford to wait until known terrorists choose the moment to strike. 
Furthermore, intimidation had made 
it more and more difficult to get witnesses to give evidence against members of the I.R.A. 
It was clearly intolerable that they should be able any 
longer by this means to place themselves effectively beyond the law. It is alleged that internment is being directed against the Catholic 
section of the population. This is simply untrue. It is directed against 
an unlawful and ruthless association, whose clear aim it is to overthrow by force of arms the constitution and laws of Northern Ireland. Internment involves the Catholic community only to the extent that 
some, I say some, member of that community have become involved in I.R.A. activity.

It is also claimed that in order to be seen to be impartial the 
Government should proceed to intern criminal elements of the Protestant community. 
There are criminals in both communities who may have 
committed serious offences during the disturbances of recent years. They are subject to the same rigours of the law as any other criminal and many so-called extreme Protestants are at present serving heavy sentences. Others who may have taken part in recent disturbances will be brought to justice when they have been identified and the facts investigated. 
I 
repeat that internment is being confined to members of unlawful associations committed to violence against whom the ordinary law has, in present circumstances, proved ineffective. The Special Powers Regulations provide for the setting up of an 
Advisory Committee to consider representations from internees. His Honour 
Judge Brown has agreed to act as Chairman of this Committee. It will be open to any internee, and all have been informed of their 
rights, to put his case to the Committee, verbally or in writing, or by both means. 
If he wishes to have legal advice in submitting a written case 
he may do so and the Government has arranged that financial arrangements similar to those available under the legal aid scheme will be applicable. The Committee’s main function will be to assess whether or when the internee’s release can be safely permitted, and much will depend on whether or not they can accept any undertaking on his part that he will not engage in violence on his release. 
The Committee will make their recommendations to the Minister of Home Affairs.

will depend on two factors; namely, the credibility of any undertaking an individual may give as to his future behaviour if he were to be released in advance of any general release, and in the other cases, the restoration of normal law and order in the community. I should add the warning that so long as the present situation 
prevails it will be necessary for the protection of decent people that the present policy be pursued. 
This means that the relentless pursuit 
of those members of the I.R.A. still on the wanted list will continue. The Government has introduced internment solely for the protection 
of the citizens of Northern Ireland. I hope, therefore, that those who, 
for reasons which I respect, are opposed to internment whatever the circumstances will also use their influence to bring to an end the conditions which have made internment necessary. 
The return to normal conditions 
will mean not only the release of internees but also the restoration to the community at large of the right to a quiet and peaceful life which the campaign of the terrorists is denying them.

PRIME MINISTER ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT You asked me to look into the possibilities for 
modifying the size and structure of the Ulster Defence Regiment, having regard to the pressures on Mr. Faulkner for more vigorous enforcement of law and order and for greater opportunities to participate in the protection of property against bomb attacks by terrorists. 
2. Taking first the question of the size of the regiment, 
since January this year we have been working to a ceiling of 6,000. However, despite vigorous attempts to attract recruits so as to reach this number, the present strength stands only at about 4,200. There is no reason to suppose that simply raising the ceiling would have the effect of increasing the flow of recruits, and it would be obvious both to Mr. Faulkner and to the public that a statement which said only that the ceiling was being raised would have no practical effect. It has therefore been necessary to consider whether there are any particular disincentives to recruitment that we might be able to remove. 
3. We should be under no illusions that the main reason 
why more people have not come forward to join the regiment (at least so far as the Protestants are concerned) is that it is not under the control of Stormont - coupled with the vetting procedures which exist to screen out would-be recruits who are known to have engaged in inter-communal thuggery in the past. Since we have no intention of divorcing the UDR from control by the Army, and hence by the British Government, that disincentive must and should remain. However, it is possible that there exists a limited number of right-minded people who would be more inclined to join the regiment if it provided more opportunity for service near home and for protecting local utilities and other such targets against attack. 
As at present constituted, the members of the UDR are theoretically liable to carry out their duties anywhere in the Province

Thank you for your letter of 26th August about the Prime Minister’s meeting with the Belfast Corporation. of declaring a state of emergency. 
I enclose a note about the possibility As you will see, the legislation is 
designed to enable the Government to maintain essential services (such as power and food supplies) if these are threatened by industrial or other action; it would not be appropriate or useful to invite it to deal with the threat to life and property posed by terrorist attacks. We have told Mr. Howard Smith that the Lord Mayor had commented that He will remedy this.

Conclusion 
4. The Governor could not declare a state of emergency at present since terrorism does 
not threaten to deprive the community of the essentials of 
life. Nor, if he did so, would the additional powers available during the emergency be of any help in combatting terrorism. If, however, power supplies were threatened by sabotage, the Governor might declare an 
emergency so that regulations could be made controlling the use of electricity (as was done in Great Britain during the strike last winter). We know that the Northern Ireland Government have contingency plans for the use of emergency powers in some circumstances.

The Northern Ireland Prime Minister (Mr Brian Faulkner) this morning invited Mr John Taylor, Minister of State at the Ministry of Home Affairs, to discuss with him Mr Taylor’s speech at Fivemiletown last night. The policy of the Government of Northern Ireland on security manpower, as stated by the Prime Minister on a number of occasions, is as follows. 
1. There is a clear need to recruit and deploy substantial further numbers of men to strengthen border security, protect important installations and make the task of the terrorist much more difficult. 
2. This need is fully appreciated by the United Kingdom Government with which urgent measures to meet it are being discussed. 
3. It is the Government’s view that the existing reserve security forces 
- the Ulster Defence Regiment and RUC Reserve - can be strengthened and made more effective. 
4. The United Kingdom Government have made it clear that there can be no question cf raising any additional armed force for the security of Northern Ireland except with their agreement and consent. 
This decision has been 
accepted by the Northern Ireland Government on the understanding that the security needs of Northern Ireland ill be fully met. 
5. Any encouragement to form a force of any sort other than one lawfully constituted would do the greatest possible damage to the vital interests of Northern Ireland. 
Mr Taylor has made it clear to the Prime Minister that he is fully in support of this policy.

desirable that there should be no reference on the order to grounds not connected with terrorism, such as allegations that the person concerned had stirred up anti-Northern Ireland Government feeling. 
Mr. Woodfield 
had indicated to officials that a United Kingdom Minister would not be prepared to act on the basis of the information which he had seen. It was admitted that the exercise had not been very well prepared. 
It appeared 
that only 12-20 of the people at present detained would be released when Internment Orders were made. Mr. Faulkner had two of the three members for the Advisory Committee 
Judge Brown, a County Court Judge in Northern Ireland, and a businessman. The Lord Chancellor’s Office had reluctantly suggested names for an English lawyer, but it was difficult to find a Q.C. who was prepared to serve under a Northern Ireland County Court Judge. 
The Northern Ireland Government 
intended to keep all the activities of the Advisory Committee secret so that it would not be known who had appealed and what the results of the appeals would be. 
Mr. Woodfield had told them that this would not be acceptable. The Home Secretary said that it would not be practicable to delay 
signing Internment Orders until after the tripartite talks on 27th/28th September. 
a right of appeal. Until the Orders were signed none of those concerned would have It should be agreed that Mr. Faulkner should aim to sign the Orders in the middle of this week. The United Kingdom Government’s 
position should be that all reasonable people agreed that those actively associated with terrorism should be locked up. 
The United Kingdom Government 
would prefer to use the normal processes of law for this purpose, but the situation in Northern Ireland made this impracticable. 
As internment had 
been resorted to it was right to give all those confined access to the Appeal Tribunal. 
Internment Orders were therefore being made against all who were alleged to be actively associated with the I.R.A. Anyone who contested this

INTERVIEW WITH MR WEST 15. 
Mr West, the Minister for Agriculture and the most right wing 
member of Mr Faulkner’s Cabinet, said in a radio interview on 29 August that he was satisfied with Mr Faulkner’s policies at the moment. He thought Mr Paisley had recently made errors of judgement which had reduced Mr Paisley’s support. He spoke harshly both of Mr Lynch, whose attempts at interference he deplored and of Mr Wilson for his statements on internment (see HONIP(71) 34 paragraph 2). He also said he would oppose any move for allowing what he described as declared enemies of the constitution to sit in the Cabinet. He was clearly referring to some of the more radical suggestions for increasing non-Unionist participation in Government. 
REFUSALS OF ENTRY TO EXTREMISTS 16. 
Mr Rory Brady, widely recognised as the leader of the 
Provisional faction of the IRA although he admits only to leading the political wing of the Provisional movement (Sinn Fein) was refused entry to England and returned to the Irish Republic on 28 August. Newspapers reported that it was decided that no criminal charges could be brought against him and he was returned on the grounds that his presence was not in the interests of national security. 
17. Mr Joe Cahill (see HONIP(71) 33 page 3) was held on his

BRITISH POLICY IN NORTHERN IRELAND (Note by the Central Policy Review Staff) 
In 1969 and 1970 successive British Governments had a well-defined policy on Northern Ireland. Its prospects of success were promising; its assumptions were reasonable; it commanded bipartisan respect at Westminster; and it was supported by the moderate men at the head of the Governments in Belfast and Dublin. Through no fault of our own, that policy has failed. It is important to be absolutely clear about what we were trying to achieve; about the completeness of our failure; and about our need for a new policy if we are not simply to flounder. 
2. The 1969-70 policy arose from the Stormont Government’s failure 
to maintain order with its own resources. It had to call in the British Army. The Westminster Government demanded a major concession in return. That concession was the Reform Programme, designed to remove the basis for Catholic grievances. It was recognised that this Programme would be unpopular with the Protestant majority which had elected the Unionist Government at Stormont. But in 1969 the next Stormont elections were still four years away. In the interval it was hoped that there would be time for the Programme to take effect; for the Catholic community to be reconciled to Unionist rule; and for the Protestant community to discover that Reform could bring peace without endangering their way of life. It would then be possible for the moderate Unionists, lead by e.g. Chichester Clark or Faulkner, to win the 1973 elections and to defeat any extremist Protestant challenge led by e.g. Craig or Paisley. 
3. One element in this policy has worked out well. Contrary to see 
Files\\SKD_round1\\PREM 15 480\\IMG_5639_PREM_15_480 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
expectations, the Stormont Government has kept its bargain and carried through the Reform Programme. But everything else has gone wrong. Perhaps unreasonably, the Catholics’ sense of grievance has not been removed. Despite an exemplary performance, the Army has not been able to maintain order. Protestant support for Craig-Paisley extremism has almost certainly increased. It is probably fair to see the sinister hand or the IRA behind each of these three failures. But diseases, once caught, cannot be cured by simply identifying the source of infection. Unpalatable political facts have to be faced, even if they have been brought about by a small number of unscrupulous ruffians. The chances of reconciling the Catholic minority to continued Unionist rule are now minimal. The Army are increasingly aware that they cannot restore the security situation with out some new political deal. Above all, no one can any longer believe that a moderate Unionist Government could win the 1973 elections. 
4. The future prospect is therefore very bleak. In 1973 at the 
latest, if the Stormont system survives, a Craig-Paisley type Government will come to power in Northern Ireland. If that happens it will be because a majority of the electorate support Craig-Paisley policies; proportional representation would not alter this, even though it might produce a more representative opposition bench. No Westminster Government could live with a Craig or a Paisley as Prime Minister in Belfast. Direct rule will in consequence become unavoidable in 1973; and it may well do so sooner, since Faulkner could fall at any time and there is no moderate successor in sight.

5. If the Faulkner Government is the last hope for moderation it 
Stormont, the same seems likely to be true of the Lynch Government in Dublin as well. Lynch has been a disappointment to us recently. But like Faulkner his outlook is essentially moderate, by the overwrought standards of his environment. For this very reason his position in his own party is as precarious as faulkner’s. If he goes, his successor as Taoseich is bound to be much more extreme 
6. The attitudes of the Government and public opinion in the 
Irish Republic are likely to be crucial to any settlement in Northern Ireland. At present the IRA are operating in ideal guerilla conditions. They have a friendly frontier at their back, to provide sanctuary and supplies. They have the active support of a significant part of the Catholic population of the North, and the acquiescence of most of the remainder; Mao o uld call this a pretty good sea for the fish to swim in. But all this could change if a Dublin Government, with public support, were to take strong measures against the IRA within the Republic and to urge the Northern Catholics to cooperate with a new regime for Six Counties. 
7. These are the basic facts on which a new British policy will have 
to be based. It will also need to take due account of the following more general considerations: (a) The Catholic community in Northern Ireland is too large 
to be absorbed or ignored (as happened to the Protestants in the Republic after 1922) and too small to have any hope of ever forming the basis for an alternative government. It is believed in both communities that if there were no administrative discrimination against Catholics, and thus less Catholic emigration, the majority

Reference 1 - 50.00% Coverage
Page 1 : (0,0) - (598,787)
Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
(h) There are a number of ways in which tinkering with the 
constitution of Northern Ireland could produce a marginally better political apparatus, e.g. if the Senate were re-vamped or the electoral system for the Lower House improved. But there is no longer any hope that this sort of measure could alter the prospect of an extremist government, or direct rule to prevent it, by 1973 at latest. 
8. The policy options now open to the British Government fall naturally into three groups: (i) Those which involve maintaining the British connection with Northern Ireland unimpaired and undiluted; since Stormont seems doomed in 1973 if not before, this option in effect means some form of direct rule. 
(ii) Those which involve abandoning the British connection altogether; i.e. some form of withdrawal. 
(iii) Those which involve maintaining the British connection but in a modified form; in practice, what this would mean would be some form of deal with the Republic. 
9. 
The available policy options do not include: (1) Defeating the IRA and restoring law and order. In

itself this is a negative aim, however desirable; it has no positive content unless it masks a hopeless desire to return to the status quo ante. It is therefore not a policy. It may well not be an option either. 
(2) Establishing a coalition government in Belfast. This might well be possible in the context of (iii) above; 
see para 17 below. But short of that, there 
would be no way of ensuring Catholic participation nor of preventing the Protestants from abusing their majority status within the coalition. 
(3) Hoping for change following British and Irish entry into the EEC. In the long run, this may well help a lot. But over the next couple of years it could do no more at most than act as part excuse for any joint action by Westminster and Dublin which we might be able to develop under (iii) above. 
10. Direct rule could be forced on us, in 1973 or sooner, because 
the alternative was clearly an extremist Protestant Government in Stormont; or it could be imposed at a moment of our own choosing in the interval. The latter would be preferable, not just to secure the tactical initiative but also to avoid the appearance of acting to stifle the verdict of democracy. Suitably prepared direct rule would have much to commend it.

REFERENCE TO SUBSEQUENT AGGRAVATION OF SITUATION WAS A STATEMENT OF HISTORIC FACT, NOT OF CAUSE AND EFFECT. HE CLAIMED THAT ORIGINAL ITALIAN TEXT WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR 
- A POINT I FOUND HARD TO ACCEPT SINCE EVEN ENGLISH EDITION OF SEMI - OFFICIAL ’’ L’OSSERVATORE ROMAN" "FAILS TO BRING IT OUT. 
3. HE REGRETTED MISUNDERSTANDING BY ’’ TELEGRAPH’’, BUT SAID 
THAT THE POPE’S STATEMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN READ IN IRELAND IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WORDS OF CARDINAL CONWAY (WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN REPORTED TO ME) WHICH WOULD HAVE HELPED TO PUT EMPHASIS CORRECTLY ON POSITIVE PART OF MESSAGE. HE HAD NOT HEARD OF ANY ATTEMPT BY IRISH TERRORISTS TO CLAIM POPE’S STATEMENT HAD CRITICISED US SEMICOLON HAD I ? IF NOT, THIS WOULD CONFIRM THAT INTERPRETATION IN ’’ TELEGRAPH ’’ WAS UNJUSTIFIED. 
4. HE CONFIRMED THAT REPLY TO PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE COULD 
BE EXPECTED VERY SHORTLY, PROBABLY ON MONDAY. HE AGREED WITH MY SUGGESTION THAT IF WE WERE THINKING OF SENDING ANY FURTHER MESSAGE, WE SHOULD AWAIT THAT REPLY FIRST. HE CONFIRMED THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME, AS CHARGE, TO SEEK TO DELIVER ANY FURTHER MESSAGE PERSONALLY TO HIS HOLINESS.

A WAY FORWARD 
42. It is in fields such as these that progress towards real and effective participation in government and administration can be made. But before the Government can make decisions on participation, there must be participation in decisions. There could be little hope of revised structures working, if responsible parties are not willing oven to use existing structures to discuss such revision. The Government is at the table for discussion; it now places on that table these positive ideas, suggestions and views, which it invites others to criticise if they with, improve if they cant but above all to discuss. At the end of the day the only workable answers to Northern Ireland’s current problems will be answers broadly acceptable to the widest range of Northern Ireland people, and to that extent involving compromise and mutual give-and-take. Abstention is not a policy; it is merely putting off th day when those Northern Ireland people who are determined to live together in peace will sit down to see what progress they can make towards a new and more acceptable basis of affairs. 
43. If on the basis of those or other ideas, a blue-print for action can be hammered out, that action can be taken as soon as peace is in sight 
As long as 
terrorism continues, changes in political structures will be irrelevent, for no basis of confidence between people and communities can exist. It is only when the the destroyers have boon squeezed out by united public pressure that the work of building - politically, socially, economically Can begin.

to take action to restrict the number of routes which are left open across the border. 
WHITFIELD: Wasn’t the success of the operation in the 
fifties due to the co-operation of Devalera and the Irish Government. In the south, they. interned a hundred extremists as well and patrolled their side of the border. Now there is no sign of co-operation from Jack Lynch’s government at the moment. 
CHALFONT: No, this is true. We did have a responsible 
approach by the government authorities at that time, insofar as the IRA was concerned, but unfortunately on this occasion, Mr. Lynch’s government seems to be going out of its way to facilitate the IRA on the one hand and then on the second hand to say that it condemns violence. I find both actions inconsistent with each other.

EXTRACT FROM "THE WORLD AT ONE" Bob Williams/Lord Chalfont on the Irish Border Incident. 
TRANSMISSION: 30th August, 1971. 
CHALFONT: operation. 
- No, I don’t think this is really a feasible military The sealing of the border would mean the deployment of large 
numbers of troops. There are something like 120 unapproved roads crossing the frontier and 300 miles of border which can be crossed, even where there are no roads. My own calculation is that it would need something like the equivalent of another ten battalions of infantry to make the operation successful. You see what we’re faced withhere is a border problem similar in scale to the border problem between East and Wst Germany in Europe, and in order to effectively to seal that border we’ve seen what the Russians have had to do, machine gun posts, mines, barbed wire - this is the kind of thing that we’re talking about when we talk of sealing the border, I don’t think. quite honestly it makes military sense. 
WILLIAMS: But Mr. Taylor obviously think it makes political 
sense certainly, but he’s drawn attention to the fact that at the moment there’s not enough personnel to do this. He suggests a third force be recruited, how do you react to that? 
CHALFONT: Well I’m not quite sure what he had in mind by a 
"third force", I imagine that he has in the back of his mind something like the resuscitation of the B Specials. Whatever he has in mind, I think the idea of a third force is a very dangerous one. We have the British Army which, as he pointed out quite rightly is used in what I believe are now called urban guerilla operations, that is to say internal security in the towns, and then we have the UDR. Now the point that he didn’t make about the UDR is that it already has an authorised strength of 6,000 which would make quite a useful border patrol force, but there are only 4,000 recruits in it at the moment, so all we need first of all is to recruit that force up to strength and then I think there’ll be no need to start talking about a third force which would be military and politically very dangerous. 
WILLIAMS: Well in view of the intimidation going on against 
people joining..some people joining the UDR, and given the situation on the borders, surely something must be done to stop these kind of incidents, to stop the IRA coming across. 
CHALFONT: 
One of the things I think that ought to be done, and I know that the military have this in mind, is that there ought to be some way of signifying roughly where the border is. 
Yes, I think something ought to be done. You can paint trees, fences, you can make.. 
you can give a general idea along the whole length of the border as to where roughly the border is, you then make it quite clear to your own troops that they mustn’t cross that line, and you make it quite clear to any terrorists on the other side that if they do so it will be at their own risk. 
WILLIAMS: Eire Government is being irresponsible over the border issue at the moment? Do you accept what John Taylor implies that the

CHALFONT: Well I think it would be irresponsible of me to 
make any firm comment on that at the moment, all I would like to say is it is of course the responsibility of the Eire Government to ensure that illegal terrorist operations don’t take place on their territory and I think this incident at Corfmaglen 
is a very very rum one indeed. WILLIAMS: CHALFONT: What about the other odd fact that there were also 
a patrol of Mre soldiers there who appeared to stand by and do: absolutely nothing? 
Well again it does seem to me to have been a very 
unfortunate incident and one which it will be, I think, incumbent upon the Eire Government to look into very very closely indeed, otherwise I think one might have a certain amount of sympathy for what Mr. Taylor has said. 
WILLAMS: CHALFONT: Lett me press you on this, there were soldiers there, 
they apparently did nothing. Now on the face of it this appears to be a breach of international law. 
If this is actually so, I think one has got to 
wait while this incident is fully investigated, and also I think it would be irresponsible to comment until the United Kingdom Government, Stormont and the Government of Eire, have had a chance to discuss these matters together. But if terrorist activiti against British troops was taking place on the territory of Eire and the legitimate armed forces of the Eire Government did nothing to stop it, then it is prima facie a breach of international law.

report had been written essentially for peace-time conditions rather than for a situation of armed conflict such as obtained at present. LORD CARRINGTON agreed that this was the right view to take of the Hunt recommendations; he commented that he had certainly seen no policemen who were not armed when he visited Londonderry the previous day. 
2. The CLF explained that there were broadly speaking 
three categories of police stations to be considered: those in which the RUC and the Army both made use of the accommodation, other large or medium sized stations, and the small stations with only three or four policemen. There were 151 police stations altogether; at present the Army was providing protection for 72 of them, but he regarded this as entirely a temporary arrangement which 
- except in the case of the shared stations - should be ended as soon as 
possible. 3. 
LORD CARRINGTON made a brief survey of the present 
security situation. He was satisfied that the introduction of internment had been a major step forward in bringing the poison of terrorism to the surface; the task for the Security Forces was now one of cleaning up, which was bound to take quite a long time but which he was sure could be completed successfully provided that the political situation remained reasonably stable. In particular, internment had increased the amount of available information about the IRA and the Army’s main task was now to follow up this intelligence so that terrorists were given no respite. At the same time there were very real difficulties in providing sufficient Army manpower for this task 
- and it was really out of the 
question therefore to saddle the Army with widespread commitments to provide static guards as well. As for the UDR, he was reluctant to use its members on guarding police stations 
- partly because, so far at least, its strength was 
barely adequate for its other guard duties, but mainly because the idea that protecting police stations would be one of the regiment’s main tasks seemed likely to discourage would-be recruits. 
4. Members of the Police Authority then made the following 
points : a. 
They were strongly opposed to making the RUC responsible for guarding its own stations because this would aggravate the shortage of policemen available for proper police duties. The task of providing adequate protection at all police stations would call for something like 1,000 men. The force was already below strength by

D/Min/RB/5 Pt 9 September, 1971 You wrote to Robert Andrew on 26th August asking whether 
more effective action could be taken by the security forces to deal with explosions. We delayed a reply because Lord Balniel intended to speak to the Prime Minister on 5th September about this, but in the event the topic was not raised. However, since then I understand that the CGS has explained the position to the Prime Minister. You have asked for a reply to keep on the record. 
Robert Andrew’s letter to you of 18th May set out various 
measures being taken to counter the use of explosives. Amongst these was the intention to set up explosive detection teams to attempt to trace the sources of the explosives used. These have been fully operational since June. 
We have discussed with Northern Ireland whether any further 
measures can be taken. The Army is stepping up its surveillance of vulnerable points with the specific object of trying to catch those responsible for placing bombs or explosives, even if the resulting explosions cannot be prevented. But of course the key to prevention is in good intelligence of the whereabouts of the terrorists’ illegal stocks of explosives and their intended targets; and in proper controls over distribution of legally held explosives. 
RUC Special Branch intelligence sources reduced considerably 
immediately after Internment was announced on 9th August, but have since improved again, and we hope we shall eventually get a lead to the prime sources of the explosives 
- and the bombers 
by interrogation. We are also working on the feasibility of arranging for all 
detonators manufactured in the UK in future to be marked indelibly with a concealed coding which would enable the source of any found in unexploded bombs to be traced. However, there 
are a number of difficulties in the way of a practicable scheme, and it would inevitably take some time before marked detonators began to find their way into the hands of the terrorists. There have been references to the possibility of this kind of approach in the press; but we are keen not to show our hands publicly before we are ready,both because of the practical difficulties and because of the risk that terrorists would be put on their guard and would lay in a stock of unmarked 
- detonators.

ultimate choice between letting Ulster go or introducing direct rule. And both Mr. Lynch and Mr. Faulkner should realise this, at least by implication. 5. 
But so should the Cabinet. Either of these courses is an 
appalling prospect; and the former would be an act of such abdication that the Cabinet would presumably contemplate it only in the last resort. If so, however, they must be ready to contemplate direct rule as a real, and perhaps an imminent, possibility. 
It is tempting to wonder whether 
we might avoid it by withdrawing the law and order function from Stormont and leaving the Northern Ireland Government with merely their powers to administer agriculture, the social services and so forth. 
In theory, this 
would mean treating Northern Ireland no worse than Scotland and Wales; it would leave intact the constitutional structure created by the 1920 Act; and it should therefore be one degree less offensive to Unionist sentiment than direct rule. 
But, quite apart from the formidable practical difficulty 
of enforcing law and order from Westminster, this course might well lead to the fall of Mr. Faulkner’s Government; and it would be liable, therefore, to become, sooner or later, indistinguishable in practical terms from direct rule. 
The Cabinet should not be encouraged to think that it is an easy or 
realistic alternative to direct rule. 6. 
direct rule or something approximating to it 
They will realise, of course, that this extreme course - whether overt - would create considerable 
administrative and security problems. But they must also realise that it would create an even more serious political problem. 
Unless the Cabinet 
were prepared to face the indefinite continuance of direct rule or to withdraw the law and order function permanently from Stormont, it would be necessary at a very early stage to be seen to be trying to find some new political solution, whether this was a fresh attempt to reconstitute a Stormont Government on the 1920 model (i. e. including the law and order function, but with greater participation by the minority) or whether it took the form of some arrangement wholly different from the 1920 settlement. The Cabinet should be under no illusions that the introduction of direct rule would be unwelcome to the extremists at both ends of the spectrum. On the contrary, it is precisely what both of them want and are trying to compel us to give them 
- if only because it would enable them, in their pursuit of their 
respective political objectives, to resort to outright violence with politically clear consciences. For the IRA, in particular, it would be a positive bonus

I HAVE REFRESHED MY MEMORY ON THE PAPERS RELATING TO 
MAJOR CHICHESTER-CLARK’S RESIGNATION LAST MARCH TO ASSESS E VALIDITY OF THE ASSERTIONS MADE YESTERDAY BY ROBIN CHICHESTER-CLARK. 
HE MADE TWO KEY ASSERTIONS: 
BE (IE) LORD MOYOLA) RESIGNED BECAUSE HE WANTED SPECIFIC SWIFT ACTION TAKEN AGAINST THE IRA BEFORE THEY GAINED IN NUMBERS AND STRENGTH TO TERRORISE AND PARALYSE THE COMMUNITY. HIS REQUIREMENTS WERE THOUGHT TOO. DIFFICULT MILITARILY LAST 
MARCH. 
WAS NO DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR EFFECT IVE ACTION AGAINST THE IRA. 
NEITHER OF THESE TwO STATEMENTS IS CORRECT. THERE THERE WAS ALSO AGREEMENT ON CERTAIN Of 
THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES WHICH LORD MOYOLA WANTED E.G. ACTIVE PURUSIT AND HARRASSMENT OF THE TERRORISTS AND MORE CORDONING. BUT ONE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL, THE STATIONING OF TROOPS IN CATHOLIC ENCLAVES WAS REJECTED. 
THIS WAS NOT BECAUSE IT 
WAS ’’MILITARILY DIFFICULT’’ BUT BECAUSE IT WAS MILITARILY UNSOUND, IN THAT TYING DOWN TROOPS IN STATIC AND VERY POSITIONS, WOULD REDUCE RATHR THAN INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EFFORT AGAINST THE IRA. IT 
IT WAS ALSO THOUGHT THAT WO 
WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON COMMUNITY HARMONY, WHI" IN TURN REACT ADVERSELY ON THE SECURITY SITUATION 
LORD MOYOLA UNDERSTOOD THIS PERFECTLY WELL. HE ACCENTED THAT THE STATIONING OF TROOPS IN CATHOLIC AREAS WOULD BE MILITARILY UNSOUND BUT PERISSTED UP TO AND INCLUDING LORD CARRINGTON’S LAST MEETING WITH HIM ON 20 MARCH, IN ASKING FOR THIS TOBE DONE FOR POLITICAL REASONS. HE DID NOT HOWEVER MAKE THE ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PROPOSAL THE CONDITION FOR HIS CONTINUANCE IN OFFICE. RATHER HE GAVE US TO UNDERSTAND THAT HIS MAIN REASON FOR RESIGNING WAS THAT ME WAS 
HIM. 
EXHAUSTED AND THAT THE JOB HAD BECOME TOO DIFFICULT FOR HE IS RECORDED ON THE RECORD OF LORD CARRINGTON’S

DEFERRING HIS DECISION TO RESIGN PARTLY TO ENABLE HIM TO RECONSIDER THE TEXT OF HIS STATEMENT AND ALSO PARTLY BECAUSE OF YOUR A PARENT WILLINGNESS TO ’’HELP IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE’’. MINISTERS THREFORE AGREED THAT LORD CARRINGTON SHOULD GO TO NORTHERN

5 . WHEN ORD CARRINGTON MET MAJOR CHICHESTER-CLARK ON THE MORNING OF SUNDAY 20 MARCH THE ’ENCLAVE’ PROPOSAL WAS AGAIN REVIVED BY LORD MOYOLA AND THE GOC AGAIN EXPLAINED WHY IT WAS MILITARILY UNSOUND. 
LORD MOYOLA MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE DID 
NOT RETRACT HIS EARLIER DECISION TO RESIGN BUT WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE A STATEMENT WHICH CONTAINED NO RECRIMINATIONS ABOUT THE SECURTY SITUATION. 
6. THE RES NATION STATEMENT. ISSUED ON THE EVENING OF 20 MARCH SAID: IT IS APPARENT THAT PUBLIC AND PARLIAMENTARY OPINION IN NORTHERN MEASURES WHI 
ELAND LOOKS TO THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT FOR CAN BRING THE CURRENT IRA CAMPAIGN SWIFTLY TO AN 
END. I HAVE EXPRESSED TO BRITISH MINISTERS THE FULL FORCE OF THIS OPINION AND HAVE PRESSED UPON THEM MY VIEW THAT SOME FURHTER INITIATIVE IS REQUIRED. WHILE THEY HAVE AGREED TO TAKE ANY FEASIBLE STE 
IRA IT REMAINS THE PROFESSIONAL MILITARY VIEW - 
PEN TO THEM TO INTENSIFY THE EFFORTS AGAINST THE AND ONE WHICH 
INDEED I HAVE OFTEN EXPRESSED MYSELF - THAT IT WOULD BE MISLEADING 
TO THE NORTH N IRELAND COMMUNITY TO SUGGEST THAT WE ARE FACED WITH ANYTHING BUT A LONG HAUL AND THAT SUCH INITIATIVES THAT CAN BE TAKEN RE UNLIKELY TO EFFECT A RADICAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE SITUATION IN HE SHORT TERM. THE NORTHERN IRELAND POPULATION MUST THEREFORE EXERCISE THE GREATEST PATIENCE AND RESTRAINT SO THAT ANY EFFORT MADE BY THE SECURITY FORCES CAN SUCCEED. 
’I HAVE REMAINED CONVICNED THAT THE POLICIES WE HAVE BEEN 
FOLLOWING, WHETHER IN THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC OR SECUIRTY FIELD, HAVE BEEN REALSTIC AND IF FULLY UNDERSTOOD WOULD OFFER THE BEST HOPE OF BRINGING NORHTERN IRELAND OUT OF ITS PRESENT DIFFICULTIES.’ 
IT SEEMS THEREFORE THAT THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAN BE MADE TO THE PRESS NON-ATTRIBUTABLY:

(C) THE ONLY SPECIFIC SUGGESTION WHICH EMERGED iN THOSE DISCUSSIONS WHICH WAS NOT PURSUED WAS THE PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH REDOUBTS IN THE CATHOLIC AREAS OF BELFAST AND LONDONDERRY. THIS WAS REJECTED AS BEING MILITARILY UNSOUND AND LORD MOYOLA ACCEPTED THE ADVICE THAT I WAS MILITARILY UNSOUND.

TO IMMEDIATE DUBLIN TELNO 236 OF 12 OCTOBER YOUR TELEGRAM NO 478: MR LYNCH’S MESSAGE. PLEASE CONVEY FOLLOWING REPLY FROM PRIME MINISTER TO MR LYNCH. BEGINS I HAVE RECEIVED YOUR MESSAGE OF 9 OCTOBER IN REPLY TO MY ACCOUNT 
OF MY FURTHER TALKS WITH MR. FAULKNER. I CAN WELL UNDERSTAND YOUR DISLIKE OF THE MEASURES WHICH WE FEEL OBLIGED TO TAKE TO SECURE A BETTER CONTROL OF THE PASSAGE OF MEN AND MATERIALS ACROSS THE BORDER FROM THE REPUBLIC TO NORTHERN IRELAND. 
I TOO DISLIKE BEING 
PUT IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO TAKE THESE MEASURES, FOR THEY WILL BE COSTLY IN MANPOWER AND, GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE FRONTIER, WILL BE ABLE TO RESTRICT RATHER THAN ENTIRELY TO PREVENT THE ILLEGAL PASSAGE OF TERRORISTS WITH THEIR GUNS AND EXPLOSIVES. THAT THEY GO ACROSS WITH IMPUNITY AT PRESENT IS SHOWN BY THE PUBLIC STATEMENT OF JOE CAHILL. THE RESTRICTION OF SUCH MEN AND THEIR MATERIAL WILL ASSIST THE SECURITY AUTHORITIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN REDUCING THE EFFECT OF THE VIOLENCE FOR WHICH MEN LIKE HIM ARE RESPONSIBLE. I CANNOT REFUSE MY APPROVAL FOR THE NECESSARY MEASURES. 
2. THE FACT IS THAT THE SITUATION DOES NOT PERMIT US TO WITHHOLD ANY EFFICTIVE MEASURES WHILE WAITING FOR PROGRESS ON THE POLITICAL FRONT. THE RATE OF SUCH PROGRESS IS NOT DEPENDENT ALONE ON US AND THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND. IF IT IS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE VIEWS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MINORITY, AS WE WISH IT TO DO, THEN THE LATTER MUST COME FORWARD AND TAKE PART IN THE DISCUSSIONS WHICH WE ARE ANXIOUS TO HOLD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. IT IS THEIR REFUSAL WHICH IS HOLDING THINGS UP. 
3. YOU MIDJUDGE BRIAN FAULKNER’S READINESS TO CONTINUE WITH THE ALREADY SUBSTANTIAL PROGRAMME OF REFORM. DURING OUR TALKS AT CHEQUERS HE TOLD YOU OF SOME OF THE MEASURES WHICH WERE IN HIS DRAFT GREEN PAPER. WE HAVE ENCOURAGED HIM TO DELAY PUBLICATION IN THE HOPE THAT HIS PROPOSALS WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IF FIRST DISCUSSED WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MINORITY. AS THE LATTER ARE STILL REFUSING THEIR COOPERATION, I DO NOT THINK THAT WE CAN RESTRAIN HIM ANY LONGER FROM PUBLISHING HIS PROPOSALS AND THESE /ARE

DRAFT MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE TAOISEACH IN REPLY TO HIS MESSAGE IN DUBLIN TELEGRAM No. 477 OF 9 OCTOBER 
I have received your message of 9 October in reply to my account of my further talks with Mr. 
Faulkner. I can 
well understand your dislike of the measures which we feel obliged to take to secure a better control of the passage of men and materials across the border from the Republic to Northern Ireland. I too dislike being put in the position of having to take these measures, for they will be costly in manpower and, given the nature of the frontier, will be able to restrict rather than entirely to prevent the illegal passage of terrorists with their guns and explosives. That they go across with impunity at present is shown by the public statement of Joe Cahill. The restriction of such men and the material will assist the security authorities in Northern Ireland in reducing the effect of the violence for which men like him are responsible. I cannot refuse my approval for the necessary measures. 2. 
The fact is that the situation does not permit us to 
withhold any effective measures while waiting for progress on the political front. The rate of such progress is not dependent alone on us and the Government of Northern Ireland. If it is to take account of the views of respresentatives of the Minority, as we wish it to do, then the latter must come forward and take part in the discussions which we are anxious to hold as quickly as possible. It is their refusal which is holding things up. 3. 
You misjudge Faulkner’s readiness to continue with 
the already substantial programme of reform. During our talks at Chequers he told you of some of the measures which were in his draft Green Paper. We have encouraged him to delay publication in the hope that his proposals would be more

THE PRIME MINISTER, welcoming Mr Faulkner, said that they had agreed at the last Chequers meeting on 28 September that they would meet again soon to review the whole Northern Ireland situation. It was now a convenient moment to take stock in the light of the tripartite meeting and of subsequent debates in Westminster and Stormont. It was necessary, not merely to exchange views, but to co-ordinate their policies in every field so that they presented a united front to public opinion and to the Opposition parties on both sides of the Irish Sea. They could no longer risk giving the impression of being borne along by events; the situation was now grave socially, economically and politically, end the British public was losing patience. The Westminster Government could not continue to support Stormont unless public opinion at home was behind it. Furthermore, the Government’s policies in other fields were being jeopardised. The situation was thus one of danger for both Governments. 
MR FAULKNER agreed that the situation was grave and needed urgent remedial action. The security, economic and political problems were intertwined, but he had no doubt that a solution of the security problem was the key to progress elsewhere. Furthermore, without an immediate breakthrough in dealing with the terrorists, the administration of government would shortly become impossible. This situation could not wait to be handled by gradual methods. Sir Alec Cairncross in his interim report on the economic plight of the Province, referred to the situation as "desperate". Independently, Permanent Secretaries in all the Northern Ireland Departments had in a review of the economic and social position indicated that a breakdown in government might occur in a matter of weeks. He would give the Prime Minister a copy of this report. These officials were also concerned that the security situation should be tackled at once as the first priority. He had made the same point to the Westminster MPs who had visited Northern Ireland. Progress in restoring order would re-establish confidence in the system of government. What was needed was an increase in the Army presence, an enlargement of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), an offensive by the troops against the terrorists in Belfast and Londonderry, and firmer action on the border.

it would do much to increase public confidence, and the morale of the security forces themselves; their achievements in this regard had been considerable, but they were dimmed by the absence of a swift and manifest outcome of their efforts. 
MR FUALKNER said that he had personally examined the police recommendations in all internment orders submitted to him. Orders had been made only in respect of people actively engaged in terrorism, and he had in fact refused to make orders in a few cases. The Advisory Committee had already held 4 meetings and had considered 16 cases; 32 more cases were pending and further meetings fixed to consider them. He was expecting the first batch of recommendations within the next few days. Internees were all given notice of their rights and were allowed legal advice in the preparation of their cases; but legal representation was not allowed at their appearance before the Committee, which was conducted in strict confidence with only the members of the Committee present, each of whom was provided with the relevant documents. He had already stated publicly that it would be most unusual for him not to accept a recommendation of the Advisory Committee. The test for an internee’s fitness for release was not so much his innocence of any association with terrorist organisations, but whether he could be set at large without danger to the community. Internment should properly be regarded not so much as an alternative to trial as an alternative to being shot in an act of terrorism. Long Kesh at present provided accommodation for 380 internees and would have to be extended to accommodate 640 by the end of January. It would be helpful if the Army could undertake the building work on the same basis as in the original construction, and he would discuss with the Home Secretary the possibility of securing volunteers for the prison service from England. As to the trial of those accused of criminal offences, he agreed that speedy justice was important. Delays arose not so much over offences tried summarily before the magistrates as over cases returned for trial by jury. He thought it would be advantageous if the establishment of special commissions of assize could be considered to deal speedily with offences involving security. This was a reserved matter and fell to the United Kingdom authorities. The courts had in fact dealt firmly with a large number of cases and he would supply details of these to assist public presentation in Great Britain.

THE SECURITY SITUATION a. 
Troop Reinforcements 
There was general agreement that the priorities for the employment of any further units sent to Northern Ireland were: first, an increased effort against terrorists in Belfast; second, the better control of the border; and third, a reassertion of control of all parts of Londonderry. A larger force in Belfast, by enabling battalion areas to be made smaller, could help to deter terrorists. More importantly, it would enable the process of arresting terrorists to be speeded up. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the Army could provide, though with difficulty, an additional 3 battalions with the prime objective of clearing the main trouble areas in Belfast, and secondly for the Border task. The Londonderry problem had lower priority, but the precise method of use of the forces should be left to the GOC. 
b. The Border 
It was agreed that, although the military results might not be great, the time had coma to put in hand a programme of cratering unapproved roads in suitable cases, of which there were 84, humping the 20 approved roads (possibly also reducing their number to ease control problems) And working out means of dealing with those unapproved roads which could not effectively be cratered. The first phase of this programme could be implemented in about two weeks, as soon as our intentions had been notified to the Government of the Irish Republic. Care should be taken to minimise the inconvenience to farmers living in the border areas, consistently with the effective execution of the programme. 
c. Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) 
THE PRIME MINISTER said that volunteers to meet the new target of a force of 10,000 men were now being dealt with at about 300 a week. 1,200 were awaiting acceptance. The vetting process had been cut to two weeks, but it was essential that an effective vetting system should be maintained since without one suspicions would grow in Britain that the former "B Specials" were being recreated; the bipartisan approach to the Northern Ireland problem would be undermined; public acceptance of the need to sustain the Northern Ireland Government would drastically diminish and the latter could find itself facing its security problems on its own. The same danger had to be taken into account in considering the Northern Ireland Government’s proposals for a purely regional component of the UDR. 
Files\\SKD_round1\\PREM 15 482\\IMG_6178_PREM_15_482 - § 2 references coded [ 100.00% Coverage]

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
In discussion it was suggested, nevertheless, that there might be some advantage in recruiting a static component of the UDR, perhaps consisting solely of older men, provided that this could be done without impeding the build-up of the rest of the force. Possibly the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence for the Army, to whom the Secretary of State had given special responsibility for UDR matters and who would shortly be visiting Northern Ireland, might discuss this possibility with Mr Faulkner. 
d. Guarding of Police Stations 
At present 72 police stations were guarded by the Army. Some 23 of these were jointly used by the Army and the police and these the Army would continue to guard. But it was wasteful to use troops on the static duty of guarding other police stations. Equally the use of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) itself for the duty would greatly deplete their available numbers. The obvious course was to use the RUC Reserve. This was, however, an unarmed body and there were indications that a proposal to arm its members, especially with automatic weapons, would produce threats of resignation from the minority representatives on the Police Authority. To use armed Reserve policemen simply for these guard duties, however, would not amount to reaming them in a politically objectionable sense, since the men concerned would not be on the streets and the arms would not leave the police stations. It was possible that if a British Minister were to explain the proposal to the Police Authority, emphasising that it was devoid of political overtones, their agreement might be obtained. If it became clear that the proposal could not be implemented without consequential resignations from the Police Authority, a decision would have to be taken on whether to assign the task to the static element of a two-tier UDR. The UDR solution would, however, produce problems of organisation, control and morale to all of which some preliminary thought should now be given. 
e. Vigilantes 
MR FAULKNER said that independent citizens’ defence groups had recently been formed in many (largely Protestant) areas in Belfast. Their purpose was to identify and exclude terrorists in places where the security forces could not guarantee protection. It was worth considering whether they could be employed as an "eyes and ears" force on a regular basis; and the GOC had suggested some loose form of official control including perhaps the appointment of an "inspector".

ANNEX TEXT OF AGREED STATEMENT ISSUED ON 7 OCTOBER 1971 
A meeting took place at 10 Downing Street today between Mr Heath, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Mr Faulkner, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. 
Mr Heath was accompanied by the Home Secretary, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Lord President of the Council, and the Secretary of State for Defence. The Chief of the General Staff and the General Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland, were also present. 
The Ministers discussed all aspects of the current situation in Northern Ireland. They decided that meetings between the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland governments should be held at regular and frequent intervals at both ministerial and official level in London or Belfast. 
The ministers reviewed the security situation. The United Kingdom Government have decided to raise the strength of the Army in Northern Ireland by three battalions. These extra forces will be at the tactical disposal of the GOC to be used as he thinks fit, but their arrival will enable him, among other things to strengthen control of the border and to follow up more rapidly the action against terrorists made possible by the increased flow of information which is coming into the Army’s hands. 
The ministers also discussed measures to give effect to the decision to increase the strength of the Ulster Defence Regiment and to develop the regiment’s organization to increase the number of units and sub-units and thereby enhance its local character. Mr Geoffrey Johnson Smith, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence for the Army has been assigned special responsibility, at ministerial level, for UDR affairs and particularly for recruitment. He will be visiting Northern Ireland next week to confer with the UDR Advisory Council and others concerned. 
On internment, Mr Faulkner said that he expected shortly to receive the first batch of recommendations of the advisory committee set up to consider the cases of interned persons.

Draft of a statement to be issued by No 10 after Mr Faulkner’s visit 
The British Government have decided to raise the strength of the 
Army in Northern Ireland by three battalions. These extra forces will be at the tactical disposal of the GOC to be used as he thinks fit, but their arrival will enable him, among other things, to strengthen control of the border and to follow up more rapidly the action against terrorists made possible by the increased flow of information which is coming into the Army’s hands. 2. 
By agreement with the Government of Northern Ireland the British 
Government have authorised the GOC to take immediate measures to block a number of border roads and to restrict the passage of vehicles on others. This will unavoidably result in some inconvenience to people living in the border areas but it is a necessary step in the campaign to prevent the movement of terrorists, arms and explosives. 3.

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland Ministers at the meeting tomorrow will have before them three main 
documents. A. 
The brief for the discussion with Mr. Faulkner on the following day (NIPMV(71) 1). 
B. A military appreciation by the Ministry of Defence (Mr. Stephens’ letter of 4th October to Mr. Armstrong). 
C. A political appreciation by the Homo Secretary. The military and political appreciations are complemented by an 
intelligence appreciation, which has been specially prepared by tho JIC on the basis of the latest information. 3. 
The problems discussed in these documents have to be considered 
against the background of Lord Carrington’s recent visit to Northern Ireland and the conclusions which he himself formed as a result. 
I think that these 
can be summarised as follows:(1) 
In principle internment has been a success. It has done what it was 
intended to do; and, although there may still be a long haul ahead, the chance of gradually bringing terrorism to an end are now reasonably good. (2) Direct rule would represent an even more appalling strain on our resources than we have hitherto been prepared to contemplate. (3) We must therefore redouble our efforts to ensure that Mr. Faulkner remains in power. 4. 
on these points; and Ministers may then wish to consider whether Lord Carrington’s diagnosis is consistent with, and confirmed by, the Home Secretary’s political appreciation (I think that.’ broadly, both appreciation will come to the same conclusion). 
You may like to begin the meeting by asking Lord Carrington to expan Ministers 
will then need to decide whether they endorse Lord Carrington’s conclusions, This will be a critical decision, since it will determine our policy for as far ahead as it is profitable to looks and its implications, both civil and military will need to be considered with care.

The civil implications of a decision to maintain Mr. Faulkner can 
perhaps be summarised by saying that we must press him to be as conc to the Opposition as he can be without alienating his own Protestant support. This concept is explored in more detail In the briefs in NIPMV(71) 1. The points which are particularly important are:(i) The reform programme (i.e. the content of the Green Paper, includin 
a "broadening" of the Stormont Government; and the timing of its publication) (ii) Internment, especially the need for speed in dealing with appeals; and 
the inapplicability of "special courts". (iii) The measures to deal with civil disobedience, especially the treatment of family allowances. (iv) The improvement in our public relations activities. (The record 
of Lord Carrington’s discussions in Belfast contains several interesting suggestions about means of identifying local opinion - in the person of local dignitaries etc. 
with the enlarged UDR). (v) The economic situation (which has been added to the agenda at 
Stormont’s request), in the light of the latest - disquieting - report from Sir Alec Cairncross. 6. 
The question of improving contact between London and Belfast is a 
rather separate issue; and it involves certain considerations about Ministeria appointments, etc., which you have it in mind to mention to the Home Secretary at some point. I would only add that most people feel that we ought not to put Mr. Faulkner himself in the position of being "summoned’ too often to London. There is some force in thin. 
But, personally. I take 
it with a grain of salt and I should not have thought that a meeting at, say, monthly intervals would be regarded as "down-grading" Mr. Faulkner’s status too much, provided that it was supplemented by other arrangements for closer and more regular contact at lower levels. This needs to be discussed with Mr. Howard Smith. 7. 
As regards the military implications of peeping Mr. Faulkner in 
power, we must clearly be prepared to intensify the drive against terrorism. The possibilities are discussed in the brief on Security Problems (Item 5 in NIP MV(71) 1) and in the military appreciation, which concludes by suggesting (paragraph 23) that there are only three realistic options, i.e. options which are open to us without placing an intolerable burden on our resources and compelling us to introduce military government.

NORTHERN IRELAND: A POLITICAL ASSESSMENT 
1. The key factor in the immediate future which will determine whether Mr Faulkner’s Government can survive is whether he will be able to retain the support of his colleagues. In recent weeks they have shown little willingness to commit themselves in public speeches on Government policies, though at the and of last month three members of the Government did spook out in support: Mr Taylor’s recent remarks about the security situation and a third force and his discourteous behaviour on the occasion of Lord Carrington’s visit suggest that he is preparing the way to withdraw from the Government. There are signs that Mr West also may defect; in a speech on 24 September he suggested that a division of opinion might arise from discussions on the consultative document on possible constitutional changes whose preparation Mr Faulkner had announced on 21 September. 2. The Government as a whole is very vulnerable to pressure from their backbenchers and their own constituency parties and the fear that they may not be re-elected or even r-adopted. These pressures largely derive from the day-to-day security situation. There is a widespread belief that HMG and the Army have decided on a "long haul" policy and that there is some other policy called "short haul" not much more precisely defined than "going after the gunmen". The Government is also deeply worried by the growth of vigilante groups in Protestant areas of Belfast, at present unarmed, but by their behaviour apparently subject to careful discipline and control. 
3. Mr Faulkner’s position will also be affected by the Debate which opens in Stormont this afternoon and by the meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council which is due to meet on 8 October. 4. Other factors likely to influence the fortunes of the Government are: (a) An acute shortage of water caused partly by an exceptionally dry spring and summer depleting tho reservoirs and partly by terrorist explosions which have damaged main water pipes.

We understand that a scheme for the severe rationing of water is likely to be announced in Northern Ireland on October 7. 
(b) The fragility of the electricity supply 
(c) The near bankruptcy of many firms in Northern Ireland and ominous signs in recent weeks that some major industrial concerns may have to close down. It is reported that a number of senior executives of British and foreign firms have sent their families home and if this followed by the withdrawal of the executives themselves some firms at least will have no alternative but to close down. Sir Alec Cairncross, who in leading the term investigating the problem of economic and social development in Northern Ireland, reported today that the economic indicators are now dangerously misleading since there has been a rapid deterioration in the last two months. 
5. The SDLP and to a lesser extent the Nationslist Party are adopting a position of increasing intransigence. The SDIP have rejected Mr Lynch as their spokesman though the Nationalist Party, have reaffirmed that they recognise his as the Prime Minister of All Ireland. The alternative assembly, due to meet in Londonderry today,has been postponed indefinitely because they were unable to hire the Guild Hall. The fact that no attempt was made to find another place in which to meet my indicate dissension within the Opposition. Mr Fitt has said privately, for hat it is worth, that he till try to kill the alternative assembly and will refuse to be its President or chairman if asked; but he has retreated to the safety of the Westminster Hospital and appears to have on his own admission little or no control over his Party. 6. Mr Paisley’s behaviour is puzzling. He has told the Home Secretary that he is deeply worried about the danger of Protestant back-lash though he continues to place himself at the head of the Protestant extremists. At

to act more firmly against the terrorists. 12. Short of a major and spectacular success in the security field which can hardly be expected in the short term, tho situation show every sign of drifting nearer to the collapse of the present Government and the prospect of an unacceptable Government with the consequences this would have for a decision about direct rule. Senior civil servants are showing increasing signs of strain and frustration and their attitudes are likely to become as significant as those of their Ministers.

4th October, 1971. In your letter to Robert Andrew of 30th September you 
conveyed the Prime Minister’s wish to see a full military appreciation of the security situation in Northern Ireland and its prospects. 
General Staff. 
I attach an appreciation prepared by the The CGS discussed this paper in draft with 
the Defence Secretary upon the latters’ return from Northern Ireland on Friday evening, and a number of points which had emerged from Lord Carrington’s visit to the Province have now been incorporated. 
Lord Carrington has not see this final 
version, as he is of course away in Cyprus at present, and I am therefore circulating it in his absence 
he did have a talk with the Prime Minister about Northern Ireland on Saturday. 
In putting forward this appreciation the CGS has drawn 
attention to two points which I think I should emphasise. First, the paper seeks to meet the Prime Minister’s wish for a full exploration of the scope for intensifying military action, at whatever inconvenience to the civilian population; but, in the circumstances which obtain in Northern Ireland,the likely penalty of many forms of intensification would of course be not simply inconvenience for the public but an increase in the outright alienation of a section of the community. 
At this 
point the political and military considerations become inseparable and any purely military discussion of the pros and cons must necessarily be incomplete. 
The history of previous 
campaigns against terrorists does however indicate that the isolation of the terrorist from the community, whether it is achieved by military or political means or both, is a sine qua non of success. 
The second point is that this appreciation has been 
compiled in haste, with little consultation possible with GOC Northern Ireland and none with the Chiefs of Staff. 
The 
implications of even a slight increase in the current force levels on our other defence commitments are far-reaching and the

MILITARY APPRECIATION OF THE SECURITY SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND AT 4th OCTOBER 1971 
BACKGROUND 1. The policy at present governing the operations of the security 
forces is one of maximum vigour in the elimination and apprehension of identifiable terrorists, tempered by a scrupulous care to avoid actions which are, or may be represented as being, indiscriminate as between the terrorists and the general body of the minority community, or deliberately discriminate between Protestants and Roman Catholics as such. 
It is so tempered in order not to hamper the development of 
political initiatives, within the existing constitutional structure of Northern Ireland, designed to bring representatives of the minority community into fuller participation in political life, to persuade the minority community that they are not "second class citizens", and thus to erode the support (or at least benevolent neutrality) which substantial sections of the minority community at present afford to the IRA. 
towards ending the terrorist campaign and permitting the resumption of normal political, social and economic life within the Province. 
AIM 2. This appreciation aims first to analyse the present security 
situation, to consider what additional military measures might be taken within the framework of the existing policy, and to set out their military implications; and secondly to consider what further military options would be available in the event of a political decision to give the ending of the terrorist campaign overriding priority over all other considerations, and to set out their military implications. 
THE PRESENT SECURITY SITUATION 
The character of the emergency in ULSTER has changed radically this year, and the tasks of the Security Forces with it. 
3. In addition to keeping warring factions apart and protecting life and property in 
the maintenance of peace and order, the Security Forces have had to contend since February 1971 with a mounting scale of IRA terrorism. The facts speak for themselves. 
incidents involving 230 lbs of explosive; in May, 45 incidents and 417 lbs; in August, 120 incidents and 1800 lbs; in September 175 incidents and 2200 lbs. killed. 
9 August, the Army lost 10 killed. 
the losses (including UDR) were 10 killed and 48 wounded. 4. 
Between February 1971 and the imposition of internment on Between 9 August - 9 September 
Today IRA tactics include a well coordinated bombing campaign; 
armed attacks on police stations, usually involving automatic fire and occasionally even rockets; indiscriminate shooting at individuals of the Security Forces either from snipers or by hit and run raids from cars; and cross border raids and ambushes by Active Service Units (ASUs) against customs posts and police stations. 
In addition, intimidation 
is rife throughout the Catholic population; no opportunity is lost to stir up intersectarian strife; a cunning and effective propaganda machine exploits the situation to the full; and kidnappings and assassinations have been planned. 
In short, the IRA has the 
initiative and is causing disruption out of all proportion to the relatively small numbers engaged. 
This is not to credit the IRA with any unusual skill; it is the normal pattern of urban guerrilla activity In January 1971 there were 36 bomb Before February 1971 not a soldier had been The success of such initiatives would be a major contribution

thirteen major units in the infantry role and two armoured reconnaissance regiments. 
To implement the present policy there are in Northern Ireland The current deployment of these units is 
seven battalions in 39 Brigade, three battalions in 8 Brigade, two battalions and the two armoured recce regiments in 19 Brigade, with one battalion in Province reserve (see map at Annex A).

8. intensity. 
Nevertheless the Army is operating at a very high level of We are providing basic security throughout the Province. 
In addition about one third of our forces are available, as opportunities arise, for offensive operations such as hot pursuit of terrorists, arms searches, border patrols, and road-blocks; but this proportion will inevitably be reduced if basic security deteriorates and we have, for example, to deploy substantial forces to deal with intersectarian disturbances. 
Our dilemma is that, the greater the 
forces the IRA compel us to devote to providing basic security for the people, the fewer we have available for active operations against them. 
The specific security measures now in hand to deal with 
current problems include: a. 
Against the bombing campaign - the development of 
anti-bomb techniques, analysing all incidents to date, concentrating our defensive measures in small areas where the IRA is expected to operate next, and pursuing and developing our bomb squad techniques. 
But to pursue these measures 
effectively we need more intelligence. b. 
rearming of the Police specifically for police station guards; and the expansion of the UDR. 
To meet the local clamour for protection - a limited The pressing aim has been to 
find a solution which allows the Regular Army to be employed not on static guards in penny packets but where it can best seek out and destroy the IRA. 
c. To harness local energies - an expansion of the UDR. 
The recruiting ceiling has been raised to 10,000; vetting procedures have been streamlined; the age limit raised for applicants with no previous experience; an eighth battalion authorised, and additional companies planned; and transfer from the TAVR facilitated.

there are ominous signs of some weakening there. There particularly and a tendency to rely too much on the Army. 
Its attitude is passive and its contribution to the security situation minimal. 
This does not apply at present to the Special Branch, but An urgent examination 
of ways and means to improve the effectiveness of the uniformed branch is necessary. 
Meanwhile the Army must continue to bear the brunt of 
the security burden until the RUC can play a more effective part, which may not be for some years. 
10. To summarise, therefore, the IRA, in common with all terrorist organisations, has the initiative and has the resources, partly in the North but primarily in the South of Ireland, to maintain it; while there are constraints, political, humane and military on the methods and resources which the Security Forces can employ to eradicate it. The aim of the IRA remains unchanged. 
There are differences in the 
long term aims between the "Officials" and the "Provisionals", but both are united in seeking both the end of Stormont and subsequently the incorporation of the six counties in a United Ireland. 
the present, support a terrorist campaign designed to provoke Protestant anger, to force direct rule and then to influence public 
opinion in the UK to abandon the struggle, although the Officials claim to be opposed to terrorist action against civilians. 
11. On the basis of a recent JIC assessment (1): a. 
The present prospect is that IRA activities will continue 
and possibly increase, especially as they consider that none of their "demands" have been met after the tripartite talks. This continuing violence will only serve to increase polarisation between Catholics and Protestants. 
b. In turn, Protestant feelings will mount against 
continuing IRA activities, possibly resulting in intersectarian trouble, though outright Protestant militant action will probably only emerge if they consider that the integrity of Northern Ireland is in danger. 
12. The Problem Areas. Londonderry and the Border. 
The principal problem areas are Belfast, In Belfast, shooting and explosions 
continue, although there has been a diminution of incidents within the last 10 days; but there is a general hardening of attitudes among both Protestants and Catholics, soldiers are liable to be shot at at any time and the danger of escalation in methods of violence is ever present. 
and Creggan have become almost closed areas. 
Londonderry is comparatively quiet, but the Bogside Since the Crossmaglen 
incident operations and patrolling on the border, which is to all intents and purposes completely open, have been intentionally unobtrusive. 
These areas are discussed in more detail below.

The influence of the One 
But it is 
desirable to reassert the full range of military and police activities throughout the city; and if there is an IRA/Blaney build-up in Londonderry with a bomb offensive into the city centre or the Protestant areas it may become imperative to go into the Bogside and root out the terrorists and the hooligans. 
The timing, political implications , and likely reaction to such an operation would have to 
be carefully judged; and a strong military presence would be required for a long time, possibly as many as five battalions on the ground for several months. 
15. Along the border, ambushes and raids are likely to increase and to demonstrate how easily the ASUs can use the Republic as a sanctuary. Our range of options for more effective border control within the current policy includes: 
a. b. c. d. Blocking, cratering, or humping roads. Making more effective use of an expanded UDR on 
Border patrols, eg: units or subunits specialising in Border control. 
Use of SAS on surveillance operations. More regular troops, particularly armoured recce units. 
16. To intensify operations simultaneously in all these problem areas would clearly demand a much higher force level for a period of several months at least, and would certainly entail the maintenance thereafter of a higher level than the high level we are at present maintaining. Whether or not the effect of these operations, except in calming Protestant pressures, would be worth the effort involved must be doubtful. 
attempting to isolate the terrorist from the population, the only policy which has ever been found in the past to be effective against a terrorist organisation. 
This is not to suggest that intensified 
activity in these areas is not appropriate and should not be undertaken selectively in the near future. 
17. If, however, it is decided to abandon the present policy and attempt to improve the situation by a large scale application of military measures, the following paragraphs consider what those measures might be and the military implications of implementing them. There would, of course, be political implications both national and international, which are not considered in this paper. 
The 
financial implications have not been examined at all. TOUGHER MILITARY MEASURES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS 
18. The measures intended to eliminate terrorism primarily by military means must be applied first to the three problem areas already identified in para 12. 
involve both an increase in force levels (para 21) and the application of much more severe tactics. 
These measures will inevitably Such tactics include: 
a. Less restriction on the use of non-lethal devices (eg: SPAD) 
They would inevitably harden Catholic and Southern Irish It would in general run counter to a policy of 
attitudes and rally them even more firmly behind the IRA, which itself would be more united.

COURSES OPEN 23. a. 
The options for future policy in very general terms are three: Option One. 
To maintain operations at low intensity 
in the hope of thus assisting progress in the political field. The danger of this option lies in mounting Protestant pressure which might find practical expression in the formation of a third force and which might make the imposition of Direct Rule inevitable. 
b. Option Two. To abandon all hope of political progress 
with the minority communities, and adopt a "tough policy", including most, if not all, of the measures listed in paras 18 and 19 above. 
c. Option Three. This option might have short-term 
benefits, but is unlikely to eliminate terrorism in the long term. 
To continue our present policy, but to 
remove those restraints on the operations GOC Northern Ireland wishes to carry out, which are motivated by a desire not to disturb the current "political initiatives". 
certainly include intensification of border operations, including humping and cratering of roads, and an operation in Londonderry. 
24. The advantages of Option One are that it costs less in military terms, and is less likely to provoke either the immediate rising of "the Catholic people in arms" or the longer-term evil of the complete alienation of the minority in the North and the Government in the South. 
The disadvantage is that it does nothing to appease extreme 
Unionist opinion and thus may fatally weaken Mr Faulkner’s position, thereby bringing nearer the unpalatable prospect of Direct Rule. 
25. The prospective advantage of Option Two is that some tangible 
military success may follow and that it will reduce Unionist pressure upon both Stormont and Westminster, thereby strengthening Mr Faulkner’s position and rendering the contingency of Direct Rule more remote. On the other hand, apart from the certain military penalty of an increased force requirement, the result could be a Pyrrhic victory within Ireland, within Great Britain and internationally. 
26. From this brief analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of 
Options One and Two, it would seem therefore that Option Three represents for the time being the best reconciliation of all the factors which have to be taken into account. 
This option would

In the grave situation which now exists it is 
more than ever important that the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland Governments should form a common view of the situation and work together by agreed means to the vital end of restoring peace and stability. This being the case our contacts at the very highest level must be close and regular. For this reason I will be going to London on Thursday for further discussions with Mr. Heath and his senior colleagues on every aspect of the current situation. In particular I will be able to discuss the security arrangements in the light of Lord Carrington’s visit last week and his report on such matters as border security, the accelerated recruitment of the U.D.R. and the necessary firm response to new developments in the terrorist campaign.

Compton Report Draft Statement by the Home Secretary 1. The Report of the Committee under the chairmanship of 
Sir Edmund Compton which I set up to inquire into allegations against the security forces of physical brutality in Northern Ireland arising out of events on 9th August is being published today and copies /will be available in the Vote Office at 4 p.m.] 2. 
The Government are grateful to the members of the Committee of 
Inquiry for the care and thoroughness with which they carried out their difficult task. 3.

report is published with an introduction by myself as Minister appointing that inquiry. 4.

I think the House on studying the Report will conclude that this I made it clear to the Committee on the day they were appointed 
that their terms of reference included complaints of physical brutality in respect of a small number of men arrested on 9th August who were interrogated in depth after a detention order had been made against them. The purpose of this interrogation was to obtain vital information about the terrorist forces and their stocks of arms and explosives. 
In 
these cases also the Committee found no evidence of physical brutality or of torture or of brain-washing.

(1) Were the interrogation techniques described in the Compton Report 
legal? (a) The Government have no authority to give a ruling on a point of 
law. In any case the incidents took place in Northern Ireland; and the operative law is the law of Northern Ireland. Any individual issue must therefore be settled in the Northern Ireland courts. 
(b) [If pressed]. All that the Inquiry found was a measure of ill-treatment 
incidental to but not during the actual process of interrogation. They found no brutality and no physical or mental injury. 
(2) (3) Who was responsible for authorising the interrogations? Were the methods approved by both Westminster and Northern Ireland Ministers? 
(a) In dealing with a terrorist campaign such as that in Northern Ireland intelligence is the key to successful operations; and the key to intelligence is information regarding the operations, dispositions and plans of the terrorists. Her Majesty’s Government accordingly undertook to assist the Government of Northern Ireland in arranging for the RUC to set up an interrogation centre. Advice was given, based upon the principles which have governed interrogation in the emergencies of this kind in which the United Kingdom has been involved under Governments of both Parties. These principles are described in the Government note quoted in paragraph 46 of the Compton Report. 
(b) Following the decision of the Northern Ireland Government, after consultation with Her Majesty’s Government, to exercise powers of detention and internment where necessary, the formal authority for the removal of certain individuals from the place specified in their detention orders to the interrogation centre was given by the Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs. Interrogation was authorised by the Northern Ireland Government with the knowledge and concurrence of Her Majesty’s Government. 
(c) The RUC were in charge of the interrogation centre. But Army personnel were present at the centre in an advisory capacity; and for practical purposes the interrogation was a joint operation.

(d) The general rules involved were approved in principle by Ministers 
of both Governments; but their detailed application was necessarily a matter for the judgment of those concerned locally. In the light of the Committee’s report the Government are inviting three Privy Counsellors to examine, and provide authoritative advice on, the procedures for the interrogation of persons suspected of involvement in a terrorist campaign, including their custody while subject to interrogation, and on the application of those procedures. 
(4) If the methods were illegal, what action is being taken against 
those responsible? (a) 
As indicated in paragraph 18 of the Home Secretary’s preface to the 
Compton Report, the Government do not regard the Committee’s findings as in any way reflecting adversely on the responsibility and discipline with which the security forces in Northern Ireland are conducting their fight against a vicious and ruthless enemy. So far as the military Forces for which Her Majesty’s Government are responsible are concerned, the report does not appear to indicate any circumstances in which disciplinary action would be appropriate.

1. A. 
Does the Government accept the Compton Report? The Government welcome the Committee’s findings that none of 
those who were arrested on 9 August were subject to physical brutality by the security forces, much less torture or brainwashing. The Government have taken note that in a relatively small number of cases the Committee concluded that some of those arrested suffered a measure of physical ill-treatment. 
Most of the cases in which the Committee considered some physical ill-treatment had occurred related to the process of 
interrogation, and in the light of the Committee’s report, the Government are inviting 3 Privy Counsellors to examine, and provide authoritative advice on,the procedures for the interrogation of persons suspected of involvement in a terrorist campaign, including their custody while subject to interrogation, and on the application of those procedures. I would however emphasise what the Hoe Secretary said in his preface to the Report about the difficulty of implementing the rules in detail in circumstances in which rigorous and intensive interrogation is vitally and urgently necessary. 
As for the handful of cases where the Compton Committee thought 
that people suffered ill-treatment at the time of arrest or at a Regional Holding Centre - for example, the case of Mr. Cummings who was hooded and bound as a military precaution -, I can only say that it speaks volumes for the discipline and common sense of the many soldiers who were engaged in this large-scale and dangerous operation in which a total of 342 arrests were made that there were so very few cases of this kind and that when they did occur, on no occasion, in the Committee’s view, was ill-treatment deliberate. 
2. 
Will any disciplinary action be taken in respect of any cases where Compton concluded there had been ill-treatment? Is the Secretary of State for Defence satisfied that this report exonerates the Army? 
A. As was indicated in paragraph 18 of the Home Secretary’s 
preface to the Compton Report, the Government do not regard the Committee’s findings as in any way reflecting adversely on the responsibility and discipline with which the security forces in Northern Ireland are conducting their fight against a vicious and ruthless enemy. So far as the military forces for which HMG are responsible are concerned the repo t does not appear to indicate any circumstances in which disciplinary action would be appropriate. 
It is worth pointing out that it was only in the case of 19 
persons out of a total of 342 arrested that the Compton Committee found any evidence of physical ill-treatment and that in 8 of those cases - 
/small 
those which were concerned ith the handling of suspects at the time of arrest and at Regional Holding Centres - such ill- 
treatment as there was could in no way be regarded as deliberate or as part of the routine for handling prisoners. These are remarkably

12. 
Who was responsible for authorizing the interrogations? Were the methods approved by both Westminster and Northern Ireland Ministers? 
A. In dealing with a terrorist campaign such as that in Northern 
Ireland intelligence is the key to successful operations; and the key to intelligence is information regarding the operations, dispositions and plans of the terrorists. Her Majesty’s Government accordingly undertook to assist the Government of Northern Ireland in arranging for the RUC to set up an interrogation centre. Advice was given, based upon the principles which have governed inter in the emergencies of this kind in which the United Kingdom has been involved under Governments of both Parties.

with the knowledge and concurrence of Her Majesty’s Government. 13. 
A. The general rules involved were approved Following the decision of the Northern Ireland Government, after Interrogation was authorised by the Northern Ireland Government, 
Did Ministers know precisely what methods of interrogation would be used? 
in principle by 
Ministers of both Governments; but their detailed application was necessarily a matter for the judgment of those immediately responsible For this reason Ministers could not know in precise detail what course interrogation would take, but we were fully confident that those responsible for carrying out the interrogation of suspects would observe the rules governing the conduct of interrogation 
- rules 
issued and later revised in the time of the previous Government. As the Home Secretary says in his introduction to the Compton Report, the Committee’s report brings out the difficulty of implementing the rules in detail in circumstances in which rigorous and intensive interrogation is vitally and urgently necessary.

results - 
which were issued in the time of the previous Administration and which the present Government have since endorsed, make absolutely clear that violence to life and person, cruel treatment, torture and outrages upon personal dignity are forbidden and that those interrogated are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline.

23. A. 
Are you now going to modify the interrogation rules? In the light of the Committee’s report the Government are 
inviting three Privy Counsellors to examine, and provide authoritative advice upon, the procedures for the interrogation of persons suspected of involvement in a terrorist campaign, including their custody while subject to interrogation, and the application of those procedures. 
This Committee will be able to take an independent and objective 
look at the existing procedures and recommend any changes in them which they think are necessary. 
24. A. 
Will the Privy Counsellors re-examine some of the allegations investigated by Compton? 
That is not the intention. The Privy Counsellors will be 
examining interrogation procedures and their application and providing authoritative advice on them: they will not be looking into allegations about the treatment of individuals. 
The Compton Committee were given information about interrogation 
procedures in the course of their inquiry into allegations of brutality: they were not asked to examine the procedures as such. 
25. 
How long are they expected to take before they report? It is not possible to estimate how long they would take.

Forces are known to have been killed; and many civilians and members of the Armed Forces have been injured, some seriously. There have been over 800 incidents involving explosives; and the weight of explosives used by the terrorists so far in 1971 has been calculated at about 10, 000 lbs. 
In 1971, up to the morning of 8 November, the 
security forces had uncovered 171 pistols and revolvers, 127 rifles, 12 machine guns, 68 shotguns, 67,646 rounds of ammunition, over one ton of explosives, 1,451 pipe, petrol and nail bombs, 117 grenades, 26 gallons of acid, and large quantities of fuses, detonators and electric cable. These figures refer only to arms found in Northern Ireland; they do not include, for example, the large quantity of arms recently discovered at Amsterdam. 5. 
The aims of the IRA are to intimidate the population by brutal 
terrorism and so to prevent any co-operation with the Government, the police and the courts of law; to inhibit normal political activity and constitutional progress; and to cause the public in Great Britain to become so sickened by the ceaseless bloodshed and destruction that the Army’s withdrawal will come to be seen as the lesser of two evils. No responsible Government can afford to yield to pressures of this kind. Introduction of Internment 6. 
The preservation of law and order in Northern Ireland is primarily 
the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Government. By July and early August the deterioration in the situation in Northern Ireland had reached the point where they felt it necessary, with the agreement of Her Majesty’s Government, to resort to their powers of internment. 7. 
In announcing the decision to introduce internment on 9 August 
1971 the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr Brian Faulkner, said:. "If Northern Ireland is to survive and prosper, two things are essential. We must sustain a continuing programme of economic and social development, and we must find the means to create a more united society here 
- one in which all men of goodwill, 
however divergent their legitimate political views, may participate to the full. 
our policy. These things are, and will continue to be, the aims of

"Neither will be possible in a climate of terrorism and violence. The outrages to which we have been subjected now threaten our economic life and create every day deeper divisions and antagonism within our community. These, indeed, are the clear objects of those who carry them out. "Every means has been tried to make terrorists amenable to the law. Nor have such methods been without success, because a substantial number of the most prominent leaders of the IRA are now serving ordinary prison sentences. 
But the terrorist 
campaign continues at an unacceptable level, and I have had to conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthless viciousness. "I have therefore decided, after weighing all the relevant considerations, including the views of the security authorities and after consultation with Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom last Thursday, to exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as Minister of Home Affairs". 
8. 337 men were arrested on Monday 9 August; and the arrests of 
others under the Special Powers Act have continued. 889 had been arrested by midday on 6 November, 
1971. In each case very careful 
consideration was given to the question whether an internment order was necessary. 
In the event 299 had been interned by 6 November and were 
being held at Long Kesh internment camp. 99 were being held under detention orders in Belfast Prison. 486 had been released and five were being held pending a decision on the making of detention orders. 9. 
Wherever possible, the normal processes of law are followed. 
Since 9 August 317 persons have been arrested and charged in the ordinary way with offences arising from civil disturbances. 10. 
An advisory committee under Regulation 12 of the Special Powers 
Act has been set up under the chairmanship of His Honour Judge Brown to review the cases of all those against whom internment orders are made. The members are Mr R W Berkeley and Mr P N Dalton. The rate of

In dealing with a terrorist campaign such as that in Northern Ireland,

Her Majesty’s Government accordingly acceded to a request from the Government of Northern Ireland to assist the RUC in setting up an interrogation centre.

These principles are described in the Government note quoted in paragraph 46 of the Compton Report.

14. In the present circumstances of Northern 
Treland, as described in paragraphs 3-5 of this note, it is imperative to obtain all available intelligence in order to save the lives of civilians and members of the security forces; and it is therefore essential to interrogate suspects who are believed to have essential information. The principles applied in the interrogation of suspects in Northern Treland since August this year, and the methods employed (which are necessary not only for reasons of control but also to protect the lives of those being interrogated against the risk of reprisals), are essentially the same as those which have been employed in all emergencies of this kind in which Britain has been involved in recent years. 
The rules 
now in force were issued in 1965 and were revised in 1967 in the light of recommendations made by Mr. Roderick Bowen QC in a report on the procedures for the arrest, interrogation and detention of suspected terrorists in Aden (Cmnd 3165). 15. 
These rules are summarised in the Government’s 
evidence to the committee (paragraph 46) which also points out that: 
"The precise application of these general rules in particular circumstances is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the part of those immediately

responsible for the operations in question. Intelligence is the key to successful operations against terrorists, and the key to intelligence is information regarding their operations, their dispositions and their plans. When combating a terrorist campaign, time is of the essence; information must be sought while it is still fresh so that it may be used as quickly as possible to effect the capture of persons, arms and explosives, and thereby save the lives of members of the security forces and of the civil population." 
Action by the Government 16. 
The Government reject any suggestion that the 
methods currently authorised for interrogation contain any element of cruelty or brutality. 
The report 
of the Committee confirms this view. But it also brings out the difficulty of implementing the rules in detail in circumstances in which rigorous and intensive interrogation is vitally and urgently necessary. The Government have therefore decided that it would be right to set up machinery for examining and providing authoritative advice upon the procedures for the interrogation of persons suspected of involvement in a terrorist campaign, including their custody while

PRISONER HANDLING IN INTERROGATION CENTRES NORTHERN IRELAND REPORT BY THE INTELLIGENCE CO-ORDINATOR 
Minutes of the Meeting of Ministers (GEN.47(71)6th Meeting 
18 October) instructed the Intelligence Co-ordinator "in consultation with officials of the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Services, to make an immediate assessment of the methods of interrogation suitable for use in Northern Ireland." In accordance with the above instructions the Intelligence 
Co-ordinator recommends as follows:1. 
That the handling of detainees and their subsequent 
interrogation in Northern Ireland should continue to be governed by the general principles laid down in JIC(65)15 and amendment dated 10 February 1967. 
[Annexes A and B respectively.] 2. The responsibility for all prisoner handling and 
interrogation methods employed at the special interrogation centre should rest with a senior police supervising officer. The role of military officers attached to the centre should be purely advisory. 3. 
There should be substantial evidence of a detainee’s 
involvement in terrorist activities before he is selected for protracted interrogation at the special interrogation centre.

c. The following are prohibited: 
(i) Violence to life and person, in particular, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture. 
(ii) Outrages upon personal dignity, in 
particular humiliating and degrading treatment. 
d. Subjects are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline. 
(These rules follow the broad principles for the treatment of persons under arrest or detention during civil disturbances as laid down in Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949)). 
3. The precise application of these general rules in particular 
circumstances is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the part of those immediately responsible for the operations in question. Intelligence is the key to successful operations against terrorists; and the key to intelligence is information regarding their operations, their dispositions, and their plans. When combating 
a terrorist campaign time is of the essence; information must be sought while it is still fresh so that it may be used as quickly as possible to effect the capture of persons, arms and explosives and thereby save the lives of members of the security forces and of the civil population. 
4. Information can be obtained more rapidly if the person being 
interrogated is subjected to strict discipline and isolation, with a restricted diet; but violence or humiliating treatment, as explained above, are forbidden. Equally any person undergoing interrogation must be assured of security against either violent treatment by his fellow detainees or recognition by them; the evidence of IRA vengeance against informers underlines the importance of this safeguard." 
47. The evidence we received from the officials we interviewed about the 
application of the general rules set out in the Government memorandum we reproduce above can be summarised as follows. The objectives mentioned in the memorandum may involve the use of the following methods, the circumstances and duration of whose application may vary according to the staff and accommodation available at the interrogation centre and the length of time for which detainees may be left alone or must be kept together:-

1. The general rules governing the custody of detainees and the 
processes of interrogation have been reviewed from time to time by the Government Departments and agencies concerned in the light of experience gained in the various internal security operations in which HMG have been involved since the last war. The techniques of interrogation currently in use have also been employed in manY Previous internal security situations. The latest instructions on the rules to be followed were issued in 1965, and were revised in 1967 to provide for the daily inspection by a medical officer in the light of the recommendations in the Report on the Aden situation by Mr Roderic Bowen Q.C. issued in November 1966 (Cmd 3165). 2. 
These general rules include the following safeguards: a. 
b. c. Subjects to be seen daily by a Medical Officer. 
The following are prohibited: (i) 
Violence to life and person, in particular, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture. 
(ii) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment. 
d. 
Subjects are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline. 
(These rules follow the broad principles for the treatment of persons under arrest or detention during civil disturbances as laid down in Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative 
to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949)). 3. The precise application of these general rules in particular 
circumstances is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the part of those immediately responsible for the operations in question. Intelligence is the key to successful operations against

Wall Standing Requiring detainees to stand with their arms against a wall but not in a position of stress provides security for detainees and guards against physical violence during the reception and search period and whenever detainees are together outside their own rooms in a holding room awaiting interrogation. It also assists the interrogation process by imposing discipline. 
Although the security need for this technique could be reduced by an increase

The Sunday Times allegations are covered by the terms of reference of 
Sir Edmund Compton’s inquiry; indeed, the terms of reference were specially framed for this purpose. (See letter of 31st August to Sir Edmund Compton of which Mr. Wilson can, if necessary, be given a copy). 
They read as follows:- 
"To investigate allegations by those arrested on 9th August under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 of physical brutality while in the custody of the security forces prior to either their subsequent release, the preferring of a criminal charge or their being lodged in a place specified in a detention order". Allegations of the kind quoted in the Sunday Times have been brought to 
the notice of the Compton Inquiry, who have already carried out an investigation and will include the results in their forthcoming report. Six weeks ago the Inquiry asked the Sunday Times and other newspapers to furnish them with any evidence in their possession. They have accordingly taken note of the offer by the Editor of the Sunday Times, which has now, at last, been made, to furnish them with the full material on which yesterday’s report was based. As soon as this material is supplied to them, they will extend their Inquiry to deal with any matters which were not covered by the investigations which they have already made. If so, however, their report (which might otherwise be available early in November) may be a little delayed. When the report is available, it will be published, subject to whatever 
amendment or omission is required for security reasons. At that stage the Government would be prepared to inform the Leader of the Opposition, on the normal Privy Counsellor basis, of the amendments or omissions which had been made. 
Until the report is published the whole matter is, in a sense, sub 
judice; and it would therefore be both premature and improper for the Government to comment publicly on allegations which have appeared in the Press. But they are prepared to tell Mr. Wilson - again, on a Privy Counsellor basis - that the methods of interrogation which Ministers authorised in Northern Ireland are the same in principle as those which were employed in similar circumstances of organised terrorism 
- e. g. in Malaysia, Cyprus and 
Aden - and were last reviewed in 1967 in the light of the Bowen report on the Aden episode. As in all cases of this kind, it is naturally impossible to be sure that in the heat of the moment there may not have been some over severity in applying some of these accepted techniques in Northern Ireland. For further enlightenment on this point, we shall have to await the Compton report. But it is necessary to bear constantly in mind the overriding need

to sustain law and order in Northern Ireland and to protect both British troops and innocent civilians against ruthless and unscrupulous terrorism. For this purpose prompt intelligence is indispensable; and it would be unfair (to put it no more strongly) to our own Forces to forgo any permissible means of securing such intelligence.

NORTHERN IRELAND Background for Briefing The British Government deliberately did not react 
to Mr. Lynch’s first statement demanding that "Stormont must go", in the hope of not increasing tension in Northern Ireland 
still further inflaming the position 
in the South. But it was impossible for the Government not to react to the telegram which Mr. Lynch sent to the Prime Minister yesterday, with its reference to the encouragement of passive resistance, particularly in relation to its timing, when the Prime Minister and Mr. Faulkner were holding a meeting the whole purpose of which was to look forward to the possibilities or reducing tension and improving community relations in Northern Ireland, once the security situation had become more normal. 
The tone of the message was particularly regrettable 
when Mr. Lynch knew that the meeting which had already been arranged could be brought forward if he wanted it to be: he only had to ask. At the meeting with Mr. Faulkner, Ministers covered 
the whole ground. They discussed arrangements for dealing with the terrorists. They discussed the allegations of brutality by the Armed Forces. It was made clear that arrangements for participation by the Opposition which had been offered by Mr. Faulkner still stood. Ministers discussed how the communities could be brought to live together more amicably and how participation of the minority could be a full and guaranteed reality when the security situation became more normal.

CAMPAIGN OF TERROR AND MURDER. LORD PARKER, A FORMER LORD CHIEF JUSTICE, HAS ACCEPTED THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF A COMMITTEE TO UNDERTAKE THIS TASK. MY REASON FOR HOPING THAT THESE PROBLEMS WILL NOT BE BROUGHT 
BEFORE THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION RELATES RATHER TO THE DANGER THAT MY GOVERNMENT AND YOURS WOULD THERE BE RANGED ON OPPOSITE SIDES IN A PUBLIC FORUM ON ISSUES WHICH, STARTING FROM PARTICULAR ALLEGATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS WOULD BE LIABLE TO BROADEN OUT INTO CHARGES AND COUNTER-CHARGES CONCERNING THE OPERATIONS OF THE IRA, THE ROLE THEY HAVE IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE SUPPORT THEY RECEIVE IN THE REPUBLIC, WHICH COULD HARDLY FAIL TO RESULT IN ACRIMONIOUS EXCHANGES BETWEEN OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS. THIS WOULD TO MY MIND BE UNFORTUNATE GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND PROBLEM AND THE NEED FOR OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS TO REMAIN IN THE CLOSEST AND FRIENDLIEST TOUCH ABOUT IT. THIS WILL BE PARTICULARLY NECESSARY IF THE SECURITY SITUATION IN THE NORTH DEVELOPS SUFFICIENTLY FAVOURABLY FOR AN EARLY IMPETUS TO BE GIVEN TO POLITICAL MOVES. AS YOU KNOW OUR AIM IS STILL TO DISCUSS THE WAY FORWARD WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE COMMUNITIES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO FINDING A WAY TO GIVE THE MINORITY THERE AN ACTIVE, PERMINENT AND GUARANTEED ROLE IN THE LIFE AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS OF NORTHERN IRELAND. AS WE ARE MAKING CLEAR IN THE DEBATE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, THE BEST METHOD AND TIMING FOR DOING THIS IS VERY MUCH IN THE FOREFRONT OF OUR MINDS. IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS THAT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT FEEL CONSTRAINED TO GIVE WAY TO PRESSURES TO TAKE A PUBLIC STANCE AGAINST US AT STRASBOURG. IF YOU DO, IT WILL NO DOUBT REJOICE THE HEARTS OF MANY PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLIC AND SOME OF THOSE AMONG THE MINORITY IN THE NORTH. IT WILL HOWEVER ALSO PLEASE THOSE PROTESTANT EXTREMISTS WHO ARE ALWAYS MOST OPPOSED TO THE MAINTENANCE OF A REASONED DIALOGUE BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BETWEEN OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS. THIS SEEMS TO ME ESSENTIALLY A TIME IN WHICH ALL THOSE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE IN PROGRESS THROUGH VIOLENCE SHOULD PUT ASIDE CHARGES AND COUNTER-CHARGES, AND INDEED KEEP ON ONE SIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES OVER ULTIMATE AIMS, HOWEVER LEGITIMATE IT MAY BE TO PURSUE THESE IN DUE COURSE THROUGH DIPLOMATIC AND CONSITITUTIONAL MEANS, AND CONCENTRATE ON THE IMMEDIATE TASK OF MAKING NORTHERN IRELAND ONCE AGAIN A PLACE IN WHICH ALL ITS PEOPLE, WHATEVER THEIR RELIGION OR POLITICAL VIEWS, CAN WORK TOGETHER IN PEACE AND PROSPERITY. THIS IS CERTAINLY OUR AIM AND I FEEL SURE I CAN COUNT ON YOUR SUPPORT IN WORKING FOR IT.

The 
report which was made after very thorough investigation but virtually without the cooperation of those about whom the allegations had been made, showed that in regard to the initial arests there were very few complaints and those that there were had in the Committee’s view very little substance. No force but the minimum had been used to achieve arrest and there was no evidence whatever of deliberate brutality on the part of any of the armed forces involved. With regard to the allegations about the methods used during interrogation, the Committee’s findings were that there was no evidence of physical brutality, still less of torture or brainwashing, but that there had been physical ill-treatment which raised questions about the methods used in interrogation. In the light of these last findings, the Government considered that it would be right to set up a body to review the principles governing the methods of interrogation used, in view of the very difficult sues that arise where the security forces are engaged against a ruthless and deliberate campaign of terror and murder. Lord Parker, a former Lord Chief Justice, has accepted the chairmanship of a Committee to undertake this task. 
My reason for hoping that these problems 
will not be brought before the European Commission relates rather to the danger that my Government and yours would there be ranged on opposite sides in a public forum on rues which, starting from particular allegations and explanations would be liable to broaden out into charges and countercharges concerning the operations 
the IRA, the 
role they have in Northern Ireland/the support they receive in the Republic 
could hardly 
fail to result in acrimonious exchanges between our two governments. This would to my mind be

unfortunate given the complexity of the Northern Ireland problem and the need for our two governments to remain in the closest end friendliest touch about it. This will be particularly necessary if 
the security 
situation in the North develops sufficiently favourably for an impetus to be given to political moves. As you know our aim is still to 
discuss the way forward with representatives of all the communities. We are committed to finding a way to give the Minority there an active, permanent and guaranteed role in the life and public affairs of Northern Ireland. As we are making clear in the debate in the House of Commons, the best method and timing for doing this is very much in the forefront of our minds. It is because of these considerations that I hope that you will not feel constrained to give way to pressures to take a public stance against us at Strasbourg. If you do, it will no doubt rejoice the hearts of many people in the Republic and some of those among the Minority in the North. It will however also please those Protestant extremists who are always most opposed to the maintenance of a reasoned dialogue both public and private between our two Governments. This seems to me essentially a time in 
which all those who do not believe in progress through violence should put aside charges and counter-charges; 
indeed keep on one side their 
differences over ultimate aims, however legitimate it may be to pursue these in due course through diplomatic and constitutional means and concentrate on the immediate task of making Northern Ireland once again a place in which all its people, whatever their religion or political views, can work together in peace and prosperity. This is certainly our aim and I feel sure I can count on your support in working for it

BRITISH POLICY IN NORTHERN IRELAND (Note by the Central Policy Review staff) 
In 1969 and 1970 successive British Governments had a well-defined policy on Northern Ireland. Its prospects of success were promising; its assumptions were reasonable; it commanded bipartisan respect at Westminster; and it was supported by the moderate en at the head of the Governments in Belfast and Dublin. Through no fault of our own, that policy has failed. It is important to be absolutely clear about what we were trying to achieve; about the completeness of our failure; and about our need for a new policy if we are not simply to flounder. 
2. The 1969-70 policy arose from the Stormont Government’s failure 
to maintain order with its own resources. It had to call in the British Army. The Westminster Government demanded a major concession in return. That concession was the Reform Programme, designed to remove the basis for Catholic grievances. It was recognised that this Program would be unpopular with the Protestant majority which had elected the Unionist Government at Stormont. But in 1969 the next Stormont elections were still four years away. In the interval it was hoped that there would be time for the Programme to take effect; for the Catholic community to be reconciled to Unionist rule; and for the Protestant community to discover that Reform could bring peace without endangering their way of life. It would then be possible for the moderate Unionists, lead by e.g. Chichester Clark or Faulkner, to win the 1973 elections and to defeat any extremist Protestant challenge led by e.g. Craig or Paisley. 
3. One element in this policy has worked out well. Contrary to some

5. If the Faulkner Government is the last hope for moderation at 
Stormont, the same seems likely to be true of the Lynch Government in Dublin as well. Lynch has been a disappointment to us recently. But like Faulkner his outlook is essentially moderate, by the overwrought standards of his environment. For this very reason his position in his own party is as precarious as Faulkner’s. If he goes, his successor as Taosech is bound to be much more extreme. 
6. The attitudes of the Government and public opinion in the 
Irish Republic are likely to be crucial to any settlement in Northern Ireland. At present the IRA are operating in ideal guerilla conditions. They have a friendly frontier at their back, to provide sanctuary and supplies. They have the active support of a significant part of the Catholic population of the North, and the acquiescence of most of the remainder; Mao would call this a pretty good sea for the fish to swim in. But all this could change if a Dublin Government, with public support, were to take strong measures against the IRA within the Republic and to urge the Northern Catholics to cooperate with a new regime for Six Counties. 
7. These are the basic facts on which a new British policy will have 
to be based. It will also need to take due account of the following more general considerations: (a) The Catholic community in Northern Ireland is too large 
to be absorbed or ignored (as happened to the Protestants in the Republic after 1922) and too small to have any hope of ever forming the basis for an alternative government. It is believed in both communities that if there were no administrative discrimination against Catholics, and thus less Catholic emigration, the majority

Itself this is a negative aim, however desirable; it has no positive content unless it masks a hopeless desire to return to the status quo ante. It is therefore not a policy. It may well not be an option either. 
(2) 
Establishing a coalition government in Belfast. This might well be possible in the context of (iii) above: 
see para 17 below. But short of that, there 
would be no way of ensuring Catholic participation nor of preventing the Protestants from abusing their majority status within the coalition. 
(3) Hoping for change following British and Irish entry into the EEC. In the long run, this may well help a lot. But over the next couple of years it could do no more at most than act as part excuse for any joint action by Westminster and Dublin which we might be able to develop under (iii) above. 
10. Direct rule could be forced on us, in 1973 or sooner, because 
the alternative was clearly an extremist Protestant Government in Stormont; or it could be imposed at a moment of our own choosing in the interval. The latter would be preferable, not just to secure the tactical initiative but also to avoid the appearance of acting to stifle the verdict of democracy. Suitably prepared, direct rule would have such to commend it.

IRELAND THIS MORNING MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PHASE IN THE BATTLE AGINST THE IRA, IT WAS WORKED OUT AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF CLOSE CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE U.K. AND OF NORTHERN IRELAND. ITS SIGNIFICANCE IS THAT IT LAYS STREESS ON THE FACT THAT THE FUNCTION OF THE SECURITY FORCES IS NOT MERELY TO CONTAIN DISORDER AND VIOLENCE BUT TO SEARCH OUT THE MEN AND THE ORGANISATIONS RESPONSIBLE. THIS WILL BE PURSUED. IN THIS NEW PHASE THE SECURITY FORCES WILL ACT WITH THE UTMOST VIGOUR.

of gentle encouragement, without any attempt to force the pace. Mr Faulkner’s letter of 6 April to the Prime Minister 4. 
Mr Faulkner’s concern about the public presentation of 
any visit by Mr Lynch to London is understandable. On earlier occasions (eg when Dr Hillery has had talks here) we have agreed press guidance on the following lines: a. 
a wide range of matters was discussed, including 
Northern Ireland: b. 
kept informed: c. 
the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland is of course Constitutional matters were not discussed. 
We should seek to follow this pattern again and to obtain Mr Lynch’s agreement to doing so. Hitherto, the Irish have have not abused agreements on press guidance, and although the Dublin Press will be looking for headlines, it should not be impossible to reassure Mr Faulkner. Objective of Prime Minister’s meeting with Mr Lynch 5. An outline of the Prime Minister’s own ideas on this is given in his Private Secretary’s letter of 21 April. The first point, that in Northern Ireland the problem is now not one of civil rights but of eradicating terrorism is one we have already put to the Irish. Although they will not admit it publicly they accept privately that it has much truth. We must however expect Mr Lynch to argue for progress on reform to be kept up. This point is developed in paragraph 8 below. 6. 
What we can say to Mr Lynch about any tougher measures 
we may have decided to take in the North will depend on when the visit takes place. The GOC is to provide an interim

the power of the right wing extremists in the Unionist Constituency Associations. Mr Lynch fears that the next General Election in Northern Ireland (due in 1974) will undo all the progress of recent years by returning an extremist Government, not representative of the people but representative of the Unionist Constituency Associations. If PR were introduced, the minority opposition at Stormont, it is calculated, would gain between 3-6 seats. The change could not, however, take place for some time. b. 
Reform programme The measures agreed in 1969 are 
for the most part enacted or on the way. Mr Lynch now looks for an atmosphere favourable to continuing reform, and in particular for the association of Roman Catholics with the machinery of government. The sectarian basis of politics in Northern Ireland means that one-third of the population are, by their religious affiliation, permanently excluded from Government. The Irish are always anxious to see more nominated bodies on which minority representatives could serve. Mr Faulkner has promised to do his best about this; but progress is not easy because of the apparent inability of the minority to agree on nominees. Mr Lynch could be invited to help overcome this difficulty. c. 
North-South cooperation on such matters as Border 
economic affairs, joint North/South electricity programming, tourism and exchange of TV programmes. Results of the recent meeting of Northern Ireland and Irish Republic officials are not yet available, but the Prime Minister

e concerned with the whole rage of issues negotiations. It would, however, need to be made clear 
affecting Britain and the Republic, including the E.E.C. that Northern Ireland would be one of the subjects 
discussed, as it would be disingenuous to pretend otherwise. The Prime Minister agrees with the Home Secretary’s 
view, recorded in your letter of 21 April that, before the meeting with Mr Lynch, we should need to be as clear as possible about what we should wish to obtain from the meeting. He agrees that officials should now provide an assessment of what the objective should 
to Mr. Lynch that the problem in Northern Ireland was now not essentially that of improving the civil rights of the minority but of eradicating terrorism and that the continuance of Mr. Faulkner’s Government (and the 
would then 
be. The Prime Minister’s own conception of the purpose of the meeting is as follows. He would explain frankly 
avoidance of something worse) depends largely on solid progress being made on this issue. We 
explain such tougher measures as we might have it in mind to take (for example, on the border and on internment) so that, if and when these measures were taken, Mr. Lynch would understand the background and would be less likely to react adversely.
