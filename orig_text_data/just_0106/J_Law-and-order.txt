Where a breach of the peace is not committed, but the 
conduct of the pickets is intimidatory, they should be arrested only if there is no other way to get them to desist. In these circumstances the power of arrest to be used is SPA Regulation 11, in accordance with the Blue Card. The words to be used are: "I suspect you of being about to commit (or of committing) acts prejudicial to the peace".

The suggestion was made at the Ministers’ meeting on 9th February that one possibility might be to entrust law and order to a Governor having effective executive powers; he would be responsible to the United Kingdom Government, but the control would remain a local one. 
The main difficulty is that it seems 
unacceptable that, at any rate for more than a very brief period, responsibility for the main functions involved - control of the police, running the prisons, operating internment policy, all of which raise issues as to the rights and liberty of the subject should be exercised without there being ultimate responsibility to a democratically elected body; and responsibility to the United Kingdom Government would probably in the end turn out to be not very much different than if there were a direct transfer to Westminster.
