NIAE.
Few details have yet been worked out about the NIAE.
However,
it is likely that postal voting facilities and polling hours will be similar
to those for the LGE.
It is hoped that the number of polling stations will
be not greater than about 500 and that there will be fewer locations for the
counting of votes than for the LGE.

The Threat
8.

General.
a.
The current political and security situation is considered to be
generally encouraging, in that a significant proportion of the community is
increasingly expressing a desire for an end to violence.
The imminence of
the forthcoming elections has tended to direct the energies even of many
extremist elements towards political activities.
b.
Notwithstanding the elections themselves, the period from May to Aug
is the traditional "marching season" in Northern Ireland, starting with the
May Day parades and reaching a climax in July with the Orange Lodges'
celebrations.
Pre- and post-elections parades in addition to these
traditional marches can be expected.
It has been decided that there should
be no general ban on parades durin the elections period but SSNI will
continue to exercise his powers to ban or modify the routes of specific

parades if considered necessary.
c.
Although a full assessment of the threat to security during the elections
period cannot be made until nearer the time, general trends are discernible now.

9.

Attitudes of Protestant Community.
a.
Moderates.
The majority of moderate Protestants, although expressing
some reservations about the terms of the White Paper, seem disposed to follow
the Unionist Party line expounded by Mr Faulkner.
They are therefore likely
to contest and take part in the elections, although some may express
disapproval of certain provisions (eg the PR system and control of the police).
b.

Extremists.

The formation of the Vanguard United Progressive Party

(VUPP )and the United Loyalist Council (ULC) has for the moment concentrated
some of the extremists in political activity. However, VUPP has declared

its intention not to contest the LG and there are already signs that the
coalition of so many diverging interes t s, basically united only in their
oppositiontothe terms of the White Paper, is facing difficulties.
The
VUPP's decision not to fight the LGE; is a result of organizational weakeness,
rather than objections in principle to the holding of the elections; it is
probable that some of the constituent groups of VUPP will put forward
candidates in some form or other.
The need to fight elections with specific
manifestos is having its expected divisive effect and while this may, by
weakening the political effectiveness of the uneasy coalition, increase the
