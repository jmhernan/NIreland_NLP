40 CDO RM
1. As I am sure you
know, GOC Northern Ireland intends to
neutralize the Provisional IRA hard areas of Belfast (the Ardoyne,
New Lodge, Falls and Beahmount).
He has therefore decided to

redeploy some of his forces in the Province.
2.
In order to complete this plan, it is important that
HQ
Northern Ireland have not less than 69 companies in the infantry
role, at least until Sep/Oct this year.
I understand that
40 Cdo RM will deploy to Northern Ireland in mid Jun without its

affliated battery.
This means that when 42 Cdo RM (with its
battery) leaves Northern Ireland, the number of companies will fall

from the present level of 69 to 68.

3.
You will also know that the elections for the Northern Ireland
Assembly will be held on 28 Jun, andHQ Northern Ireland have been
examining the need for reinforcement to cover that event.
4.

I am therefore writing to ask you if you would be able to
ake available the battery affiliated to 40 Cdo RM for a 4 months
tourwith the Command.
VCGS, who visited Northern Ireland earlier
this week, discussed the whole matter with the GOC and other
commanders in Belfast.
VCGS is convinced that HQ Northern Ireland's
request for this battery is well founded, and it is probably no
exaggeration to say that if the battery is deployed, the GOC will
not have to call for any extra reinforcements over the Jun elections

and Jul marches period.
I
I would be most grateful for any help you can give us.

an sure you will agree that the addition of the battery

is the most economical and sensible way to meet GOC Northern

Ireland's requirement.
