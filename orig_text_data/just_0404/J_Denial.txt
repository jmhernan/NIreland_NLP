he Lord Chancellor tells me that it would be possible to devise a procedure for such circumstances which could nevertheless be regarded as judicial. The procedure would have to be very different from court procedure as known in this country. It would be inquisitorial; the court would be able to ask the accused questions and draw inferences from refusal to answer; material provided on deposition could also be put to the accused. We might also provide that hearsay evidence was to be admissible (and this would undoubtedly increase the number of cases in which we might look for a conviction). The court would need to be given power to impose a sentence instead of an open-ended internment order.

But we all deplore the circumstances 
which have led to internment; /and we welcome the assurance of the Government of Northern Ireland that every effort will be made to ensure that all those who wish to avail themselves of their statutory right to appeal against their continued detention will be enabled to do so as rapidly as possible and that the number of those held in internment will be reduced to the minimum constituting an indisputable threat to public security].

Because he was known to be bringing this The 
other 97 have, however, since been interned and the Northern Ireland Government have been advised by their lawyers that the internment cancels out any defect in the arresting procedure at the time of detention.

Internees were all given notice of their rights and were allowed legal advice in the preparation of their cases; but legal representation was not allowed at their appearance before the Committee, which was conducted in strict confidence with only the members of the Committee present, each of whom was provided with the relevant documents.

As for the handful of cases where the Compton Committee thought 
that people suffered ill-treatment at the time of arrest or at a Regional Holding Centre - for example, the case of Mr. Cummings who was hooded and bound as a military precaution -, I can only say that it speaks volumes for the discipline and common sense of the many soldiers who were engaged in this large-scale and dangerous operation in which a total of 342 arrests were made that there were so very few cases of this kind and that when they did occur, on no occasion, in the Committee’s view, was ill-treatment deliberate.

No. As the Compton Report makes clear, the allegations that those of Mr. Cummings and Mr. 
Gilmore - did the Committee find that those arrested had suffered a measure of physical ill-treatment at the time of arrest, and this 
was not deliberate. When this is set against the total of 342 arrests which the troops made on 9 August, I can see little reason for changing the Army’s orders about arresting people.

What about alleg ations that in several cases the Army arrested the wrong men or seized relatives if they could not get the person they wanted? 
A. In an operation of the kind that was carried out on 9 August 
there were bound to be some cases of mistaken identity. More often than not these could not be sorted out on the snot but once it was established that an arrested man was not the person who was wanted he was released. 
I am not aware of any cases where it has been shown that troops 
arrested people who were not wanted simply because they could not find the person they were looking for.

Despite 
provocations of which the Press and other public media give us daily evidence, those responsible for arrests have carried out their duties with a high regard for humanitarian principles.
