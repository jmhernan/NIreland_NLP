Moreover, it was not a 
question of regarding a ban on marches as some kind of political offset against internment. The Protestants in Northern Ireland would regard internment as no more than a merited punishment for the violence of the IRA and their Roman Catholic supporters; they would not see it at all as something which required a corresponding gesture on the part of themselves. Since the Government would need full Protestant support for any new initiatives on political reconciliation which they might be able to undertake, it would be foolish to alienate Protestant support by an indiscriminate ban on marches.

As you know, although the main Protestant parades of July 
passed off without giving rise to any serious incidents, there has been a significant worsening in recent weeks in the amount and nature of terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, with frequent bomb attacks on an increasing scale and also the outbreaks of extremely vicious street fighting in Londonderry where there had previously been very little trouble for many months. This activity is clearly the work of the IRA; and the GOC has confirmed that the signs are that this body is getting better organised and more efficient in its methods. Earlier this week the GOC reported to the Defence Secretary, and also to the Home Secretary, that renewed pressure was building up within Mr. Faulkner’s Government for firm action against the IRA; and Mr. Faulkner has himself been in touch with the Home Secretary to suggest that the time may have come to think again about internment.
