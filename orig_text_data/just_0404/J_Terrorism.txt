The Secretary of State said that he could not risk ending internment without an end of violence. If major acts of terrorism took place after the ending of internment his position would be impossible. If there were a genuine end of terrorism,even for a limited period, there would be a genuine response from the Governmentand,subject to consultations with his colleagues, he did not rule out the ending of internment in these circumstances.

The answer was that there were reports of varying reliability that up to 25 (of 380 or so who had been released by them) had returned to more or less active membership of the IRA - 
which did not 
necessarily mean that they had themselves become active terrorists again. This is obviously a very much smaller proportion than the one-quarter alleged by the Daily Express.

Moreover, it was not a 
question of regarding a ban on marches as some kind of political offset against internment. The Protestants in Northern Ireland would regard internment as no more than a merited punishment for the violence of the IRA and their Roman Catholic supporters; they would not see it at all as something which required a corresponding gesture on the part of themselves. Since the Government would need full Protestant support for any new initiatives on political reconciliation which they might be able to undertake, it would be foolish to alienate Protestant support by an indiscriminate ban on marches.

As you know, although the main Protestant parades of July 
passed off without giving rise to any serious incidents, there has been a significant worsening in recent weeks in the amount and nature of terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, with frequent bomb attacks on an increasing scale and also the outbreaks of extremely vicious street fighting in Londonderry where there had previously been very little trouble for many months. This activity is clearly the work of the IRA; and the GOC has confirmed that the signs are that this body is getting better organised and more efficient in its methods. Earlier this week the GOC reported to the Defence Secretary, and also to the Home Secretary, that renewed pressure was building up within Mr. Faulkner’s Government for firm action against the IRA; and Mr. Faulkner has himself been in touch with the Home Secretary to suggest that the time may have come to think again about internment.
