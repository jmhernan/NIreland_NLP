The reason for internment is that while a good deal is 
known about internees, the evidence, such as it is, would not in most cases stand up in court according to normal legal tests; further, even if the evidence were sufficient, there would be obvious objections to disclosing its nature to the defence or allowing a confrontation between the security forces and the accused. It is, therefore, sometimes suggested that special courts should be set up with their own procedure so that in appropriate cases persons at present interned could be brought before them.

Security policies will inevitably be resented in those sections of the community in which are found those deemed to be working against the security of the whole community.

We understand that the authorities accepted that in consequence of this security requirement, the operation would be carried out with a considerable element of local improvisation and might be attended by some administrative confusion, but that they considered this to be the lesser evil in relation to the paramount need to maintain security and achieve surprise.
