Lord Windlesham explained that in the Secretary of State’s absence he was being invited to sign a Detention Order for a prisoner whom the RUC thought should be interrogated for longer than the 48-hour period which they would otherwise have been limited to. Because of the strong recommendation made to him, Lord Windlesham intended to sign this Detention Order, but before doing so asked that Mr Johnston should explain to him the process of interrogation which the man was now likely to face.

The judges’ rules were simply not compatible with the gaining of intelligence. In Mr Johnston’s view it was still essential to gain intelligence 
- the initiative might fail, or it might take a 
long time to succeed: in any event it would be wrong of the security forces not to keep themselves well informed of the threat of subversion. Interrogation was necessary to produce the intelligence which the security forces needed.
