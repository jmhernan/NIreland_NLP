2. I am writing to inform you and our colleagues on the DPC 
of a further temporary deployment of United Kingdom troops to Northern Ireland. 
August is traditionally a time of increased sectarian 
activity in Northern Ireland and the Second Battalian, the Queen’s Regiment, normally stationed at Werl in Germany are, along with other units, being sent to Northern Ireland on 3 August to assist in maintaining order. This move will temporarily increase the number of BAOR units in Northern Ireland to five, but on current plans the unit should be back in BAOR by 31 August.

In diocusions with the police atan doubts have arisen as to these Regulations. 
The proedure apparently falls into throe steest arreant for purposes of Lnterrogations followed normally by a detention order to coor further enquiries, followed by an internment order where no charges are preferred

eglation 10 enables the police to arrest and detain a person for up to 48 hours But the regulation givoa no similar poor 
suspects to be put temporarily out of the way during a particular :oyal Visit. It was not drafted as part of detention and internment procedure. 
Furthermore, the original purpose of the Regulation ws to enable Should it, 
therefore, be ignored and Regulation 11 used instead as authority to make arrests? 
If so, oan a peron be interroptod under Regulation 11 ponding the making of a detontion order? How soon should a detention order be applied. ibr? Can he be interroentod thereafter? The purpose of intrrogation is, of coure, to establish the identity of other members of subversive organizationss rather than to aable a oharCe to be preferred against the person interrodntod. 
It is not proposed that 
he should be able to call upon his solicitor until after the period of interrogation. During thin period in he protoctod by the Judges Rules? 
Under Regulation 11(2) a person ay be detained by ardor until (a) he bas been dischared by direction of the Attorney-Geneml or (b) he is brought before a Court of uraarys

THE ROYAL COURTS OF JUSTICE(ULSTER) BELFAST BT1 3JY. 
22nd July, 1971. Dear Harris, 
Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act 1922 Regulations 10 11 and 12 
1. Thank you for your letter about the above and if any 
further queries arise out of this letter I will be pleaed to discuss the matters further with you or anyone else concerned. 
2. 
Regulation 10 Regulation 10 enables an officer of the Royal Ulster 
Constabulary to authorise the arrest without warrant and detention for a period of not more than 48 hours for the purpose of interrogation. The distinction is made throughout the Regulations between a "police constable" on the one hand and a "police officer" on the other hand and Regulation 10 is therefore wide enough - 
and I think is intended 
to enable a police officer to authorise either a police constable or a member of H.M. Forces to arrest without warrant for this period and for this purpose. It is a valuable regulation and it should not be ignored but it does presuppose a specific authorisation by an officer of the R.U.C. 
3. 
Regulation 11 Regulation 11 enables three categories of persons to mak 
an arrest without warrant in certain circumstances - general 
suspicious circumstances. The three categories of persons are (l) any police constable; (2) any soldier on duty; and (3) any person authorised for the purpose by the Minister of Home Affairs. This Regulation differs from Regulation 10 in that the person arresting must suspect the person arrested of

YOUR TEL NOS 146 AND 147. 1. I HAVE TWO GENERAL POINTS. FIRST, MR. LYNCH WILL ONLY INTRODUCE INTERNMENT IF THIS IS JUDGED NECESSARY FOR DOMESTIC REASONS - 
THAT IS, IF THE IRISH GOVERNMENT FEELS THAT THERE IS8 NO OTHER 
MEANS OF MAINTAINING PUBLIC ORDER IN THE REPUBLIC. SECONDLY, IF I SPEAK TO MR LYNCH ON PURELY HYPOTHETICAL LINES, AS IN YOUR TELEGRAMS, HIS FORMAL REPLY WILL PROBABLY BE THAT HE CANNOT GIVE AN ANSWER TO A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION. HE MAY BE WILLING TO HAVE A CONFIDENTIAL TALK ON HOW HE NOW PERSONALLY SEES THE DIFFICULTIES FACING HIM OVER INTERMENT, BUT HE WILL NOT COMMIT HIMSELF, NOR WILL HIS VIEWS NECESSARILY COINCIDE WITH THOSE OF HIS COLLEAGUES. ALTERNATIVELY, IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE IRISH WILL DO SHOULD WE INTERN IN THE NORTH, IN TERMS OF INDiCATIONS WHICH WE CAN USE IN PLANNING OUR OWN INTERMENT OPERATION, I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO TELL MR LYNCH THAT THERE. IS A LIKELIHOOD THAT INTERNMENT WILL BE INTRODUCED WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS (OR WHENEVER) AND ASK. HIM, AFTER CONSULTING WITH HIS COLLEAGUES, FOR SOME INDICATION OF WHAT HIS REACTIONS WOULD BE ONLY BY CONFRONTING THE IRISH WITH A SITUATION IN WHICH THEY HAVE TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS CAN WE EXTRACT A USEFUL ANSWER. 
2. WITHIN THESE LIMITS, I SEE NO DIFFICULTY IN DISCUSSING THIS WITH MR LYNCH. I CAN USUALLY ARRANGE A DISCREET MEETING AT A FEW DAYS NOTICE, ALTHOUGH EVERY HOVE I MAKE IS BEING VERY CLOSELY WATCHED AT PRESENT. WHILE THE ISSUE OF INTERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED AS IT HAS BEEN, BY IRISH MINISTERS, I THINK WE CAN RELY ON HIS DISCRETION ABOUT THIS APPROACH. 
3. IN FACT, I THIHK WE WOULD VALUE BEING CONSULTED IN THIS WAY: AND TO DO IT THOROUGHLY, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SHOD AND GO THROUGH VITH HIM (BUT NOT OF COURSE TO RETAIN) A DOCUMENT ON THE LINES OF YOUR TEL N0 147. I WUOLD, HOWEVER, LIKE TO SUGGEST CERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO PARA 3. FIRST, I WUOLD LIKE TO ADD AFTER ’’ CROSS THE BORDER’’ THE WORDS ’’ AND ADD TO THE ALREADY RECOGNISED THREAT IN".

The Chairman said that the meeting would not be concerned with policy 
decisions about internment but it was noted that any decision by the Northern Ireland Government to introduce internment would require prior consultation with United Kingdom Ministers. 
It would, however, be useful to consider 
what progress had been made with contingency planning. The Northern Ireland Government representatives said that plans were in 
hand but it had not been possible to take them very far partly because of the need to preserve security and partly because it was not possible at this stage to say how many people would be picked up when the plan went into operation. 
It could be anything between 30 and 300. Detention orders 
would be prepared beforehand for each individual who might be involved and these could be signed after arrest, if necessary.

withdrawal of one major firm could start an exodus. Ministers in the Northern Ireland Government favoured internment. 
Some, perhaps most, of the Mr. Smith’s, 
assessment was that internment in Northern Ireland would upset the IRA but would’ not prevent their carrying on their activities. 
If internment in Northern 
roland could be accompanied by internment in the Republic the political, difficulties would be largely overcome and the effectiveness of the action greatly increased. 
Mr. Smith suggested that a ajor effort should be made to 
persuade the Prime inister of the Republic to adopt internment. A special emissary might be sent to Dublin. Mr. Smith said that short of internment it was possible to consider 
restricting the moveent in Northern Ireland of undesirable persons, such as Brady. 
Brady had recently come to Northern Ireland to address a ncetin. The Special Branch had not told the army that they wanted to question him and he

In the meantime, it seems to me that the points which could usefully

(b) the Northern Ireland Government to buy the premises but to pay 
rent for the land; (c) the Northern Ireland Government to rent the premises and land

in capital works? (ii) if (a) is decided on, would there be a requirement to give the

Reference: A. BR/027)/D1 16 of 25 Jun 71 B. Letter from Col Macdiarmid of 9 Jun 71 C. Letter from Lt Col Brennan of 21 Jun 71 D. Pol F.11 Supp A of 14 Jun 71 
1. 2. You will recollect that we spoke together briefly about the 
attached references. On reflection I feel that we must give the matter more thought. 
I suggest that any reply should be on the lines that:a. 
with only the minimum Army support and supervision, (which, if it is not a joint operation, should in fact be deniable). 
b. 3. The methods used should be such as to allow 
HNG to endorse them as publicly acceptable if forced to do so. 
However, you may feel that a more comprehensive reply is not 
possible without additional information, such as:a. b. 
What are the actual methods proposed? What exact degree of supervision/support will 
be required from the Army? c. 
What are the intelligence benefits of keeping 
the interrogation process quiet? d. 
Northern Ireland view point? 
4. I have no doubt that the interrogation process will be the subject of intense public scrutiny. Various organisations like Amnesty International will go out of their way to see that it is. It may behove us therefore to accept internment and interrogation 
as a joint RUC/mil operation from the start and inform HQ Northern land to plan it accordingly. I think it is the firm steer which 
HQ Northern Ireland is lacking. Given this, they can be left to work out the details. But they need to answer some of their own questions first. 
I suggest that you, Col MSI(OT) and I meet to discuss our broach. You may wish to elevate it to AU8(GS)/BGS(Int)/DMO level?

July 1971 
LONG KESH III - ADDITIONAL FACILITIES FOR VISITORS Reference A: A/57/Engrs 6756(Engr 1A) dated 1 June 1971 
1. 2. Despite paragraph 4 of Annex A to Reference A, it has been necessary to agree with 
Home Office that there is a requirement to increase the facilities for visitors at present planned in Hut 11 (Dwg No 62/39/7 refers). 
It has therefore become necessary to alter the layout of Hut 11, retaining the 
"Identification" and "Search" rooms (for marshalling visitees) and the visitors toilets, but converting the rest of.the area into visitor cubicles as indicated on the amended drawing enclosed. This will provide 21 cubicles, as opposed to the 7 on the present plan. 
3. To compensate for this, it will be necessary to erect a further 24’ x 66’6" Nissen 
as a Reception Centre, which must provide the some facilities as the present Hut II but without the visitors section. The "spare" space could be obsorbed by two further rooms on either side of a central corridor, or alternatively by shortening the building (See sketch attached). 
4. The suggested portion of the new hut, provisionally labelled "11A" is shown on 
Drawing 62/329/1 attached. It is necessary to run in electricity water and sullage drainage only; we suggest that placing sinks back to back, and using a raised trap outide the building will solve the problem of fall and a connection can be made to manhole 
16 (see Dwg 62/329/23) without recourse to major alterations to drainage levels. Small bore drain pipe (2" Dia) would be acceptable, since the sinks will have strainers fitted. Casting of the hut base will not involve drainage ducts and should be done as part of the current contract. 
5. 
It is understood that one additional but has been "found" locally, so that the new "11A" will involve only internal fittings, and service connections additional to the 
present stores lists. 6. 
In terms of priorities, it is essential that Hut 11A is available for use 
immediately Phase III is completed; Hut 11 should therefore take lower priority, but both should be completed desirably as part of Phase I (leaving out the actual cubicle partitions in Hut 11 until Phase III is ordered). 
7. Please agree that this work can be undertaken, and arrange for drawing, stores 
lists, and pricing to be produced. Please also indicate what effect this alteration a have on completion dates for Phases I and II.

sufficiently for your Minister. They refer to pronouncements made by Messrs Chichester-Clark, Faulkner, Heath and Maudling. 
I think the Home

Northern Ireland Dr. Hillery called on me on 6 July. his Government would keep up pressure on the IRA. 
I said we hoped His 
showed that he wanted to be helpful but he was typically difficult to pin down. 
We shall keep up the pressure 
the Irish Government through our Embassy in Dublin and t IRA problem will be the central point t Mr. Lynch when he comes here in October. 2. 
There was another point to which Dr. Hillery frequently 
returned: namely the grave risks attending the Apprentice Boys’ March in Londonderry on 12 August. 
He was particularly 
concerned lest this march, if it took place, might contribute to the current worsening of the situation. 
He feared that 
the minority would see the march as a reaffirmation by irreconcilable Orange elements of their determination to maintain a dominant role; apparently many of the Apprentice Boys come from far afield, and in consequence the mar more keenly resented by the minority than are local marches elsewhere. 3. 
I undertook to pass this point to you. 
Dr. Hillery hardly mentioned the July marches. Cancellation 
of the march might ease the current tension in Londonderry when announced, as well as help Anglo-Irish relations.

MO 19/3/1 9th July 1971 In my letter to you of 24th June I informed you 
of the Defence Secretary’s plans for reinforcing the Army in Northern Ireland for the period of the major traditional Orange Marches, culminating in those of 12th July 
- for 
which purpose he had decided to add two extra units (bringing the total to 14 units in the infantry role). 
Since then - and in fact since the NI meeting on 6th 
July - there have been fresh intelligence reports, details of which are still coming in, of indications that the IRA plan to make concerted attacks on the Orange parades in a number of different localities, both in Belfast and around the Province. Were this to happen, there would obviously be a risk of Protestant retaliation on a substantial scale, leading to really serious rioting. Both the GOC and the Ministry of Defence have considered this intelligence very carefully and have come to the conclusion that, while the reports may be unduly alarmist, there are reasonable grounds for believing that the threat to security on 12th July may be rather more serious than we have hitherto provide for. 
The Defence Secretary has accepted this conclusion 
and, having regard to the great importance of getting through the summer with the minimum of serious clashes, and to the success of the tactics which have been employed so far this year of saturating the potential flashpoints with troops and police, he has agreed that it would be right to add one more Battalion to the reinforcement for the period immediately before and after 12 
July. Accordingly, the unit which as 
most recently been acting as the NI spearhead Battalion 1 KOSB, stationed at Edinburgh-will move to Belfast this evening - the intention being that it should return on he morning of 13th July, all being well. I am sending copies of this letter to Angel (Home Office), 
Barrington (FCO) and Norbury (Cabinet). (A.W. STEPHENS)

Ministerial Committee on Northern Ireland 
As you may know, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary 
is in Scotland, and neither the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster nor Mr. Godber are able to stand in for him at tomorrow’s meeting at 10.45 a.m. This letter summarises Sir Alec Douglas-Home’s views. 
UDR Full Time Battalion (NI(71)6) We accept the military arguments. We endorse the view 
that the attitude of the Roman Catholic community will be crucial and agree the recommendation that the proposal be reconsidered in September, since this gives time for the present hostile reaction amongst Roman Catholics to be countered. This delay will also provide an opportunity to explain the proposal in Dublin, where the reaction so far has been hostile. 
Control of Northern Ireland Borders (NI(71)5) There are signs that Mr. Lynch himself would welcome 
We support therefore the 
firmer action against the IRA, even though domestic political considerations prevent him from doing much publicly in 
favour of this course, and there are hopes of building up a measure of quiet co-operation. 
Defence Secretary’s views. I am sending copies of this letter to Graham Angel, 
Robert Andrew and Leonard Davies, as well as to Brian Norbury.

Ref. A09981 
UDR Full-time Battalion (NI(71) 6) 
Although this proposal was last discussed by the Committee 
(on 27th April) in the context of the GOC’s border study, the military case for creating the unit is based on its general utility in relieving the strain on our Regular Forces in Northern Ireland. The Army consider that there are reasonable recruitment possibilities and that there are plenty of tasks for the unit without infringing the restriction that the UDR are not to be used for crowd control in towns. 2. 
Premature publicity, however, has resulted in Opposition 
expressions of hostility to the proposal; and it is clear that, in the present atmosphere, we could not hope for a bipartisan approach to any proposals for legislation. 
(This could be very damaging - as is emphasised in 
paragraph 1(c) - to the chances of increasing the Roman Catholic element in the force - which, at only 131/2 per cent, is lamentably low). Nor can it really be claimed that the measure is of such critical importance as to justify disrupting the broad identity of approach to the Irish problem which both Front Benches have so far maintained. Even if the force were established, its contribution of about 300 men by the middle of 1972 (see paragraph 1(b) of the paper) could hardly be more than marginal. Moreover, some of the detailed conditions of service (e.g. the period of engagement of three years proposed in paragraph 7 of the Annex) could be relied on to generate disproportionate heat. 3. 
In paragraph 4 of NI(71) 6 the Secretary of State accordingly 
proposes that the idea should be reconsidered in September and that in the meantime he and the Home Secretary should explain the proposal privately to senior members of the Opposition. This implies a provisional agreement on the part of the Committee at least to keep the idea open. Presumably, however, it will be put to the Opposition members without commitment, merely as a proposal which the Government are considering. 4. 
There may well be an argument about costs, with the Ministry of 
Defence claiming that these should come from outside existing Defence Budget allocations. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State might be invited to settle the matter between themselves, 
or, failing 
this, to produce a joint paper explaining their disagreement, which could also be taken in September.

CONFIDENTIAL TO PRIORITY F C 0 TELEGRAM NUMBER 223 OF 1 JULY, INFO UKREP BELFAST. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE IRISH IN LONDON 
1. I ASKED EAMON GALLAGHER TODAY WHAT POINTS WERE LIKELY TO BE RAISED BY IRISH OFFICIALS IN LONDON NEXT WEEK. GALLAGHER SAID THAT TWO OF THE POINTS LIKELY TO BE RAISED WERE POLICY FOR-THE PARADE SEASON, AND SOME POINTS ON WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED ’’THE PARTICIPATION DEBATE’’ AT STORMONT. 2. AS TO PARADES, HE SAID THAT BY FAR THE MOST DANGEROUS WOULD BE THE APPRENTICE PARADE AT LONDONDERRY ON 12 AUGUST. THE DANGER LAY IN THE ELEMENT OF PROVOCATION WHICH THE PARADE INVOLVED, AND THIS WOULD LEAD TO VIOLENCE AFTER THE PARADE HAD DISPERSED. IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SANITISE THE PARADE ITSELF BY APPROPRIATE SECURITY MEASURES, BUT A PROVOCATIVE ELEMENT WAS THE NATURE OF THE PARADE, AND THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF THE APPRENTICE BOYS CAME FROM OTHER AREAS, SOME EVEN FROM LIVERPOOL AND GLASGOW. IF THE PARADE WERE HELD, THE VIOLENCE ’WHICH FOLLOWED WOULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE RELATIONS, WHICH AT PRESENT WERE EXEMPLARY, BETWEEN THE RUC AND THE LOCAL POPULATION. HE DID NOT THINK THAT THE DIFFICULTY COULD BE MET BE RE-ROUTINE,EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF FOLLOWING THE APPARENTLY INNOCUOUS ’’ WATERSIDE ROUTE’’. THE DANGER AT LONDONDERRY WAS FUNDEMENTAL. EXTREMIST ELEMENTS FROM BELFAST COULD BE EXPECTED TO TAKE PART IN THE VIOLENCE. THERE WAS NO REAL ALTERNATIVE TO BANNING THE PARADE. 3. AS TO THE EVENTS ON 12 JULY, GALLAGHER HAD BEEN GIVING THOUGHT TO THE 19 PARADES WHICH WERE PLANNED. HIS PRESENT FEELING WAS THAT THE PARADE AT STRABANE NEEDED PARTICULARLY CLOSE WATCHING, AND ON A LOWER LEVEL THE PARADES AT ENNISKILLEN AND BALLYCASTLE HE DID NOT ARGUE THAT THESE PARADES SHOULD NECESSARILY BE BANNED BUT THAT THEY SHOULD BE TREATED AS POSSIBLE FLASH POINTS. THE SAME MIGHT BE TRUE OF TWO OR THREE OTHER PARADES ON 12 JULY, TO WHICH HE WOULD GIVE FURTHER THOUGHT. 4. IN A RUDIMENTARY CLASSIFICATION, GALLAGHER SAID THAT STRABANE MIGHT BE A 3 STAR RISK, AND ENNISKILLEN AND BALLYCASTLE A 1 STAR’ RISK, BUT LONDONDERRY 0N 12 AUGUST WAS AT LEAST A 5 STAR RISK.

31 JULY. 
MR. LYNCH’S REACTION, WHILE CALM AND COURTEOUS, WAS FIRM AND IMMEDIATE. HIS TREATMENT OF THE SUBJECT BROUGHT OUT THREE POINTS VERY CLEARLY:- (A) THE NARROW LIMITS WITHIN WHICH ANY IRISH GOVERNMENT CAN OPERATE (B) THE CERTAINTY THAT THEY WILL DO WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO FOR DOMESTIC REASONS ONLY, AND NOT IN ORDER TO HELP US TO PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO IN THE NORTH (C) MR. LYNCH’S CONCERN WITH THE IMMEDIATE SITUATION IN THE NORTH RATHER THAN WITH REUNIFICATION. WE HEED CONSTANTLY TO REMEMBER THAT HIS OWN AIM IS REUNIFICATION, AND HE WOULD NOT BE TAOISEACH IF IT WERE NOT, AND ON CERTAIN OCCASIONS HE HAS TO SAY SO IN ORDER TO REMAIN TAOISEACH. BUT IT IS A LONG-TERM AIM TO BE APPROACHED GENTLY, AND HIS OVER-RIDING PREOCCUPATION REGARDING THE NORTH IS PEACE, SECURITY, AND JUSTICE NOW FOR THE CATHOLIC MINORITY. HIS EARNEST AND SINCERE ADVICE IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE THAT IT iS BY CONCENTRATING ON THESE THAT WE SHALL DEFEAT THE I.R.A., A SUBJECT ON WHICH: HE IS OF COURSE AN INTERESTED PARTY. MOREOVER, HE IS CONVINCED THAT OUR DIFFICULTIES COULD BE LARGELY OVERCOME IF WE COULD SOMEHOW REFORMULATE OUR ATTITUDE ON THE LONG-TERM CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION SO AS TO GIVE A GLIMMER OF LIGHT AT THE END OF A LONG TUNNEL TO THE INCREASINGLY DESPONDENT AND CONSEQUENTLY BLOODY-MINDED MINORITY. 
2. MR. LYNCH MADE CLEAR THAT HE HOPES THAT THE CURRENT ROUND OF PUBLIC DECLARATIONS ABOUT THE NORTH HAS NOW ENDED, AND HE FERVENTLY HOPES ThE DAIL WILL GO INTO RECESS AS SOON AS POSSIbLE (I NOW KNOW THAT IT RECESSES ON 6 AUGUST).

TO FLASH FCO TELNO 290 OF 30 JULY INFO PRIORITY UKREP BELFAST. 
YOUR TELEGRAM 148. I SAW THE TAOISEACH AT 3.00 P.M. TODAY AND HAD A LONG AND FRANK DISCUSSION. I PREFIXED IT BY SAYING THAT OSTENSIBLY, IF MY VISIT WERE NOTICED, IT CONCERNED HIS VISIT TO LONDON, BUT ACTUALLY IT WAS TO DISCUSS A SECRET MATTER, AND THE FACT THAT WE HAD DISCUSSED IT WOULD NOT BE DISCLOSED. I THEN SHOWED HIM THE AGREED TEXT AND SPOKE AS INSTRUCTED. I MADE TWO COMMENTS, FIRST THAT THE RECURRING WORD PARALLEL DID NOT MEAN SIMULTANEOUS OR CONCERTED, AND SECONDLY THAT THE WORD HYPOTHETICAL IN THE PENULTIMATE PARAGRAPH ONLY MEANT THAT NO FINAL DECISION HAD YET BEEN TAKEN. 
2. MR. LYNCH STUDIED THE DOCUMENT CAREFULLY AND HANDED IT BACK. HE SAID THAT HE COULD STATE CATEGORICALLY THAT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY CONTEMPLATE INTERNMENT AT THE PRESENT TIME, THERE WERE NO IMMEDIATE GROUNDS FOR DOING SO, AND IF HE TRIED TO INTRODUCE IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF OUR DOING SO, NEITHER HIS NOR ANY IRISH GOVERNMENT COULD SURVIVE SUCH A MEASURE. IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY HAD THREATENED IT IN A SPECIAL INTERNAL SITUATION LAST DECEMBER, AND THE THREAT HAD APPARENTLY SUCCEEDED. HE COULD INTRODUCE IT AS A DRASTIC MEASURE IF THERE.WERE A TOTAL BREAKDOWN OF THE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. CERTAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE WAS FAR FROM PERFECT, BUT NEITHER NOW NOR IN THE VISIBLE FUTURE DID THERE SEEM TO BE ANY GROUNDS FOR INTRODUCING INTERNMENT. IN REPLY TO A COMMENT, HE SAID THAT A MASSIVE INFLUX OF I.R.A. FROM THE NORTH MIGHT CAUSE SOME FURTHER LAWLESSNESS IN THE SOUTH, BUT HE WOULD NOT EXPECT IT TO BE UNMANAGEABLE AND IT OFFERED NO GROUNDS FOR PREVENTIVE ACTION IN ADVANCE. 
3. MR. LYNCH THEN URGED THAT WE SHOULD REFLECT VERY SERIOUSLY BEFORE TAKING THE GRAVE STEP OF INTRODUCING INTERNMENT IN THE NORTH. HE FEARED THAT IT WOULD PRODUCE AN EXPLOSION WHICH IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTAIN. WHEN I ASKED HIM HOW, HE SAID THAT IN THE PRESENT SITUATION, QUOTE IF YOU ROUND UP 1,00

30 JULY, 
YOUR TELEGRAMS NUMBER 283 AND 284. YOU SHOULD SEEK EARLIEST POSSIBLE MEETING WITH MR. LYNCH, IF POSSIBLE ON 31 JULY AND RAISE THE INTERNMENT QUESTION WITH HIM. OSTENSIBLE REASON FOR YOUR CALL MIGHT BE TO FOLLOW UP YESTERDAY’S ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS VISIT TO LONDON IN OCTOBER, TO ASCERTAIN OF WHOM HIS PARTY WILL CONSIST AND WHETHER HE HAS ANY PARTICULAR WISHES ABOUT THE PROGRAMME. 
2. APPROACH SHOULD BE ON THE BASIS OF TEXT IN MY TELNO 147 OF 27 JULY INCORPORATING THE CHANGES SUGGESTED IN PARA. 3 OF YOUR TELNO 283 YOU MAY GO THROUGH THE TEXT BUT SHOULD NOT LEAVE A COPY WITH HIM. 
WITH REGARD TO YOUR PARA. 4 (V) THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO YOUR REFERRING TO PRESSURES, BUT YOU SHOULD STRESS THAT DECISION WOULD BE BASED ON SECURITY ASSESSMENT. 
3. FOR YOUR PERSONAL.INFORMATION ONLY, MINISTERS ARE CONTEMPLATING A DISCUSSION, PROBABLY EARLY NEXT WEEK, WITH MR. FAULKNER. THEY HAVE IT IN MIND TO EXPLORE WITH HIM THE POSSIBILITY OF A BAN ON ALL MARCHES INCLUDING THAT OF 12 AUGUST, AND WHETHER THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED ONLY AS PART OF A PACKAGE DEAL WHICH WOULD ALSO INCLUDE INTERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
4. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND YOU SHOULD BE GUIDED BY FOLLOWING ON THE POINTS OF SUBSTANCE: (A) THE APPROACH IS NOT PURELY HYPOTHETICAL BUT ALONG THE LINES OF THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE IN PARA. 1 OF YOUR TEL 283. YOU CAN SAY THAT RECENT EVENTS HAVE OBVIOUSLY STRENGTHENED THE PROBABILITIES OF INTERNMENT BEING INTRODUCED IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND IT IS BEING SERIOUSLY THOUGHT ABOUT AS A POSSIBLE NEXT MOVE. WE THEREFORE SHOULD BE GRTATEFUL FOR A SUBSTANTIVE REACTION ON THIS

TO UKREP BELFAST. M.I.P.T.: DIRECT RULE. 1. THE IRISH GOVERNMENT’S ATTITUDE TO DIRECT RULE IS FLUID AND AT TIMES SCHIZOPHRENIC. ON THE ONE HAND, THEY WOULD WELCOME IT IF IT PREVENTED A STORONT GOVERNMENT LED BY CRAIG OR PAISLEY: OR IF IT MARKED THE END OF UNIONIST RULE IN STORMONT: AND AS EVIDENCE THAT HMG ACCEPTED THAT THE 1921 SETTLEMENT WAS UNWORKABLE AND ANOTHER ’’ SOLUTION’’ HAD TO BE FOUND. ON THE OTHER HAND, DIRECT RULE WOULD MAKE MR. LYNCH’S POLICY OF SETTLING THE PARTITION PROBLEM BETWEEN TWO IRISH ’’TRADITIONS’’ LESS PLAUSIBLE, THERE WOULD BE A DANGER THAT IN TIME NORTHERN IRELAND MIGHT BECOME EVEN MORE INTEGRATED INTO THE U.K. AND IT WOULD FINALLY REMOVE THE ARENA OF ARGUMENT FROM BELFAST, WHERE THE MINORITY AT LEAST HAVE A VOICE, TO WESTMINSTER WHERE IN EFFECT THEY DO NOT. (THIS ARGUMENT HAS LESS FORCE NOW THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS LEFT STORMONT). PUBLICLY, AND PROBABLY IN FACT, THE FORMER VIEW WOULD PREVAIL. 
2. IN THE CONTEXT OF A TALK WITH MR LYNCH ABOUT INTERNMENT, THE POINT ABOUT DIRECT RULE IS RELEVANT IN THREE CASES: FIRST AS AN ALTERNATIVE - I.E. IF HMG HAD DECIDED THAT THEY THEMSELVES WOULD NOT INTRODUCE INTERNMENT, BUT WOULD ASSUME CONTROL OF EVENTS INSTEAD: SECONDLY, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INTERNING AS MANY PROTESTANTS AS I R A EXTREMISTS, RESULTING IN THE COLLAPSE OF MR. FAULKNER’S GOVERNMENT UNDER RIGHT-WING INDIGNATION: THIRDLY, IF HMG ASSUMED DIRECT RULE AND AT THE SAME TIME INTRODUCED INTERNMENT. BUT IN ANY CASE, A DECISION TO INTRODUCE INTERNMENT, APPARENTLY TAKEN BY THE FAULKNER GOVERNMENT, WOULD BE REGARDED IN DUBLIN AS AN INSTANCE OF DIRECT RULE SINCE THE IRISH GOVERNMENT KNOW THAT THE DECISION WOULD IN EFFECT BE TAKEN IN LONDON.

This memorandum discusses three specific issues which the Committee should certainly consider before the Recess. 
But they 
may like to start by making a general review of the situation, in both its political and military aspects, and hearing from Mr. Howard Smith and General Tuzo how they assess the current temperature. 2. 
In particular:(a) What are the prospects of Mr. Faulkner’s political survival? 
And, if he falls, when is he most likely to do so; and who is his most probable successor? (b) How confident can we be of reaching, and emerging from, 12th August 
without a catastrophe? Does the GOC need anything more in the way of help or reinforcements ? (c) Are we in Whitehall geared to cope with anything which may happen 
during the next fortnight? I have been thinking over your suggestion that you should put the Home Secretary formally in charge of the Government while you are away in the early part of August; and I believe that, in present circumstances, this would be wise. 
But it is particularly important that 
the period immediately before and after 12th August should be adequately ’covered" in terms of political authority in Whitehall; and I think that it would be psychologically valuable if you would check with the Home Secretary, at tomorrow’s meeting, that your respective intentions will ensure this. 3. 
Turning to the three specific issues discussed in NI(71) 7:- 
Apprentice Boys’ March on 12th August The decision here has political as well as security implications; in 
particular it will be an important element in any approach to be made to Mr. Lynch over internment in the South. 4.

23rd July 1971 Dear Prime Minister, 
My colleagues and I are considerably concerned about the continuing deterioration of the situation in the North. We take a serious view of the withdrawal of the Opposition from Stormont. Our examination of this matter suggests that the decision to withdraw, of which we had no advance information, while directly associated with the shootings in Derry a fortnight ago was more likely caused by a growing conviction among the Opposition that further efforts on their part to contribute to the normalisation of society in the North were fruitless in the face of the increasing signs of a restoration of old-style Unionist authority. While neither of us would wish to go into excessive detail in our correspondence I can understand the view taken by the Opposition to the degree that it appears to be justified by such matters as the following: 
(i) (ii) 
the composition of Mr. Faulkner’s Cabinet which includes so many hard-line and sectarian-minded members; 
the appointment of a minority representative to the Housing Executive who is believed to be in fact the nominee of Mr. John Taylor, Minister of State at the Ministry of Home Affairs; 
(iii) 
the apparent absence of serious intent to reduce substantially the large number of licensed weapons. This was discussed at Stormont last February and at Westminster last April. The matter is administered by Mr. Taylor who also had responsibility for the issue of licences for large quantities of guns and for gun clubs in the last two years and whose recent remarks give no cause for confidence in his intentions or his judgment; 
(iv) (v) 
the refusal of the Unionist Party to break their continuing association with the Orange Order; 
the visit of Mr. Faulkner and senior members of his Cabinet to Lurgan at the end of June to confer with leaders of the Orange Order on parades;

this afternoon. A 9 year old boy was killed when an army lorry skidded. A crowd formed and burnt lorry. However, local leaders managed to calm the crowd down and dispersed them after the Security Forces left the area. Also this afternoon some youths damaged an electricity 
transmitter which provides power for the Bogside. Consequently, there is no street lighting there this 
The province this evening is now all quiet with 
one exception, Lurgan, where a crowd formed and commandeered the bus depot which they had set alight and they destroyed four buses. Security forces moved in. So far four arrests have been made. It is raining in Northern Ireland and it is believed that this has a dampening effect upon any possible rioters.

(i) it is thought that at the next Stormont election Mr. Paisley will win around 16 seats; even if this does not enable him to form a Government, it will give him an important role in Stormont; there is 
therefore a case for

21st July 1971 We have been giving fresh consideration both to the 
operational tactics to be used by the Army in Northern Ireland, and to the force level required there, during the next few weeks in the light of two factors: the increased level of IRA terrorism during recent weeks, and the march of the Protestant Apprentice Boys which traditionally takes place in Londonderry on 12th August. The Prime Minister will wish to be aware of the conclusions which have been reached. 
As you know, although the main Protestant parades of July 
passed off without giving rise to any serious incidents, there has been a significant worsening in recent weeks in the amount and nature of terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, with frequent bomb attacks on an increasing scale and also the outbreaks of extremely vicious street fighting in Londonderry where there had previously been very little trouble for many months. This activity is clearly the work of the IRA; and the GOC has confirmed that the signs are that this body is getting better organised and more efficient in its methods. Earlier this week the GOC reported to the Defence Secretary, and also to the Home Secretary, that renewed pressure was building up within Mr. Faulkner’s Government for firm action against the IRA; and Mr. Faulkner has himself been in touch with the Home Secretary to suggest that the time may have come to think again about internment. 
It would be primarily a political decision whether to 
bring in internment, but it would depend very much on military advice. The view of the GOC, with which the Defence Secretary entirely agrees, is that the arguments against resorting to internment remain very strong and that other possibilities for disrupting the IRA should certainly be tried first. On this basis the GOC has proposed a new operational approach designed to make life as difficult as possible for those people who are known to be leading IRA activists and so to give them the minimum

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland The Home Secretary wanted you to know that he 
thinks that the political situation on the Northern Ireland front is showing modest signs of improvement. There have been three encouraging developments today: (i) Mr. Faulkner talked on the telephone to the Home Secretary this morning and told him how pleased h was with the results of the operation on Friday; he hoped there could be more of them; in general, however, he was fairly relaxed and as anxious to assure the Home Secretary that he was entirely at one with the way he was handling things. 
(ii) The meeting which the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary had with Conservative backbenchers this evening went rather better than had been expected; they seemed to think that the situation was better than it had looked last week; the main area in which they thought more could be done was in putting pressure on Mr. Lynch. 
(iii) The Ulster Unionist Council sent a telegram to the Home Secretary today dissociating themselves from the sentiments expressed by by Captain Orr. 
In the light of this the Home Secretary has been 
thinking about the suggestion, referred to in the attached letter, that the Lynch visit should be announced tomorrow. He is seeking Mr. Faulkner’s views and hopes to have them late tonight. 
In view of the apparent improvement

27 July, 1971 Prime Minister’s Meeting with Mr. Lynch As you know Mr. Lynch agreed to the dates (20 and 21 October 
proposed by the Prime Minister for their next meeting. Although we recognise it is not customary to announce 
visits of this sort so far in advance, references to this visit have already appeared publicly (some pointing confidently to October). 
In this particular case it has seemed to us sensible to make an announcement at an early stage. Otherwise 
there would always be the risk that disturbances during the marching season would provoke calls for an Anglo-Irish summit, leaving us with the choice of either staying silent and being accused of ignoring the problem, or making an announcement and being accused of panic reaction to events. We had hitherto been looking towards the latter half of August to make the announcement, which we understood was the period the Irish also preferred, but Parliamentary pressure in Dublin has led then today to ask whether the announcement could be made this Thursday, 29 July. 
to see the matter settled. 
Although this is horribly short notice, we would be happy We have pointed out to the Irish 
the risk that if we do now go ahead it could give renewed life to the current press interest in Mr. Lynch’s recent speech on reunification, and that therefore in background briefing to the press we might have to take the line that the talks would cover matters of interest to the two Governments but that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland would not be a matter for negotiation. 
was being kept informed. 
We would also make it plain that Mr. Faulkner Recognising all this the Irish say that
