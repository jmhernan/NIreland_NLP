7th June, 1972. PVC ROUND As you know, the rubber baton round, although very useful 
for dealing with hooligans and rioters in many circumstances, becomes increasingly ineffective at ranges over 35 metres; indeed hooligans have on occasions caught rubber bullets in Rioters can throw stones, bottles and small petrol 
flight. 
bombs effectively at 60 metres, and this difference in effective range is exploited regularly by hooligans, particularly in Londonderry, whose aim is often to draw troops forward to where they can be engaged by snipers. 
We have long been conscious of this deficiency in our 
armoury, and HQ Northern Ireland asked, last October, for the development of a baton round which would deliver the same punch at 80 metres as the present round at 35 metres. 
A plastic 
(PVC) round, with a 45 grain charge, has been developed by CDE Porton, and has proved to be significantly more accurate than the rubber round at all ranges. 
However, with the increase of capability over the rubber 
round at all ranges, there is a corresponding increase in the risk of causing serious injury or death at shorter ranges, and I accept that use of the PVC round must be subject to the strictest conditions and controls. 
Rules of engagement have 
therefore been agreed with HQ Northern Ireland as follows: a. 
which the current rubber round is ineffective; b. 
The round is only to be used in circumstances in Orders to fire the round are only to be given by an 
officer at the scene of the incident, who is to control the fire throughout the engagement; 
The round is to be fired only by selected soldiers, specifically trained and aware of its characteristics; 
c. The Rt. Hon. William Whitelaw, M.C. , M.P.

7 June 1972 
You wrote to me on 30 May about two Northern Ireland points which the Prime Minister has raised. 
As to a Bill of Rights, we are looking carefully at possible arrangements under which minority and other rights are guaranteed by the United Kingdom Parliament or by the constitution itself. Whether a Bill of Rights, as it is generally thought of, is the most effective guarantee is one of the questions we will have to consider. We are, in fact, at present faced with a Bill of Rights for which Lord Brockway has obtained the first reading in the House of Lords and which is likely to receive a second reading in the second half of June. This Bill is little more than a rather clumsily revised version of a Bill which Lord Brockway presented in 1971 and it will have to be opposed on the main ground that it is not helpful at this juncture to consider such matters piecemeal. This does not mean to say that someformal statutory guarantee, possibly analagous to a Bill of Rights, may not form a helpful part of the framework of a final settlement. 
As to the second point, the Prime Minister probably has in mind the McGilligan camp on the extreme North West point of Northern Ireland which was temporarily used to house internees when Long Kesh could hold no more. (It is a good many miles away from Londonderry - in one of the most remote spots in Northern Ireland.) But now that over one-third of the present internees have been released, it has been possible to bring to an end the use of McGilligan for this purpose. Instead, it is now being temporarily used as an overflow prison for short-term prisoners from Belfast because the prisons in Northern Ireland are over-crowded, a state of affairs which is under review. The Secretary of State was satisfied that there was no alternative course at present.

Note of a meeting held on 6 June 
INTELLIGENCE The overall level of Republican terrorist activity is much the same. 
There have been reports that the Provisionals are considering some form of temporary cease-fire which they will almost certainly attempt to link with their projected election in the Bogside and Creggan. The Ulster Defence Association appears not to have any great stock of arms, but members have mentioned the possibility of obtaining rifles held by members of the Ulster Defence Regiment. OPERATIONS 2. 
The parades at the week-end were handled satisfactorily. It is possible 
that Protestants will attempt to set up permanent barricades this week-end. The spread of this activity in towns outside Belfast and Londonderry creates difficulties for the security forces. ARREST POLICY 3. 
The arrest of eight men last night, four of whom were on a ’wanted’ list, 
raises the question in what circumstances such arrests should be made. Three of the men are thought to be senior officers of the Belfast Provisionals. The question is which people should be arrested and for what purposes; criminal charges, questioning under the Special Powers Act, or in rare cases detention or internment. The Northern Ireland Office will arrange for the subject to be considered by the Joint Security Committee in Northern Ireland. 4. 
The policy regarding leading notables in the IRA such as John Stephenson 
is that they should be arrested if that is possible without causing disproportionate disorder, even if no evidence of a criminal offence is available. The Northern Ireland ffice is considering further guidance on this problem, in particular dealing with the possibilities of extradition or transfer of persons arrested to the Republic and the attitude to be adopted

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 020700 TO 050700 JUN 72 GENERAL 1. 
The most significant events of another busy but mostly peaceful weekend were the two marches and rallies, one Protestant (6000) in 
Londonderry on Saturday coordinated by the UDA and addressed by CRAIG, the other Catholic (350) in Armagh on Sunday organised by Republican Clubs affiliated to the Official IRA and’addressod by McGOILLA. Both events were marred by minor hooliganism, but there were no serious casualties. Further Portestant temporary ’No Go’ areas wore established on Saturday/ Sunday in Portadown Ballymena, Londonderry and Coagh, Co Tyrone but not in Belfast. Security Forces traffic was not impeded. On Friday two soldiers of 4 Fd Regt were killed near Rossela in a border mine incident. On Saturday night a car bomb exploded without warning outside a Catholic owned pub on the fringes of Ballymacarrett, causing 49 minor casualties only 4 of whom are still in hospital. In the Republic the Provisionals have announced the temporary appointment of David O’CONNEL as President on place of Rory O’BRADY pending the latter’s release. There was a demonstration at the Curragh by 200 people (mostly from NI) against the detention of Republicans. In London there was reportedly a Provisional march to Whitehall by several hundred supporters and Mrs DRUMM spoke outside the MOD. The GB weekend press was mostly devoted to the prospects for peace. 
2. During FRI/SAT 2/3 JUN. There were 32 shooting incidents and six 
explosions. 29 of the shooting incidents were in Belfast but the only casualty was a RC youth who was injured in an incident which did not involve the Security Forces .

3. During SAT/SUN 3/4 JUN. There were 19 shooting incidents and 2 explosions all of which took place in Belfast. In one of these explosions in the Catholic area of Est Belfast 49 people received minor injuries. One Catholic man was found shot dead in the New Lodge area and a gunman is thought to have been hit in the Ardoyne. The UDA march and rally in the Waterside area of Londonderry passed off with only minr hooliganism. 
4. During SUN/MON 4/5 JUN. There were 18 shooting incidents in which the Security Forces wore involved in 12. There were two explosions. There was one minor UDR casualty, one hit was claimed on a gunman in Belfast, and five civilians were wounded.

COPY NO. 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 25 MAY 1972 
- 1 JUNE 1972 Memorandum by the Northern Ireland Office 1. Though the violence continues in Northern Ireland (there appear to be 
some grounds for cautious optimism) the Official IRA have offered a ceasefire and there are signs that the Catholic population are not only tired of violence but prepared to take some action to bring about peace. 
2. The Government in the Republic seems ready to take tougher measures 
against the IRA. A Special Court, sitting without a jury, has been set up, while leading members of the IRA have been arrested, charged and remanded in custody. 
THE REPUBLIC 3. 
The Prisons Bill which authorises the Minister for Justice to transfer 
certain prisoners into military custody was passed in Dublin on Thursday as a result of the riots at Mountjoy. It is thought that one of the effects could be the transfer of other Republican prisoners into military custody in line with the vie expressed by Mr. O’Maley that security of Republican prisoners and rehabilitation of ordinary prisoners are incompatible. 
4. The establishment of a Special Criminal Court was set up during the week. 
It will consist of three udges whose names have been announced) sitting without a jury. Charges pending against about 40 Republicans are expected to be referred to the court. 
5. Joe Cahill and Rory and Sean O’Brady have been arrested and detained 
under the Offences Against The State Act. This appears to be part of a new drive against the Provisional wing of the IRA. 
THE IRA 6. 
The Official IRA, in a statement on Monday said that it was suspending 
operations in Northern Ireland because of the growing danger of sectarian conflict. This move was rejected by Sean MacStiofain, one of the Provisional IRA leaders, who stated that their campaign would continue. As the Provisionals have been responsible for the majority of incidents of violence, it is not expected that the level will drop significantly.

There were approximately 20 vigilantes in the estate. Some of them thought that the presence of the patrols was a "breach of the ceasefire". They later agreed that they had been mistaken and stated that there will be no hostile reaction to military patrols, but the RUC are not expected to patrol the area. 
(2) Ballymurpy. The only reaction was when the local IRA leader, approached the Company Commander and stated that the military presence was a breach of the truce.

29 June 1972 
D J Trevelyan Esq Northern Ireland Office 
Guardian on Irish representation in talks on the future of Northern Ireland. 
2. 
We spoke about the Simon Winchester story in to-day’s I enclose the text of the actual Question 
and Answer, dictated to me by phone from the Embassy in Dublin, who were quoting from the report in the Irish Times. 
I suggest that, in answer to Parliamentary Questions on this point, we might say: 
"Mr Lynch was asked whether the Republic of Ireland would be represented at discussions between the British Government and political representatives of Northern Ireland. 
He replied by stating that 
his Government were in continuing contact with the British Government in relation to the whole question of Northern Ireland. 
"Mr Lynch was also asked whether there had been agreement with HMG that the Irish Government would be represented at talks. 
He replied that there 
had been no formal agreement. "Both these statements are correct. 
The communique 
issued on 28 September stated that ’Mr Heath and Mr Lynch agreed to keep in close communication with each other, personally, through their Ministerial colleagues and at official level, as might be appropriate, on all subjects affecting the future of Anglo-Irish relations’, 
That remains the situation. The House will not expect me to 
comment on speculative pres stories, save to remark that there is a very real distinction between two Prime Minister’s agreeing to keep in close touch and the admission of another Government as of right to a place at any Conference to settle the affairs of part of the United Kingdom." 
3. 
general line of "recognising Lynch’s legitimate concern with the welfare of the Catholic minority..... therefore we remain in continuing contact 
I understand that, at the lobby this morning, this ..... " was followed.

28 June 
ARREST POLICY The policy to be followed oh the making of arrests was worked out and 
agreed with the security forces on Monday. The emphasis is on arresting people only if they are wanted in connection with criminal offences but Regulation 11 (1) under the Special Powers Act may be used in certain circumstances. The instructions to members of the security forces on the policy to be adopted will be given orally. OPERATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE 2. 
The violence up to midnight on Monday was presumably designed to show 
that the Provisionals were not calling a truce out of weakness. Since then the violence, especially explosions, has lessened. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is seeing representatives of the Ulster Defence Association today. PUBLIC RELATIONS 3. 
Press reports have already attempted to show that members of the security 
forces are depressed about the truce and what is portrayed as their inability to retaliate against violence. 4. 
The Ministry of Defence and Northern Ireland Office will liaise on the 
line to be taken in reply to these suggestions, and, in particular, the possibility of stimulating an article setting out the contribution which the security forces have made towards the bringing about of a truce. 5. 
The Ministry of Defence will consider what might be done within the Army 
to make sure it is known that the Army’s efforts are appreciated and that present policies are understood: the recent message from the Commander Land Forces has already addressed itself to this problem.

At tomorrow’s meeting you will no doubt wish to ask:- 
(a) The Vice Chief of the General Staff to report on the security situation following the "ceasefire" by the IRA. 
2. 
(b) The Secretary of State to assess the developing political situation. The following questions may be relevant:- 
(i) Is the "ceasefire" being effectively observed by the IRA? Are the 
sporadic shooting and bombing incidents thought to originate from other sources or to be the result of inadequate control by the Provisional leaders? (ii) What policy are the security forces observing as regards the general In particular, what are their instructions regarding 
level of their activity? 
the arrest of wanted men? And what is the position in the Bogside and Creggan? (iii) What is the risk that the UDA will erect barricades or proclaim 
"no-go" areas in Protestant districts over the coming weekend? (iv) Are there any indications of a Protestant "backlash" otherwise than 
from the UDA? What is Mr. Faulkner’s current position? (v) What has the Secretary of State in mind as regards the release of 
internees in the coming weeks? (vi) Is it yet possible to assess the prospects for- and the timing of 
the projected constitutional conference? In particular, are there any indications that the IRA will insist on direct representation, under threat of renewing their campaign of violence if their demand is not met? And how do we stand with Mr. Lynch in this context? (vii) Has the Secretary of State yet been able to form a definite view about 
the timing of a Border plebiscite in relation to the conference? (viii) Separately (arising from the discussion at the last meeting) when can 
we expect the completion of the investigations into allegations of brutality by the RUC?

1. Violence has continued unabated except in Londonderry where it was relatively quiet During the period there were 173 shooting incidents, 82 of them involving 
the Security Forces. The great majority were in BELFAST, particularly in ANDERSONSTOWN, where IRA tactics were reported to be 
and 16 hits in all 
against gunmen were claimed without Security Force casualties. The main weight of explosions was in the rural areas, and the targets were widely scattered. Near DUNGIVEN, in the early hours of Saturday morning, 3 soldiers were killed and 2 VSI as a result of a mining incident for which the Provisionals later claimed responsibility. On the border there were a variety of minor incidents. Armed robberies totalled 27, a noticeable increase. All in all, it seems reasonable to conclude that the Provisionals are anxious to emphasie the expected contrast pre and post cease fire. Elsewhere, GB weekend press comment concentrated on the steps leading up to the cease fire proposal, and prospects for its observance. In the USA, a federal grand jury is reported to be investigating charges of gun. running to the IRA.

soldiers and a civilian were seriously wounded in an incident when a landrover was mined near Dungiven, Co Londonderry. A report is at Annex A.

CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS The situation generally will depend on reactions to the cease-fire. 
Instructions have been issued to the Army for the period up to midnight on Monday. Fresh instructions for the period thereafter are still being considered. In particular the Northern Ireland Office is considering an instruction on arrest policy which might be capable of being given in answer to a Parliamentary Question if necessary. At the moment the ’wanted’ list does not distinguish between people wanted in connection with particular offences and people just under general suspicion, but such a distinction can be made. 
2. It would be unwise to attempt to publicise precisely which men might be 
liable to be arrested. The IRA might claim this was in breach of the cease-fire, and the U.D.A. might assume that all other people were to go free. A specific statement of policy might upset the delicate situation that we are in at present. 
3. It is possible that some elements will attempt to carry on the violence 
(although the Provisionals will probably wish to see to it that their wishes are carried out). The possibility of setting up local liaison committees, composed of military, police and civilian representatives, is being considered. Such committees could establish communications with the local areas and help to prevent misunderstandings. 
4. The battalion recently sent to Northern Ireland is staying there for the time 
being. The July marches are approaching, and it is too soon to say what pattern will emerge following the cease-fire.

TO IMMEDIATE FCO TELNO 445 OF 23 JUNE AND TO UKREP BELFAST. IRA TRUCE 
- PRESS REACTIONS. 
1. DUBLIN PRESS REACTIONS TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE IRA TRUCE REFLECT PUBLIC RELIEF AT THE PROSPECT OF A CESSATION OF VIOLENCE, BUT THERE IS A MARKED DIFFERENCE IN EDITORIAL APPROACH. IN A THINLY DISGUISED INTERVIW WITH SEAMUS TWOMEY, THE BELFAST PROVISIONAL LEADER, VINCENT BROWNE CLAIMS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE IRISH PRESS THAT IT IS CLEAR THAT THE IRA HAS EVERY INTENTION OF RESUMING THE CAMPAIGN WITH RENEWED FEROCITY WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME - A MONTH OR TWO MONTHS IS THE TIME-SCALE MENTIONED (PRESUMABLY BY TWOMEY) IF CERTAIN CONCESSIONS ARE NOT MADE BY THE WHITELAW ADMINISTRATION. BROWNE GOES ON TO CLAIM THAT THE CONCESSIONS INCLUDE A DECLARATION OF INTENT BY THE BRITISH GVERNMENT TO ’’STOP INTERFERING IN IRISH AFFAIRS AND LEAVE THE WAY OPEN TO ALL-IRELAND ELECTIONS’’. THE CEASEFIRE PERIOD WOULD BE USED FOR LARGESCALE RETRAINING AND RE-EQUIPPING IN PREPARATION FOR A RESUMTION OF THE CAMPAIGN, SHOULD IT BE NECESSARY. 
2. THE IRISH PRESS EDITORIAL REFLECTS THE PROVISIONAL LINE TAKEN BY BROWNE ON THE FRONT PACE. REFERRING TO THE NEED FOR PARTICIPATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND AFFAIRS BY THE MINORITY, THE EDITORIAL EMPHASIZES THAT THIS PARTICIPATION MUST BE SHARED BY ’’THE MORE ADVANCED REPUBLICANS OF ALL SHADES OF STRATEGIES’’. THE EDITORIAL THEN CLAIMS THAT THE FORMULA FOR A LASTING PEACE MUST BE THAT WHICH THE IRISH PRESS HAS BEEN ARGUING, IT CLAIMS, FOR THE PAST YEAR, I.E. THE PUBLICISED DEMANDS OF THE PROVISIONAL IRA. 
3. THE IRISH INDEPENDENT EDITORIAL NOTES THE PROVISIONAL CEASEFIRE IS WITHOUT TIME LIMIT. AVOIDiNG ALL RECRIMINATION, THE EDITORIAL GOES ON TO APPLAUD THE GOOD SENSE ON BOTH SIDES THAT BROUGHT ABOUT THE TRUCE OFFER AND PAYS TRIBUTE TO THE REALISM OF MR WHITELAW’S POLICIES. IT WARNS AFAINST A FACILE APPROACH By

23 June 1972 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 16 June 1972 
- 22 June 1972 
1. Although the week has been violent it has ended in the Provisional IRA’s declaration of a cease-fire from midnight on 26 June. The reaction from the various political parties in Northern Ireland has been cautious: most are waiting to see what further steps are taken following the ceasefire. 
MR WHITELAW 
2. Mr Whitelaw, in a television broadcast on 16 June, called on the people of Northern Ireland to help him create a real and lasting peace and to draw back from the danger of sectarian confluct. He repeated his pledge that the Border would not be changed without their consent, and stressed that there would have to be an end soon to the campaign of civil disobedience. There would also have to be an end to the no-go areas. Independent areas would not be permitted to offer shelter for those who planned death and destruction to the innocent. 
THE HUNGER STRIKE 
3. A number of prisoners in Crumlin Road have been on hunger strike, demanding political status. It was announced on Monday that some prisoners would be moved to Long Kesh. This would make separate accommodation available at Crumlin Road, for those serving sentences for certain offences. The men involved later called off the hunger strike. 
THE PROVISIONAL IRA 
4. Reports appearing at the weekend that Sean MacStiofain had been replaced by David O’Connell as leader of the Provisionals were denied by the movement. 
5. On 22 June, the leaders of the Provisional IRA issued a statement as follows:- 
"The Irish Republican Army will suspend offensive operations as and from midnight Monday, June 26, provided that a public reciprocal response is forthcoming from the Armed Forces of the British Crown.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND SDLP REPRESENTATIVES (MR HUME AND MR DEVLIN) AT STORMONT CASTLE AT 12 30 PM ON MONDAY, 19 JUNE 
The Secretary of State said that he had now arranged for the proposed meeting with representatives of the Provisionals to take place at the house of Colonel M W McCorkell. As requested by the Provisionals, it would be on Tuesday, 20 June, at a time to be agreed. He had decided that he should be represented by a senior official and one other official. This would avoid difficulties and delays in briefing an outside emissary. The senior representative would be Mr P J Woodfield, Deputy Under Secretary of State, who would be fully empowered to state the Secretary of State’s position but not to enter into negotiations. He would arrange for Mr Gerald Adams to be released from detention (not internment). On the question of harassment, it might be necessary to ask the Provisionals to ensure that certain named individuals were not seen in Northern Ireland. This would avoid the difficulty that knowledge of the arrangements being made had to be carefully limited to as small a number of persons as possible. He hoped it would be possible to make early arrangements to accommodate the "political" prisoners separately and to allow them to wear their own clothes. This would take a little while. Meanwhile the question arose of the timing of a statement. If the concession were granted in advance of the meeting with the Provisionals they might make further demands. 
The SDLP representatives said that it would be helpful if the announcement could be made in advance. It could be presented as a step towards the lowering of tension in the prison. They were confident that the Provisionals would not seek to make further demands. If the Secretary of State agreed to the proposition in respect of harassment, details of which would be given at the meeting, and in respect of the treatment of the prisoners, the Provisionals would further ask only that he should agree to meet them at a further meeting. The Provisionals attached considerable importance to this. The SDLP representatives were confident that the Provisionals would stick to the bargain, although the situation would be complicated by the reaction of the Officials and the UDA. There remained some elements who would be determined to ensure that the peace initiatives did not succeed. The question of enforcement of the cease fire might be discussed at the meeting with the Provisionals.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND SDLP REPRESENTATIVES (MR HUME AND MR DEVLIN) AT THE OFFICE OF THE UK REPRESENTATIVE AT 12 20 PM ON SUNDAY, 18 JUNE 1972 
Mr Hume said that he and Mr Devlin had discussed with MacStiofain and O’Connell the possibility of an immediate cease fire. In response MacStiofain and O’Connell had asked that the Secretary of State should meet O’Connell and Gerald Adams, at present interned, on neutral ground. The Provisionals’ delegates intended to propose to the Secretary of State that he should give an assurance that there would be no harassment by the security forces (by which he appeared to mean no "lifting" for offences committed up to the date of the cease fire) and that there should be recognition of the demands of the "political" prisoners. In return the Provisionals would publicly declare an immediate and indefinite cease fire. The SDLP representatives said that they found it difficult to believe the rumours of a split in the ranks of the Provisionals. O’Connell himself had said that it was not true. Both O’Connell and MacStiofain were fully committed to the proposed meeting and the Provisionals’ delegates would be fully empowered to reach agreement. For all their terrorist activities, such an agreement would be honoured by the Provisionals. But the SDLP representatives urged the Secretary of State to respond quickly to the invitation; any delay would give MacStiofain and other extremists a chance to break away and re-assert their dominance. There was, say, a 10 per cent risk that the meeting would become public knowledge before it took place. If it subsequently became public knowledge the cease fire would already have been declared. In any event the risk was worth taking. They had consulted the Provisionals about the possibility of an intermediary attending a meeting on behalf of the Secretary of State, but this had been rejected. 
The Secretary of State said that he had to preserve the position of the SDLP as the elected representatives of the people. Any discussions would therefore have to be conducted under their "banner"; the position of the SDLP would otherwise be undermined. There should be no difficulty in reaching agreement about "harassment". It would not be possible to give prisoners "political" status, but they could be accommodated in a separate compound and they could probably be allowed to wear their own clothes and perhaps to receive additional letters and

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND MR HUME AND MR DEVLIN AT 4.30 PM ON THURSDAY 15 JUNE IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE’S OFFICE, GREAT GEORGE STREET. 
The Secretary of State said that he had just announced in the House of Commons that the local elections in the autumn would be on the basis of proportional representation and that he would be undertaking talks about talks on the political institutions of Northern Ireland. 
Mr Hume said that he had thought that events over the last week were taking a serious turn,but during the let day or so a real oppoatunity for a lasting peace had emerged. The SDLP had publicly welcomed the UDA announcement. Despite the terms in which the Provisionals had couched their invitation to talk,it representedamajor advance and an opportunity for peace that should not be missed. The peace initiatives in Londonderry and Belfast were beginning to have a real effect. But the people in those areas were not interested in the niceties of conditions; they saw the Provisionals’ statement as an opportunity for peace and the Secretary of State’s reply as something of a rebuff. 
Mr Devlin said that there would have to be talks with the Provisionals at some stage. The Secretary of State had already talked with the UDA many of whom had expressed themselves in violent terms, and some had actually used violence. If the Secretary of State were prepared to begin talks the way would be open for the removal of barricades and some form of policing in the existing "no go" areas. The Provisionals were the key to the situation; the Secretary of State now had the opportunity to give a real impetus to the moves for peace. 
The Secretary of State said that he had replied quickly to the Provisionals’ statement on Monday, because in particular it had been in the form of an ultimatum. He had to be especially careful not to undermine the position of the elected representatives of the people such as Mr Hume and Mr Devlin. It was equally essential that they should do nothing to undermine his position. Moreover, many of the Provisionals were wanted men with whom it would have been impossible to negotiate. He was also subject to other pressures. He had found the UDA to be angry and frustrated, but also frightened of their own power. The

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UDA AND MR BILLY HULL AT 3 15 PM ON 13 JUNE 1972 IN STORMONT CASTLE 
Present: 
The Secretary of State Mr Billy Hull, Chairman of LAW Mr Parsons, UDA Mr Herron, UDA Mr Steele Mr McDowall 
The Secretary of State said that he was aware from Bishop Butler that the UDA wished to see him and he had noted the points they had already put forward. 
The delegation said that they wished to represent the strong feelings of the Protestant community. They had shown infinite patience in the face of continuing violence and frustration, particularly in respect of the ’no go’ areas in Londonderry and the civil disobedience campaign. They accepted that it was undesirable to invade the ’no go’ areas but felt that other positive means should be used to bring them to an early end. One possibility would be to put a barricade around the ’no go’ areas; another would be to suspend social security benefits. The patience of the Protestant community was coming to an end. The Secretary of State had repeatedly made concessions to the minority by tolerating the ’no go’ areas, releasing internees and taking no positive action to end the civil disobedience campaign. If there was no concrete response to the problems of the majority they would be forced to act. In these circumstances the UDA would act as a moderating influence by channelling their energies into the establishment of permanent barricades in Belfast. 
The Secretary of State said that he wished to make it clear for the avoidance of any doubt that the additional Battalion being sent to Northern Ireland was solely for the purpose of protecting law-abiding citizens and defeating the terrorists. There was no truth whatever in the rumour that they would be used to deal with the UDA barricades. He understood the feelings of frustration which had been expressed and appreciated the reasonable and responsible attitude adopted by the delegation. He shared the general view of the urgent need to end the violence. But one result of the action proposed by the UDA to erect permanent barricades in Belfast would be to give an excuse to the

Note of meeting on 16th June 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS The political and security situations have changed markedly in the last few days. Although the UDA were concerned at the rate of release of internees, they have following the meeting with Mr Whitelaw 
barracades for 14 days, and to prevent the Tartan gangs from creating disorder. 2. Firm rejection of the ultimatum from the IRA provisionals has reassured the majority community. The SDLP are having talks with Mr Whitelaw, leaving the IRA provisionals in political isolation. Whether the provisionals will stop their campaign of violence, or resort to even more desperate measures, is impossible to foretell. The SDLP have chosen Messrs Hume and Devlin as their representatives. Mr Fitt is being seen separately. 
3. The Government is launching a political initiative with 2 main points. Local Government elections later this year will be held under a system of proportional representation, using the single transferable vote; and the Government are to have talks with interested parties with a view to holding a round-table conference on the political future of Northern Ireland. The initiative has been well received. A critical question is the extent to which the views of either wing of the IRA should be expressed at an eventual conference. There can certainly be no direct dealing with the provisional IRA while violence continues, but history suggests that the United Kingdom Government has, in the context of other political settlements, had some contact with those who have participated in extremist activities. A close study is being made of examples. 
4. The attitude of the Government of the Republic of Ireland to events in the North, and to developments at Westminster, continues to be of great importance. They have been told that as matters stand the IRA cannot be admitted to any round-table 
- decided to defer the erection of permanent

NOTE OF A MEETING WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROVISIONAL IRA 
On the intructions of the Secretary of State I met representatives of the Provisional IRA at 3 pm on Tuesday, 20 June. The meeting took place at Ballyarnett, a house near the Donegal border owned by Colonel M W McCorkell. The Colonel and Mrs McCorkell were in the house at the time. 
2. The IRA representatives were Mr David O’Connell and 
Mr Gerard Adams. I was accompanied by Mr Frank Steele. 3. 
Before the discussions proper started I was introduced to 
a third person, Mr P J McGrory who was described as a solicitor and a wholly independent person. It had been arranged that I should carry with me a note signed by the Secretary of State to say that I was an authorised representative. This note is in the following terms: 
"The bearer of this note, Mr P J Woodfield, is a senior official in my Department. He has full authority to explain my position on the three points which have been put to me. 
He is being accompanied by Mr Steele, another official in my Department. 
(signed) William Whitelaw Secretary of State for Northern Ireland" 
Mr McGrory’s function appeared to be to scrutinise this note and by virtue of his legal powers he pronounced it authentic and then withdrew. 
4. We began the meeting with a statement from me outlining the 
position of the Provisional IRA as reported to the Secretary of State which was as follows: 
The IRA were prepared to call an indefinite cease fire if they could be satisfied that the Secretary of State would accept the demand of certain convicted prisoners for "political status"; that he would immediately order the cessation of all harassment of the IRA; and that he would be prepared after the cease fire had been shown to be effective to meet representatives of the Provisional IRA.

bar were both blown up in Belfast and the Bligh’s Lane post in Derry had another gunbattle on Saturday. Interest has again centred on the political front with 
the Dublin inspired report that Stephenson had been replaced as Provisional Chief of Staff by David O’Connell. This was subsequently denied. There has been wore speculation about a Provisional ceasefire and Bernadette Devlin has joined the ranks of those calling for a end to violence. Meanwhile a possible source of a violent confrontation petered out when the Northern Resistance Movement march from the Falls through Belfast City Centre to the Crumlin gaol in support of the Hunger Strikers attracted only 800 and was stopped and dispersed by Security Forces without trouble

GEN 79 There are three main subjects for discussion at tomorrow’s 
meeting of GEN 79: first the customary review of the security situation; second, the Attorney General’s memorandum on the Administration of Justice (GEN 79(72) 8); and, third, the Directive on Interrogation recently approved by the Joint Intelligence Committee. 2. 
As regards the security situation Ministers will no doubt wish, 
after hearing the usual reports from the Chief of the General Staff, to consider the problem of increasing militancy within the Protestant community, particularly the activities of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). As Mr. Whitelaw told the Cabinet this morning, his recent discussions with UDA leaders have gained time; but, if the UDA set up permanent barricades, the Government would be placed in a very difficult position. As you said at the last meeting of GEN 79, while the Bogside and Creggan can be represented as special cases, to permit the establishment of new "no go" areas would be difficult to reconcile with a professed policy of re-imposing the rule of law witin the Province. Ministers should be informed about the steps which the security forces would propose in this contingency; but the potential political implications emphasise the importance of prevention rather than cure. The Secretary of State might be asked whether there are yet any indications of the effect on both communities of the announcement of PR in local elections and of our intention to hold preliminary discussions regarding a Round Table Conference. What impressions did he derive from his meeting with Mr. Hume and Mr. Paddy Devlin this afternoon? And how have the Protestants reacted? An equally important factor in persuading them not to escalate their campaign may be our policy towards the Bogside and Creggan areas of Londonderry. 
Ministers will no doubt continue to judge 
that a major military operation, involving numerous civilian casualties, would be likely to undo all the political progress that Mr. Whitelaw has achieved; but it was recognised in Cabinet this morning that action to seal off the Bogside and Creggan areas might inthe worst case become necessary. 
There has been recent discussion within the security forces

NORTHERN IRELAND: ACT OF INDEMNITY Note by Officials 
Precedents of Acts of Indemnity 1. 
The earlier precedents do not help since they relate to an obsolete 
method of dealing with disturbances, ie by an enactment suspending the application of the Habeas Corpus Acts to those suspected of treasonable practices (to allow arbitrary detention) followed at the expiry of the suspension by an Act or Indemnity for acts done under cover of the suspension. 
The modern practice is to take wide powers (as in the N I 
Special Powers Acts and Regulations) to enable the executive to detain and take other steps to restore order. 
As long as soldiers and officials 
act within such powers they require no indemnity because the jurisdiction of the courts is effectively excluded. 
The question of indemnity only 
arises when even the wide powers so conferred are exceeded, eg by the use of excessive force or failure to comply with legal requirements as to arrest. 
The only UK Acts of Indemnity enacted in recent times are the 
Indemnity Act 1920 and the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923. 
2. in Northern Ireland. 
The 1923 Act has only a superficial relevance to the present situation It did not deal with the "troubles" in Southern 
Ireland and, in particular, with the acts there of the military under General Macready which were the subject of much litigation in the Irish courts until operations ceased with the 1922 Treaty. 
was passed in relation to those operations. 3. 
No Act of Indemnity The 1923 Act had a strictly limited purpose. The Home Secretary 
(Mr Bridgeman) had continued, for a short period after Southern Ireland had become the Irish Free State, to issue orders under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations for the arrest of persons in England and their internment in Dublin (which involved their deportation). 
The 
Court of Appeal in the Art O’Brien case declared such orders invalid, and the Irish Free State Government acceded to the Home Secretary’s request to make O’Brien available for release in England. 
The objects of the 
1923 Act were to relieve the Home Secretary from possible liability for the (unpardonable) praemunire offences under the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 which he had arguably committed by sending British subjects in custody out of the country without powers, and to avoid the embarrassment of further applications in the English courts by those who had been the subject of

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 130700 TO 140700 JUNE 1972 GENERAL 
1. There were 31 shooting incidents of which 18 involved the Security Forces. There were 4 
near Crossmaglen. John Stephenson, Provisional IRA, held a press conference in the Bogside area of Londonderry at which he offered a "truce" if Mr Whitelaw would hold talks with the Provisional IRA. The offer has been rejected. 
BELFAST 
2. There were 20 shooting incidents of which nine involved the Security Forces. Between 1245 and 1315hrs there was a coordinated series of bus and lorry hi-jackings following a rumour that McKee, on hunger strike in Crumlin Road Jail, had died. 
a. Lndersonstown. There were four shooting incidents in two of which the Security Forces came under fire. at 1345hrs in Finaghy a 10-201b bomb exploded in a grocery warehouse which caused extensive superficial damage but no casualties. 
b. Ballymurphy. There were three shooting incidents two of which involved the Security Forces. In one of them at St Thomas’s School a 12 year old girl was wounded by a sniper when a party of soldiers clearing barricades were fired on. Fire was returned but after the girl was hit. Buses were burnt in Whiterock and Falls Road 
c. Ardoyne. Security Forces were involved in one of the five shooting incidents. 
d. New Lodge. There were no shooting incidents. A lorry was set on fire in North Queen Street after it had been hi-jacked in Victoria St. 600 people including some ex-internees attended a New Lodge Resistance Council Meeting. 
e. Falls. Security Forces were involved in three of the five shooting incidents. One hit on a gunman was claimed when troops returned fire in Grosvener Rd. 
f. City Centre and South Belfast. There was one shooting incident. Catholic barricades were erected in the Markets area.

14th June 1972 In your letter of 6th June to Robert Andrew you mentioned 
the Prime Minister’s hope that action would be taken to refute press reports that a high proportion of those so far released from internment had returned to terrorist activity. 
When the Daily Express article to this effect appeared 
on 2nd June, we at once checked with Headquarters Northern Ireland exactly what was known on the point. The answer was that there were reports of varying reliability that up to 25 (of 380 or so who had been released by them) had returned to more or less active membership of the IRA - 
which did not 
necessarily mean that they had themselves become active terrorists again. This is obviously a very much smaller proportion than the one-quarter alleged by the Daily Express. 
HQNI confirmed 
that none of their officers had given any figures on the subject to the Express (which did not actually attribute this one-quarter theory to a military spokesman). 
You will be aware that Mr. Whitelaw made some references to 
this point in answering Questions on 8th June (Hansard, Cols. 678-9) and during the Debate on 12th June (Col. 1077). We consider that these references are a sufficient refutation of the press reports, and that any further more direct action might well be counter-productive. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Platt. Nevertheless, we shall use 
any opportunity which presents itself to correct the mistaken impression in these reports. 
(R.A. CUSTIS) The Lord Bridges.

Northern Ireland (CP(72) 59 and CP(72) 60) In these two memoranda the Secretary of State seeks agreement to 
the immediate announcement of decisions to introduce Proportional Representation (PR) for the local government elections in Northern Ireland this autumn and to enter upon preparatory discussions with a view to a Round Table Conference on the future of Northern Ireland. These two measures represent a substantial political initiative; and the Secretary of State regards them as important in order not only to maintain the momentum of the Government’s policies but also to promote a relaxation of tension within the Province. 2. 
Before agreeing to their immediate announcement, however, the 
Cabinet may wish:(a) 
(b) 
to consider a number of questions in respect of each measure, some of which are indicated in the attached notes; 
to ask the Secretary of State whether he sees the timing of this new initiative as affected either by his discussions yesterday with leaders of the UDA or by the approach from the "Provisional" wing of the IRA, which he inevitably rejected; 
(c) 
to consider the method and timing of the necessary exchanges with the Government’s supporters and the Opposition at Westminster and with the Government of the Republic in Dublin. Ideally, all these approaches 
- not least that to Mr. Lynch - should precede, 
however briefly, the Secretary of State’s Parliamentary statement. Will there be time? 
(d) 
to be assured that the Lord President sees his way to accommodate, somehow or other, the additional Parliamentary business which will result from a decision to introduce PR. 
3. The Secretary of State should be able to hand round the text of the 
statement which he hopes to make in the House of Commons in the afternoon. (In the absence of the Lord Privy Seal, who should make the corresponding statement in the Lords ?) For the reasons indicated in the attached notes, the Cabinet will need to consider the balance and the wording of this statement with particular care.

Local Government Reform and Proportional Representation (CP(72) 60) 
The Secretary of State explains the pressures which have led him 
to change his mind and to come round to the view that PR must be reintroduced if the local government elections are to be held and the reformed structure of local government is to be introduced as planned. He goes on to suggest that the most suitable form of PR is the single transferable vote and to explain that, for the reasons given in Annex B, this requires multimember constituencies. The need to define these constituencies (even taking as a basis the work already done on local government boundaries, as described in Annex C) accentuates the problems of timing, which call not only for an early decision and announcement but also for the application of the procedure of Order in Council by Affirmative Resolution (which is in any event proper while the Stormont Parliament stands prorogued). At the last meeting of GEN 79, however, it was felt that the Cabinet would wish to have assessments of:(i) the reaction to the reintroduction of PR on the part of Unionist elements in Northern Ireland and of Conservative and Ulster Unionist members at Westminster (bearing in mind the risk of repercussions on local - and, possibly, national - elections in Great Britain); 
2. 
(ii) the attitude of the Opposition at Westminster to the use of the Order in Council procedure for a measure of this kind. You may therefore wish to ask the Secretary of State, the Lord 
President and the Chief Whip, to indicate the results of their further consideration of these points; and to invite the Secretary of State to say whether any other steps would be desirable in order to secure the acquiescence of the Protestants in Northern Ireland. PR is bound to be unwelcome to them in principle; and its presentation, in the Parliamentary statement envisaged for tomorrow afternoon, will therefore be particularly important. It is to appear as part of a package in which the other main element will be the proposed Round Table Conference. It is all the more desirable, therefore, that the latter should not also seem to be biassed against the Protestants; and the Cabinet will presumably have taken this point in their discussion of the terms of reference of the Conference.

Note of a meeting on 13 June 
INTELLIGENCE The Provisionals have kept up the level of violence, thus increasing 
the tension in Belfast. They are presumably confident that the referendum they are at present conducting in Londonderry will enable them to show they still have popular support. The question which people are being asked is so drafted and presented that it is difficult to imagine many negative replies being given. The Northern Ireland Office will liaise with other departments on how the result of the referendum should be handled from the public relations point of view. ’NO-GO’AREAS 2. 
The attitude to be adopted by the security forces to attempts by Protestants 
to establish so-called "no-go" areas will depend on what sort of measures the Protestants take, e.g. whether they try to deny the security forces or fire or ambulance services access to any areas. It would not be desirable for the security forces to be pushed into violent confrontations with the Protestant community unnecessarily. If the Protestants attempt to put it about that they have created "no-go" areas, but in fact, for example, they are not interfering with the movements of the security forces, considerable effort would be required on the public relations side to show why Protestant "barricades" were not being dismantled by force. 3. 
The whole question of how any Protestant attempts to put up barricades should be 
handled and what the security forces should do in given situations is being considered through the Joint Security Committee in Northern Ireland. Individual departments will make sure that all relevant points are known to those taking part in the meetings in Northern Ireland. In addition, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is seeing representatives of the U.D.A. and possibly Mr. Craig.

Northern Ireland Just two supplementary thoughts about this afternoon’s meeting of 
GEN 79. 1. 
Proportional Representation (GEN 79(72) 9) The Secretary of State may be right to suggest that we should now 
reverse our earlier provisional decision and adopt PR for the forthcoming local elections in Northern Ireland. If so, however, Ministers should consider how and when the necessary announcement would best be made. There seems to be some suggestion that the decision might be announced during this evening’s debate on Northern Ireland affairs. 
But, quite apart 
from the argument that the Cabinet should first be given an opportunity to consider the matter, it is surely arguable that the announcement should also be related, in terms of timing, to the projected announcement of a Round Table Conference. The decision on PR will presumably be welcome to the Roman Catholics. But it will not be at all welcome to the Protestants; nor can there be any certainty that, in the eventual outcome, it will in fact make any significant contribution to the "depolarisation" of politics in the Province. Would it not best be presented, therefore, not in isolation but in the context of the major initiative which the Secretary of State is contemplating in the hope of making a positive step towards the ultimate solution? That initiative itself will not necessarily look very attractive to the various interests concerned; but it is arguable thatthe more it appears to contain something for everybodythe less unhopeful it will be 2. 
A Round Table Conference (GEN 79(72) 10) There can be no doubt of the need for an early political initiative; 
and the Secretary of State may well be right in recommending that, subject to the approval of the Cabinet, the necessary announcement should be made as soon as possible. But it is arguable that, if the Conference is not to break down in total disagreement (with the result that the last state would certainly be even worse than the first),the Government ought to be rather clearer in their own minds about the way in which it should be conducted before they launch their initiative. The point perhaps emerges most clearly in paragraph 7 of the memorandum entitled "Political Discussions on Northern Ireland" by the Northern Ireland Office in Londonwhich is annexed to GEN 79(72) 11. That paragraph, which is headed "Implications of a Plebiscite" reads as follows:-

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 090700 TO 120700 JUNE 1972 GENERAL 1, 
The most significant event of another busy weekend was the efficiency 
displayed by the UDA in erecting (and subsequently dismantling) a substantial number of barricades not only in Belfast, but in many places elsewhere in the Province. SF reacted calmly but the success of this exercise bodes ill for next weekend when the temporary no go areas are to become permanant unless, so 
the UDA claim, ’there is a positive response by SSNI towards the Creggan 
and Bogside’. The events to catch the headlines, after a relatively peaceful Friday and Saturday, were the gun battles in Belfast and Londonderry on Sunday. In Dunny the battle as usual centred round Bligh’s Lane, but had no special features apart from its intensity and reported ’heavy’ machine gun fire. In Belfast however, in the 1RRW area (ARDOYNE, OLD PARK, BONE) an intersectarian fire fight caused quit reaction by the SF. (Martin MEEHAN is said to be back in the Ardoyne). Three civilians (2 x RC, 1 x Protestant) were killed, the first of whom CAMPBELL (RC) is believed to have been shot by a Protestant. There were some hot pursuit searches-as a result of this battle, and eight weapons were recovered. Belfast is now quiet but tense, and all the barricades are down except in the BONE. There were no border incidents, but there was widespread barricading and a variety of minor incidents in the countryside. In the Republic the Wolfe Tone celebrations were well attended (23,000 claimed) and Sean KEENAN is reported by the Press to have said that the struggle will continue until Provisional IRA peace terms have been met in full. GB weekend press comment was mostly devoted to UD barricading. The President of the RCC LIBYA has declared his support for the Irish Revolutionaries ’to whom he has supplied arms’. 2. During Fri/Sat 9/10 Jun. There were 61 shooting incidents and 10 explosions. 
There were no regular military casualties but a UDR NCO was 
murdered as he left work. A sixteen year old girl was shot dead by gunmen and another 7 civilians were wounded in shooting incidents. SF claimed to have hit 2 gunmen in Belfast and 2 in Londonderry. A UDR soldier who was wounded in Londonderry on 6 Jun 72, died in hospital and an RUC Constable was shot in the back on his way to work, on the outskirts of Londonderry. During the period, more than 70 barricades were erected in Belfast, 6 in Lurgan and 7 in various places in Co Down. 
3. During Sat/Sun 10/11 Jun. There were 49 shooting incidents and 2 
explosions. There were no SF casualties but 1 gunman is believed to have been hit. 2 civilians were wounded in incidents not involving SF. More Protestant barricades were erected in Belfast and elsewhere in the Province and at 110600hrs it wa estimated that there were 126 barricades/obstructions in Belfast alone. Most of the shootings in Belfast occurred in the Ardoyne and Clonard/Divis area and there appeared to be some shots fired across the Northern Interface of the Ardoyne. Several UDA rallies passed off without incident. Two of these rallies were addressed by Messrs Faulkner, Craig and Enoch Powell. 
4. During Sun/Mon 11/12 Jun. There were 87 shooting incidents of which 67 involved SF. There were no explosions. A soldier was shot dead in Londonderry and two more wounded in Belfast. A policeman was injured by a booby trap near Newtownbutler. In an intersectarian gunbattle in the Ardoyne in which the SF engaged gunmen of both sides,three gunmen (two RC and one Protestant) were shot dead, and ten hits were claimed on other gunmen. Two civilians were injured by baton rounds in other incidents. The Protestant barricades in Belfast, Londonderry and the rural areas were removed by 0500hrs with the exception of the Bone area of Belfast

Northern Ireland - A Round Table Conference (GEN 79(72) 10) 
In his memorandum, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland 
proposes that as soon as the agreement of the Cabinet can be secured, an announcement should be made of the Government’s intention to set up a round table conference on the future of Northern Ireland. He envisages that the nucleus of the conference should be representatives of the recognised political parties in Northern Ireland; and that, if possible, it should first meet in the latter half of July. 
The 
background papers circulated under reference GEN 79(72) 11 suggest that he has in mind a conference in two phases, the first beginning in July and the second perhaps in November. 2. You have, on several occasions, urged upon the Secretary of State 
the importance of maintaining the momentum of political initiative at a pace sufficient to prevent the policy of reconciliation and military restraint from losing credibility. 
The Secretary of State expresses 
in paragraph 6 of his memorandum the conviction that time is not on our side, and that some positive political move is essential; and you may feel that the arguments against the early announcement of a conference set out in the Governor’s memorandum annexed to Mr. Whitelaw’s paper are too reminiscent of the sterile policy of the former Northern Ireland Government. 3. 
Nevertheless some of the Governor’s points deserve consideration. 
Ministers may wish to focus discussion upon the following questions which take some account both of Lord Grey’s misgivings and of the points made in the papers and conference record circulated behind GEN 79(72) 11:(a) What are "the recognised political parties in Northern Ireland"? 
The Secretary of State proposes (at least initially) to exclude the political parties in the United Kingdom as a whole.

Northern Ireland - 
Local Government Reform and Proportional Representation (GEN 79(72) 9) 
You have agreed that, in order to provide more time for 
discussion of this difficult subject, it should be the sole matter for discussion at Monday’s meeting and that the customary reports on the security situation may on this occasion be omitted; the Chief of the General Staff will therefore not be present. 2. 
At their meeting on 18 May (GEN 79(72) 18th Meeting, Item 2) 
Ministers provisionally decided that the local elections in Northern Ireland should be held on the planned date of 18 October 1972 on the basis of a simple majority vote. 
On 25 May (GEN 79(72) 19th Meeting, 
Item 2) they confirmed this decision after consideration of a detailed memorandum presented by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (GEN 79(72) 7). 
In his present memorandum the Secretary of State seeks 
a reversal of this decision: specifically he proposes that the reformed structure of local government should be introduced as planned on 1 April 1973 but that the local government elections should be postponed until November or December 1972 and held on the basis of a single transferable vote within new multi-member constituencies. 
His 
principal reasons for doing so are the pressure for proportional representation (PR) from opposition and moderate elements in Northern Ireland, including the new Advisory Commission; and the indications that if PR is not introduced for the forthcoming local government elections the Opposition at Westminster are likely to obstruct the whole of the Government’s legislative programme for Northern Ireland. 3. 
When Ministers previously discussed this subject they recognised 
that there was a reasonable case on merit for some form of PR in local government elections; and that it was politically relevant that the more moderate parties thought, rightly or wrongly, that its introduction

The Official Joint Security Committee has met in Belfast. Amongst other As agreed at the previous meeting the Northern Ireland Office will arrange 
for this to be considered in Belfast with a view to its being raised in the Joint Security Committee. The Northern Ireland Office will also cause to be examined the procedure whereby the RUC formally take charge of people arrested by the Army. Future policy on internees will depend on the developing situation. SOUTH ROCK LIGHTSHIP 5.

30 June, 1972. ARREST POLICY IN NORTHERN IRELAND You will have seen in telegram No. 448 from Dublin, 
reporting John Peck’s talk with Mr. Lynch on 23 June, his explanation in paragraph 3 about arrest policy following the ceasefire in Northern Ireland. In the light of what Mr. Whitelaw said in the GEN 79 last night, it may be that John Peck has not got the picture quite right, and I feel that we ought to make it as clear as we can. I enclose the draft of a letter I should like to send him if it is an accurate picture of our intentions. Would you kindly let me know by telephone if it is all right. I am sending a copy of this letter to Stephens in the 
Ministry of Defence. (Stewart Crawford)

FM DUBLIN 231715Z SECRET TO IMMEDIATE FCO TELNO 448 OF 23 JUNE AND TO UKREP BELFAST. 1. 
I GAVE HIM MR WHITELAW’S ORAL MESSAGE ABOUT HIS I SPENT OVER AN HOUR WITH THE TAOISEACH THIS AFTERNOON. I 
GAVE HIM THE TEXT CF THE STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND ALL. THE SUPPLEMENTARIES DEALING WITH THE CEASEFIRE. 
DESIRE TO MEET FOR A TALK AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME, AND HE EXPRESSED HIS OPINION THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT IN THE MEANTIME TO KEEP IN CLOSE AND CONTINUOUS TOUCH THROUGH THE NORMAL CHANNELS. I ALSO SAID THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE GENERAL APPRECIATION IN LONDON OF THE ACTION BEING TAKEN AGAINST THE iRA IN THE REPUBLIC WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THEIR DIFFICULTIES. 2. MR LYNCH SAID THAT THE IRA STATEMENT ABOUT THE CEASEFIRE WAS A MOST IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT. 
ISOLATED ACTS OF VIOLENCE 
WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY CONTINUE AT FIRST, AND HE HOPE WE WOULD NOT TAKE THEM TOO TRAGICALLY. 3. 
I THEN SAID I HAD TWO POINTS THAT MR WHITELAW WANTED TO RAISE 
wITH HIM. THE FIRST CONCERNED ’’HARASSMENT’’, THE INTERPRETATION OF THE WORD BY THE PROVISIONALS, AND THE WAY WE INTENDED TO REACT. I EXPLAINED THAT WE HAD A HANDFUL OF REAL BADDIES WHOM WE SHOULD HAVE TO DEAL SEVERELY WITH IF WE LAID HANDS ON THEM, AND THEY MIGHT WELL SLIP AWAY ELSEWHERE BEFORE WE CAUGHT THEM. 
IT MIGHT 
BE AS WELL IF ANY SUCH CHARACTERS NOW IN THE SOUTH WERE NOT ENCOURAGED BY THE THREAT OF SEVERE MEASURES THERE TO COME NORTH. MR LYNCH LOOK THE POINT, AND I ASKED HIM HOW HE SAW HIS OWN SECURITY POLICY WORKING OUT. HE SAID THAT OF COURSE A NEW SITUATION IN THE NORTH WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE, BUT THE SPECIAL COURT WAS A FLEXIBLE INSTRUMENT AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COULD DECIDE THAT CASES TO TAKE TO IT. THE IRA WOULD REMAIN AN ILLEGAL BODY, BUT THE EMPHASIS WOULD PROBABLY BE PLACED MORE ON ILLEGAL ACTS THAN ON POLITICAL LABELS. HE THINKS THIS CALLS FOR CLOSE COORDINATION BETWEEN US.

QUESTIONS FOR WRITTEN ANSWER ON TUESDAY 27 JUNE 1972 
Mr Stallard ( St.Pancras, North) : To ask the Secretary of state for Northern Ireland, when he expects to be able to make a report on the progress of the review of the Northern Ireland Special Powers Act; and if be will make a statement. 
Mr Stallard (St.Pancras, North): To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, when the Special Powers Act was last renewed; what is the normal procedure for its renewal; and if he will make a statement on this matter. 
DRAFT REPLY The Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act 
(Northern Ireland) 1922 was renewed annually by the Northern Ireland Parliament until 1928 when it was renewed for a period of five years. The Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1933 provided that the 1922 Act should remain in force until Parliament otherwise determined, and it has remained in force ever since. I have announced that I an reviewing the Act and the Regulations made under it. The review is under way and I will report to the House on its progress as such as I can.

Secretary of State 1. 
This minute is for the record. At about 5.30 p.m. on Monday 26 June you 
saw the Deputy Chief Constable, Mr Cairncross, the Civil Adviser to the GOC, Mr MDowall and myself. 2. 
You approved a new paragraph 9, with two sub-paragraphs, which is attached, 
to be inserted in the Army staff document "Security Forces Reactions to a Ceasefire". (This is the document which General Ford asked me last Wednesday to process through JSC(0) and submit to you. This was done, and a revised paragraph 9 was telexed to Northern Ireland.) The attached redraft is a clarification of the preceding instructions. 3. 
I explained that under sub-paragraph (ii) the persons affected would be those 
against whom there was already an arrest warrant, or sufficient evidence to charge the person on arrest with a crime; but it did not cover persons for whom there was neither evidence for a charge nor a warrant for arrest. I explained that the word "recognised" meant that the person would have to be seen and recognised as coming into the category above. 4. 
You approved the redrafted paragraph in the form it is attached, which 
incorporates the change of wording you asked for in the last sentence of (ii). 5. 
You agreed that these instructions should take effect from midnight tonight, 
and be subject to cancellation or variation by you in the event of a ceasefire not being achieved or sufficiently achieved. 6. 
You agreed that it should be at the discretion of the Army Commander and the 
Deputy Chief Constable how far down the line these instructions should be given in written form, but that it should be made clear that the instructions were an official secret and not for communication to unauthorised persons. 7. 
The revised instructions as attached would enable Mr McDowall to deny the rumour which has been widely publicised in the press that you had annulled or

cc Mr Cairncross Mr Woodfield 
Secretary of State 1. 
We have looked at the instructions to the Security Forces in regard to their 
conduct during a ceasefire. 2. 
It is our agreed view (NIO, Army, RUC) that the following passage should be 
inserted at paragraph 9 of the Army document "Security Forces Reactions to a Ceasefire" originating from CLF last Wednesday, which is intended to serve as a basis of more detailed instructions. 3. 
This passage is drafted on the simple basis that there is to be no 
"harassment" in respect of offences committed before the ceasefire, unless the offender "flaunts" himself: but that offences committed after the ceasefire are open to "harassment" under both the ordinary criminal law and the Special Powers Act so long as the Special Powers Act is not repealed. 4. 
The passage should be as follows: "Arrest policy after the ceasefire should be as follows: (i) In respect of offences under the criminal law, including specific offences under the Special Powers Act and regulations made thereunder, where the offence is alleged to have been committed after these instructions take effect, the due processes of the law will apply, including those under the Special Powers Act. 
(ii) In respect of offences under the criminal law, including specific offences under the Special Powers Act and regulations made thereunder, where the offence is alleged to have been committed before these instructions take effect, a person wanted for such an offence or unlawfully at large will be arrested if he is recognised and if there is a legal power to arrest him in the circumstances. No person will be arrested simply for the purpose of interrogation and/or detention leading to internment in regard to matters arising before the ceasefire."

D J Trevelyan Esq Northern Ireland Office 
"Arrest Policy", you touched upon problems that might arise following a truce. 
In your letter to Jack Howard-Drake of 9 June, about We have already discussed this aspect 
briefly and, without wishing to confuse the present debate on "Arrest Policy", I think it worthwhile trying to clear our minds now on the further problems that might arise upon a truce. 
2. If I understand the position correctly, it is generally 
held that, were the IRA to call a truce, it would be politically dangerous to "lift" known IRA leaders as their safe havens became open to normal police and Army activity. 
in effect, be an amnesty for those IRA men who had managed to evade capture until the date of the truce and who, if they had been captured, could only have been detained or interned under the Special Powers Act, since there was insufficient evidence against them to bring a criminal charge. 
3. But there are two further categories of IRA men. The second category is more difficult; First, 
those against whom there is sufficient evidence to bring a charge, but against whom no warrant has yet been issued. Presumably it is possible to arrange that such men are not charged. 
there 
must be many IRA men,often now taking refuge in the Republic, against whom warrants have been issued. 
If these warrants 
were to be withdrawn you would presumably bring down upon your head immediate calls for the "amnesty" to be extended to all those "political prisoners" who were unlucky enough to be caught and convicted on similar charges before the truce. No doubt you will hear that call anyway with increasing stridency in coming months; 
what I am now concerned with, 
however, is that we should not incur charges of bad faith, with all the attendant political problems, if we continue to arrest certain offenders even after the truce. 
This problem 
has, of course, a wider application than the particular FCO interest, but it was nonetheless a point that was put to me in Dublin recently, and I suspect the Irish Government is every bit as anxious as we are to maintain Mr Whitelaw’s good name for straight dealing in any immediate post-truce period. 
4. It therefore occurred to me that (at the time of any truce) 
it might be desirable for a public announcement to be made that warrants have been issued and will still be executed against 
So there would,

June 1972 COMMANDER LAND FORCES’ DIRECTIVE FOR 
FUTURE INTERNAL SECURITY OPERATIONS Reference: A. 1. 
CLF’s Conference with Bde Comds on 22 Jun 72. Attached is one copy of Commander Land Forces’ Directive 
for Future Internal Security Operations. It will come into effect at 2359 hrs Mon 26 Jun 72 when the Provisional IRA ceasefire begins. It is to be used as the basis for your brigade instructions. 
2. It should be noted that military powers of arrest are 
currently being examined at the highest level and therefore the guidance given in paragraph 6.g. and Annex A of the Directive is interim only and may be changed. 
3. 4. Once it is clear that the ceasefire is effective, further 
guidance will be issued on various aspects of the security situation, and amendments made to NISSIs 1971 and our Internal Security Instruction 1/72. 
Please acknowledge receipt on the enclosed MOD 24.

COMMANDER LAND FORCES DIRECTIVE FOR 
Reference: A. 
C. 
SITUATION 1. 
FUTURE INTERNAL SECURITY OPERATIONS B. 
NISSIs 1971. 
Our Internal Security Instruction 1/72 dated 13 Jun 72. Our NISEC 11 dated 16 Mar 72 as amended 26 May 72. 
accordance with my previous Directive (Reference B), have helped to produce a political atmosphere in which the movement for 
Operations in support of the Political Initiative, in 
peace has been able to flourish. Despite the continued IRA offensive the Security Forces have not over-reacted and therefore the Catholic community has increasingly demanded that the violence should stop and the Initiative be given a fair trial. The desire for peace has been strengthened by the emergence of the UDA and the realisation that the Protestant community is on the verge of retaliation. 
2. This mounting pressure for peace caused the Official IRA to 
announce on 29 May 72 "immediate suspension of all armed military action, reserving only the right of self defence and the defence of areas if attacked by the British military or sectarian forces". The Provisional IRA has now announced an "indefinite cessation of offensive operations" from midnight 26 Jun 72. This ceasefire is likely to be obeyed by the great majority of the membership. 
3. It is possible, however, that some violence will continue, 
at a reducing level, after the ceasefire comes into effect. This may come from many sources; Saor Eire, Provisional IRA who refuse to obey the ceasefire, Official IRA trying to ruin the ceasefire, Protestants who consider its acceptance a ’sell-out’, armed criminals, hooligans the IRA is unable to control, and sectarian clashes at interfaces. 
4. You are to act in support of HMG’s Political Initiative by 
continuing to assist the civil power in the maintenance, and restoration if necessary, of law and order throughout your brigade area, in conjunction with the RUC. 
EXECUTION 5. 
General Outline. 
a. On the assumption that the IRA ceasefire comes into effect at 2359 hrs 26 Jun 72, the Security Forces will cease offensive operations against the IRA from that time. 
b. The closest links are to continue to be maintained with the RUC, including Special Branch. In those areas where the RUC is unable to operate unsupported it is particularly important that operations should continue to be conducted jointly. In such areas combined RMP/RUC patrols are to be instituted wherever possible.

ANNEX A TO 1104 G ARREST POLICY 
1. The Special Powers Act, and Regulations made under it, has not been repealed, but the post-ceasefire situation demands that the powers of arrest under Regulation 10 and 11 are not used. Statute and Common Law, however, empower the soldier (like any other citizen) to arrest a person he sees committing, or whom he suspects on reasonable grounds to have committed, a breach of the peace or a serious offence such as serious assault, malicious damage, theft, or possession of an offensive weapon. Mere suspicion is not enough. These powers are commonly used by soldiers at present without recourse to Regulations under the Special Powers Act and are contained in Annex B to Part 3 Section 3 of NISSIs 1971. Their use should continue. 
2. The arrest procedures specified in the Blue Card are not there- 
fore to be used until further notice. 3. 
4. Arrests are to be made in response to the actual commission 
of criminal offences only. They are not to be made for the purpose of interrogation, detention or internment or on mere suspicion. 
Arrests are, wherever possible, to be made by members of the 
RUC. If, in an exceptional case, it is not possible for a member of the RUC to carry out an arrest, soldiers may do so as long as the Common and Statue Law powers of arrest apply. These powers apply essentially to the apprehension of a wrong-doer red-handed. 
5. An arrested person is to be taken to the nearest RUC station 
but not to a PHC. 6. 
The policy described in this Annex relates only to Regulations 
10 - 12 under the Special Powers Act and does not affect other powers under the Special Powers Regulations, for example those of search.

ARRESTS 1. 
The SPA and Regulations made under it will continue to be in operation 
but the new scope of operations means that these powers will be used sparingly. 2. 
Arrests will wherever possible be made by members of the RUC. 3. Arrests will not be made for the purpose of questioning, interrogation 
or internment under the SPA. Arrests will not be made under Regulation 10 of the SPA (which provides for arrests on the authority of a member of the RUC for the purpose of interrogation). 
4. Arrests will be carried out only for criminal offences. Statute and 
common law empower the soldier (like any other citizen) to arrest a person who is committing a breach of the peace or a serious offence such as serious assault, malicious damage, theft or possession of an offensive weapon. These powers are commonly used by soldiers at present, without recourse to the SPA. 
5. If, in an exceptional case, it is not possible for a member of the RUC 
to carry out an arrest, the soldier may still use Regulation 11 under the SPA if a criminal offence has been committed but there is doubt whether common and statute law powers of arrest apply. These powers apply essentially to the apprehension of a wrongdoer red-handed, whereas the powers under Regulation 11 entitle a soldier to arrest on suspicion. 
6. In all cases an arrested person is to be taken to the nearest RUC station and not to a PHC.

Secretary of State 1. 
This minute is for the record. At about 5.30 p.m. on Monday 26 June you 
saw the Deputy Chief Constable, Mr Cairncross, the Civil Adviser to the GOC, Mr McDowall and myself. 2. 
You approved a new paragraph 9, with two sub-paragraphs, which is attached, 
to be inserted in the Army staff document "Security Forces Reactions to a Ceasefire". (This is the document which General Ford asked me last Wednesday to process through JSC(0) and submit to you. This was done, and a revised paragraph 9 was telexed to Northern Ireland.) The attached redraft is a clarification of the preceding instructions. 3. 
I explained that under sub-paragraph (ii) the persons affected would be those 
against whom there was already an arrest warrant, or sufficient evidence to charge the person on arrest with a crime; but it did not cover persons for whom there was neither evidence for a charge nor a warrant for arrest. I explained that the word "recognised" meant that the person would have to be seen and recognised as coming into the category above. 4. 
You approved the redrafted paragraph in the form it is attached, which 
incorporates the change of wording you asked for in the last sentence of (ii). 5. 
You agreed that these instructions should take effect from midnight tonight, 
and be subject to cancellation or variation by you in the event of a ceasefire not being achieved or sufficiently achieved. 6. 
You agreed that it should be at the discretion of the Army Commander and the 
Deputy Chief Constable how far down the line these instructions should be given in written form, but that it should be made clear that the instructions were an official secret and not for communication to unauthorised persons. 7. 
The revised instructions as attached would enable Mr McDowall to deny the rumour which has been widely publicised in the press that you had annulled or

Every opportunity given by a ceasefire for the RUC to return to their proper primary role in the enforcement of law and order should be taken.

OFFENCES UNDER THE SPECIAL POWERS ACT 1. 
I attach a list of offences created by the Regulations together with 
the penalties where they are provided. 2. 
There are general provisions as to the trial of offences and penalties 
in sections 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the Act. Section 4 provides that where the Regulations do not give a specific penalty, the penalties for any offence shall be as follows:(a) on summary conviction, 2 years or £100 or both; (b) on indictment,3-14 years or £500 or both. 
3. Section 2(1) and (2) make it an offence to fail to comply with any 
order under the Regulations or to attempt, solicit or incite the commission of an act prohibited by the Regulations. Section 2(3) makes it an offence not to inform the civil authority of offences under the Regulations, and 2(4) creates the general offence of committing an act "of such a nature as to be calculated to be prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or maintenance of order ... and not specifically provided for in the Regulations". 
4. Section 3(2) provides that an offence against the Regulations shall not 
be prosecuted except on the authority of or on behalf of the Attorney-General, and "in accordance with such directions as may be given" by him.

21 June 1972 
D J Trevelyan Esq Northern Ireland Office 
"Arrest Policy", you touched upon problems that might arise following a truce. 
In your letter to Jack Howard-Drake of 9 June, about We have already discussed this aspect 
briefly and, without wishing to confuse the present debate on "Arrest Policy", I think it worthwhile trying to clear our minds now on the further problems that might arise upon a truce. 
2. If I understand the position correctly, it is generally 
held that, were the IRA to call a truce, it would be politically dangerous to "lift" known IRA leaders as their safe havens became open to normal police and Army activity. 
in effect, be an amnesty for those IRA men who had managed to evade capture until the date of the truce and who, if they had been captured, could only have been detained or interned under the Special Powers Act, since there was insufficient evidence against them to bring a criminal charge. 
3. But there are two further categories of IRA men. The second category is more difficult; First, 
those against whom there is sufficient evidence to bring a charge, but against whom no warrant has yet been issued. Presumably it is possible to arrange that such men are not charged. 
there 
must be many IRA men,often now taking refuge in the Republic, against whom warrants have been issued. 
If these warrants 
were to be withdrawn you would presumably bring down upon your head immediate calls for the "amnesty" to be extended to all those "political prisoners" who were unlucky enough to be caught and convicted on similar charges before the truce. No doubt you will hear that call anyway with increasing stridency in coming months; 
what I am now concerned with, 
however, is that we should not incur charges of bad faith, with all the attendant political problems, if we continue to arrest certain offenders even after the truce. 
This problem 
has, of course, a wider application than the particular FCO interest, but it was nonetheless a point that was put to me in Dublin recently, and I suspect the Irish Government is every bit as anxious as we are to maintain Mr Whitelaw’s good name for straight dealing in any immediate post-truce period. 
4. It therefore occurred to me that (at the time of any truce) 
it might be desirable for a public announcement to be made that warrants have been issued and will still be executed against

9 June 1972 
J T A Howard-Drake Esq Northern Ireland Office Stormont Castle BELFAST 
At this morning’s meeting which was held by Sir William Nield, Derek 
Stephen of M.O.D. raised the question of the arrangements by which persons arrested by the security forces are handed over to the police. 
The M.O.D. 
are anxious that the Army should be able to hand over such prisoners as soon as possible and I cannot do better than to send you the enclosed copy of a minute by Tony Stephens of 9 June which sets out his Department’s views. Sir William Nield undertook to have this looked into. 
I should perhaps also say that I was apprehensive, when I heard of the 
Army’s trawl of some eight IRA men recently, lest there should follow, as night the day, the usual allegations of ill-treatment. 
This, in fact, 
happened: the Times carried the next day allegations that two of the arrested men had been tortured. 
I spoke to Carol Jackson about this and 
said that I hoped that the RUC had done everything possible to obtain evidence to refut such charges. 
What seems now to be required is a speedy review of RUC procedures for 
dealing with arrested men so as to deal both with M.O.D. anxiety about the arrangements for the RUC taking delivery of prisoners and with the procedure thereafter to protect the RUC from allegations of brutality and to avoid prejudicing criminal charges, if they are subsequently preferred. Ellis’ current enquiries will help us on the latter problem. work is already in hand. 
Some of this May I leave it to you to commission such further 
work as may be required? I am sending a copy of this letter to Tony Hetherington (A.G.’s Office) 
and Tony Stephens (M.O.D.) D J TREVELYAN

ARRESTS IN NEW LODGE ON 5 JUNE 1972 You asked to be kept informed as more details became 
available about the arrests by 2 Para of eight men in the New Lodge area in central Belfast on Monday 5 June. 2. 
I attach a note which M04 have let me have which shows 
the times at which the eight men were arrested, arrived at the Police Station, and were taken to the PHC. You will see that this is another case where Special Branch chose to conduct their initial questioning other than at the PHC; however, this does not mean that it was a repeat of the Broadway episode in April, since Glenravel is a Police Station as well as an Army command post. Nevertheless this practice does tend to blur the point at which arrestees pass into Police hands and become a Police responsibility; and it is rather worrying that in the present case the RUC were apparently very reluctant to sign for the arrestees,to the extent that they only got round to doing so about eight hours after the men arrived at Glenravel and about four hours after they had been removed to Holywood. This is obviously a point which we will have to press NIO about, either in the context of asking for a copy of the RUC’s instructions about arrests and prisoner handling, or separately. 
3. As you know, NICRA sent a telegram to SSNI on Tuesday 
apparently alleging that one of the eight; who had since been released, had been "tortured" by the Army - and that another had been ill-treated by the RUC under questioning. It is not yet clear at what stage of the afternoon the Army’s offence is supposed to have occurred; until we know this, we cannot tell whether there is any scope for pointing out publicly 
- separately from and in 
advance of Mr. Whitelaw’s reply to NICRA - that the Army not only did not but could not have done what was alleged, for lack of opportunity. M04 are pursuing this.

Arrest Policy At the request of GEN 79, we have been examing the implications of 
arresting IRA leaders from the South if they visit Northern Ireland, end draft minutes were prepared here, and sent by Neil Cairncross to Philip Woodfield, for S of S to consider sending to the Prime Minister. 
know, on 2nd June I told Carol Jackson the policy which S of S wanted pursued over that weekend. 
As you In fact, no "notables" appeared, but on Monday, 
5th June, it was reported that the Army had arrested eight people, four of whoa were on a "wanted" list, three being senior officers of the Provisional IRA. 
and it was agreed that I should write to you about the subject generally. The feeling here was that the Army should know precisely the 
circumstances in which they ought to make an arrest. It will, no doubt, 
still be necessary for them to continue to work from a list of wanted people, but it seems to be necessary to check which people really need to be arrested, and for what purposes. to be on the list. 
Do we, for example, wish some people to be arrested 
simply for questioning under Regulation 10, being released after 48 hours? There may be a few people wanted for possible detention; but this merely stores up difficulties for ourselves in the future. 
I do not know what 
this problem looks like from your end, but the feeling here was that a review of the lists used by the Army and the RUC should be set in hand, and that the whole subject brought before the Joint Security Committee.

In drawing up Our message I expect 
you have this point on board already. Part of my message to Carol Jackson was that the police should start 
By this we meant that the R.U.C. 
should see what weight can be placed on the activities or public utterances of men like Sean Stephenson in Northern Ireland: could a prosecution be based on them? 
It is very much a second best to have to arrest people under 
Regulations 10 or 11, and the only other way is to arrest them for suspected criminal offences, even if only under such provisions as conspiracy, breach of the peace, incitement etc. 
It may be that the Director of Public 
Prosecutions could give the R.U.C. some guidance on the preparation of such cases. 
Which people, in other words, ought This was discussed at Neil Cairncross’ meeting on Tuesday

Access to Report of the Committee of Privy Counsellors (Cmnd. 4901) Sir Burke Trend has asked me to send you the enclosed copy of a 
letter the Cabinet Office have received from the Treasury Solicitor’s Department (without attachments). Sir Burke Trend proposes, unless any Department dissents, that the records of the Committee, which are held in the Cabinet Office, should be examined by the Treasury Solicitor and a representative of the Ministry of Defence (I think it would be Ekins-Daukes of C2(AD)?) in order to see whether there are any papers relevant to the case in question, 
and, if there are, whether or not they 
may be declassified without prejudice to the security of the information or the impartiality of Lord Parker’s Committee. Sir Burke Trend’s own view is that any decision on release of the papers, if the examination of them suggests that this might be acceptable, should be taken by the Ministers concerned; he will be considering how Ministerial consideration of this would best be arranged. 
I am sending copies of this letter to Liz Sermon, Bronwen Peters 
and Tony Hetherington; and I should be very grateful if they, and you, could let me know by the end of the week if the method of proceeding outlined above does not commend itself. 
I am also sending a copy of this letter, for his information, to Christopher Roberts at No. 10. B. M. Norbury) M. Gatesborough, Esq.

L F Ridgewell Esq Cabinet Office Whitehall London SW1A 2AS 
Dear Ridgewell PATRICK SHIVERS -v- FAULKNER & ORS REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVY COUNSELLORS (Cmnd 4901) 
We spoke on the telephone on 9 June about this case. I enclose for your information a copy of the Pleadings in the case commenced by Shivers in the Northern Ireland High Court together with a copy of the letter from his solicitors dated 23 May 1972 in which they seek discovery of documents. 
Having regard to the allegations made in the Statement of Claim it is possible that there may be some relevant documents in the papers which were considered by Lord Parker and his colleagues. On the basis that the Crown is one and indivisible, there should, in theory, be discovery of all such documents. It may well be that Crown Privilege will have to be claimed for some of these documents but before that can be done we must blow what documents exist. 
I shall be grateful if you will let me know where and when the papers can be seen. 
I have spoken to Ekins-Daukes of C2AD Ministry of Defence about this and I think we would probably wish to examine the documents together. 
This office has just undertaken a similar exercise in connection with the Compton papers. I fear that the question of discovery of documents is likely to give us a great deal of trouble in many of the actions now being brought against the Crown in Northern Ireland.

20th June, 1972 GEN 79: DIRECTIVE ON INTERROGATION The Lord President has a few comments on the 
Directive on Interrogation with a view to the possibility of its eventual, perhaps accidental, publication. 
2. The second half of the first sentence of 
paragraph 7 rather gives the impression of very lengthy interrogation continuing by day and by night and allowing little opportunity for sleep (contrary to subparagraph (d) of that paragraph). 
The Lord 
President would prefer to replace everything after "atmosphere" with "and it may in some circumstances be necessary for interrogation to be carried out by night". 
3. In the penultimate sentence of paragraph 7 "proper" 
would be a better word than "reasonable". 4. 
5. In the second sentence of paragraph 8 "while 
interrogation is in progress" would sound better than "throughout the operation".

2. In your minute of yesterday’s dat you asked for comments 
on the Prime Minister’s minute of 8 June on the subject of the revised Directive about interrogation. 
I find the Prime Minister’s question about the possibility 
of publication in the third paragraph of his minute distinctly odd. SofS made it clear, for example, in his minute to the Prime Minister of 19 May that the Directive was written with the possibility in mind that it might have to be published. Sir Burke Trend made the same point in his minute to the Prime Minister of 12 May. The short answer to the Prime Minister’s question therefore is that the Directive was definitely considered from the point of view of possible publication. The JIC have also confirmed that its publication in full would not harm our intelligence interests. 
3. You also asked in the third paragraph of your minute whether 
there was anything further which we need to do in respect of instructions to the Security Forces on the questioning of detainees. The answer to this is given in the third paragraph of the attached draft minute prepared by AUS(GS).

INTERROGATION: REVISED DIRECTIVE Your minute of 14 June asked about the considerations 
which bear on the publication of this directive. The draft 
directive was worded with an eye to the possibility that it would have to be published. 
This does not, of course, 
imply that we should volunteer its publication; and indeed there is no valid reason for doing so. 
Parliament (in particular, Mr Cunningham) have taken an active interest in the subject of interrogation; 
they now that the directive of which extracts were published 
with the Parker Report has been under revision: and they may well press to know the result. 
If the Government then 
refuse to publish the revised directive, they are likely to be charged with having something to conceal; and this charge could be refuted only in part by giving Parliament 
a condensed or paraphrased version of the directive. Since the JIC have confirmed that its publication in full 
would not harm our intelligence interests, I would advise seems to 
that - as the Prime Minister’s minute imply - Ministers should be prepared to agree to publication if there is string pressure for this. 2. 
But some Members of I should add that the directive itself is essentially 
about the safeguards to be adopted in any future interrogation operation and that the methods of questioning used
