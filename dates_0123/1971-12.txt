NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 43 29 DECEMBER 1971 
Incidents during the period 23 - 28 December The period of the Christmas holiday passed quite quietly, with 
comparatively few minor incidents and no really major ones. (A dayby-day summary of the incidents which did occur is attached at Annex.) Throughout the period there were 16 explosions 
- as well as a number 
of bomb hoaxes - and 44 outbreaks of shooting. There were gunshot wounds, fortunately all slight, to a soldier of 1 Glosters in Belfast on 27 December and to two RUC constables in Strabane on 28 December; and one terrorist is believed to have been hit. One soldier and one civilian were fatally injured in accidents involving Service vehicles. Altogether 61 wanted persons were arrested during the period, none of them of outstanding importance but including two IRA quartermasters. 2. 
Yesterday was the least peaceful day in the period, with some 
minor rioting of the usual kind in Londonderrry in reaction to a successful search operation in the Boside. 3. 
A bomb which had failed to explode has been found on the 
premises of the Grand Orange Lodge in Glasgow. Staff for internment and detention 
4. It is hoped that the first results of the Home Office’s trawl 
for volunteers from the British Prisons Service to serve in Northern Ireland will be known within two or three days. There is not then expected to be much delay in sending over the volunteers as they become available. The need thus to reinforce the warder staff in Northern Ireland, and to stiffen it with some extra experience, remains very urgent if the capacity for accommodating internees and detainees is not to fall too far behind the rate of arrests and internments implicit in the present concept of operations. So far it has not been necessary to halt arrests, but they are having to be

FOLLOWING FOR ARMSTRONG FROM GREGSON YESTERDAY’S TALKS BETWEEN THE LABOUR PARTY, THE IRISH LABOR 
PARTY, THE NILP AND THE SDLP ARE NOT GIVEN MUCH PROMINENCE IN TODAY’S NEWSPAPERS. NO PAPER IS VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT, IF ANYTHING, WAS AGREED. THE TIMES HEADLINE IS : 
" STALEMATE IN LABOUR 
MEETING ON PROVINCE’’ AND THE GUARDIAN SAYS: ’’ ALL THE SIGNS ARE THAT THE MEETING REACHED VIRTUAL DEADLOCK ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE SDLP WOULD TAKE PART IN THE ALL PARTY TALKS’’. AFTER THE MEETING FITT SAID: ’’WE HAVE RESERVED OUR POSITION ON THE QUESTION OF INTERNMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT BEFORE ANY MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS TAKE PLACE THE SYSTEM OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL MUST BE ENDED’’. 
2. WAS AS FOLLOWS : 
HOWEVER THE BRITISH LABOUR PARTY’S STATEMENT AFTER THE MEETING ’’ AS A RESULT OF THE DISCUSSION THE BRITISH LABOUR 
PARTY INTENDS TO SEEK A FORMAL ASSURANCE FROM HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT THAT THEY ARE IN FAVOUR OF INTER-PARTY TALKS AND WERE SUCH TALKS ARRANGED THE AGENDA WOULD BE ENTIRELY OPEN-ENDED, AN IN PARTICULAR WOULD PERMIT EACH OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED TO PLACE ANY ITEMS ON THE AGENDA, FOR EXAMPLE, SECURITY, AND THE TRANSFER OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT FROM STORMONT TO WESTMINSTER". CALLAGHAN LAID PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE LAST POINT IN A BRIEF INTERVIEW ON TELEVISION LAST NIGHT. 
3. THERE IS LITTLE PRESSURE FOR A REACTION FROM THE GOVERMENT. 
OUR LINE IS THAT WE ARE SORRY THAT THE SDLP ARE STILL UNWILLING TO TAKE PART IN TALKS, AND THAT MR. CALLAGHAD WILL NO DOUBT BE IN TOUCH AGAIN WITH THE HOME SECRETARY.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 39 20 DECEMBER 1971 
Incidents in th last 72 hours -It was a comparativey quiet weekend; but there were four 
civilian deaths on Saturday, resulting from explosions. At Magherafelt three youngmen were killed when the car in which they were travelling was blown to pieces, apparently by a bomb which they were carrying. A pistol was found under one of the bodies. In the Clonard area of Belfast 
- a mixed area - an explosion at Murtagh’s 
Bar killed a boy of sixteen who was employed there and caused minor injuries to three other people. 2. 
Earlier on Friday, bombs caused extensive damage in a printing 
works in Belfast and also damaged the RUC station at Castledawson and a small transformer at Portglenoe. 
On Sunday evening an 
explosion in a shirt factory in Belfast injured one civilian and started a fire which gutted the building. 3. 
There were also several shooting incidents. On Friday there 
were three in Belfast - in one of which a soldier was shot in the shoulder 
- and four in Londonderry. On Saturday there were another 
seven in Londonderry - in one of which, terrorist snipers who were aiming at a military patrol hit and seriously injured a woman bystander; there there two more in Belfast 
- in one of which a soldier 
was shot in the arm; and at Pomeroy the RUC station was fired on from three passing cars, with no casualties and with no apparent hits when the fire was returned. 4.

20th December 1971 I understand that while the Home Secretary was in 
Northern Ireland last week he was given a briefing on Army force levels and told of a proposal to raise the force level in Northern Ireland to a total of 17 battalions for four months from 26th January 1972. I believe that it was explained to him that the reason for this was primarily because certain four company battalions were being replaced by three company battalions and an additional unit was therefore required to maintain the number of operational troops at a steady level and avoid the reduction which would otherwise temporarily occur. The Home Secretary may wish to be aware that the Defence Secretary has today approved this proposal. Arrangements will be made to explain to the press that the reinforcement is of a technical rather than of a substantive nature. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Peter Gregson at No 10. (R J ANDREW) G L Angel Esq

DEDIP SECRET TO FLASH UKDEL BERMUDA TEL NO 30 OF 20 DECEMBER. FOLLOWING PERSONAL FOR PRIME MINISTER FROM HOME SECRETARY. YOUR TELEGRAM NO 24: INTER-PARTY TALKS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR MESSAGE ABOUT MY MEETING WITH CALLAGHAN. I ENTIRELY SHARE YOUR CAUTION. PART OF THE TROUBLE IS THAT CALLAGHAN SEEMS TO HAVE LOST CONTACT WITH REALITY AND WE DO NOT KNOW HOW FAR THIS STEMS FROM HIS NOW RATHER PECULIAR RELATIONS WITH WILSON IN THIS FIELD. I AM SURE WE SHOULD MOVE SLOWLY. I AM EQUALLY SURE WE SHOULD NOT APPEAR TO BE DELIBERATELY PUTTING A BRAKE ON THINGS. IF THE SDLP SHOULD AGREE TO COME TO TALKS WITHOUT CONDITION THIS IS NO MORE THAN WE HAVE ASKED THEM TO DO ALREADY. EVEN IF THEY DO ACCEPT THI WHICH IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN, THERE IS MUCH TO BE DEFINED BEFORE TALKS CAN TAKE PLACE AT WHICH ALL WILL BE PRESENT. I AM KEEPING BRIAN FAULKNER FULLY IN TOUCH.

SECRET TO FLASH F.C.O. TELNO. UKDEL 024 OF 19 DECEMBER. PLEASE PASS FOLLOWING PERSONAL MESSAGE TO HOME SECRETARY FROM PRIME MINISTER. I HAVE JUST SEEN THE NOTE OF YOUR MEETING WITH CALLAGHAN ON 17 DECEMBER TO DISCUSS INTER-PARTY TALKS. IT HAS MADE ME MORE THAN EVER CONSCIOUS OF THE DANGERS WHICH WE HAVE TO TRY TO AVOID AND THE NEED FOR THE GREATEST CAUTION. IT EMERGES CLEARLY FROM THE NOTE THAT THE LABOUR PARTY ARE ALL SET TO DO IN THE UNIONIST GOVERNMENT AND PARTY IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND WOULD NOT BE GREATLY CONCERNED IF DIRECT RULE WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF DOING SO. IF WE GO INTO THESE TALKS WITHOUT A VERY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ARE FROM OUR OWN POINT OF VIEW THE LIMITATIONS UPON THEM AND WHERE WE WANT TO GET TO, THERE WILL BE A RISK THAT GOING INTO THE TALKS WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF COMPLETELY UNDERMINING FAULKNER AND HIS GOVERNMENT. YOU WILL ALSO HAVE SEEN THE NOTE OF MY TALK WITH THE WESTMISTER ULSTER UNIONISTS. THEY ARE VERY APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE INTER PARTY TALKS, AND ASK TO BE CONSULTED AS A DISTINCT PARTY. WE MAY NOT WANT TO AGREE, BUT WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THEIR POSITION AND OF THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH THEY CAN MAKE. ALL THIS ENFORCES MY OWN STRONG FEELING THAT WE SHOULD MAKE A GREAT MISTAKE IF WE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO GET VERY FAR INVOLVED IN INTER-PARTY TALKS BETWEEN WESTMINSTER AND STORMONT UNTIL WE HAVE A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION FRONT BENCHES IN LONDON NOT JUST ON PROCEDURE BUT ALSO ON QUESTIONS OF SUBSTANCE. WE OUGHT AT LEAST TO IDENTIFY MORE CLEARLY WHERE WE AGREE AND WHERE WE DISAGREE. YOU WILL NO DOUBT CONSIDER WITH THE LORD PRESIDENT HOW TO REACT PUBLICLY TO THE OUTCOME OF THE TALKS BETWEEN LABOUR PARTIES IN LONDON TOMORROW. MY OWN VIEW IS THAT YOU MAY NEED TO GET IT FIRMLY ON THE RECORD THAT THERE ARE CERTA IN MATTERS WHICH ARE FOR THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE, AND WHICH ARE NOT FOR NEGOTIATION IN INTER-PARTY TALKS: FOR INSTANCE, THE ROLE OF THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE MEASURES REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN SECURITY AND RESTORE LAW AND ORDER.

question. 
I am afraid there is no simple answer to your The formal position is that responsibi- 
lity for law and order matters rests with the Government of Northern Ireland. 
In present circum- 
stances, however, it is unrealistic to stand rigidly on this position in Parliament, and questions about murders or explosions are answered by the Department best able to provide the relevant information. 
most recent example was a question about the explosion at McGurk’s Bar. 
This was answered by 
the Ministry of Defence since the army exports were best able to provide information about what sort of bomb it was, where it had been placed and where it had gone off.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 38 17 DECEMBER 1971 
Incidents in the last 24 hours The period was comparatively quiet, with only minor incidents. 
A mobile patrol came under automtic fire at Armagh and sustained three slight casualties. Shots were also fired at patrols in the Forkill area on three occasions, In Belfast, a policeman was slightly wounded by gunfire; and an Army patrol was fired on but with no casualties. There were also four minor shooting incidents in Londonderry, in which there were no casualties to the security forces but one gunman may have been hit, 2. 
An explosion damaged a transformer near Newry, and there were 
two minor explosions in Belfast. There were also fires at Coalisland, where a refuse lorry was burned, and at Forkill where a house was burned, and a masked man attempted to set fire to an air cylinder store at Lurgan. 3. 
Information given by number two in the IRA in 
Armagh, who was arrested on 14 December - led to four shotguns being found near Portadown. Other searches uncovered three rifles in Whiterock, Belfast, and a claymore mine near Lurgan. 4. 
Arrests of juveniles 5. 
The meeting between the GOC and a delegation of teachers 
yesterday went well, with a constructive discussion; and the teachers agreed to put out a statement afterwards in reasonable terms. Staff for internment 6. 
The trawl for volunteers from the British Prisons Service to 
reinforce the warder staff in Northern Ireland was put out yesterday and there is cautious optimism that something like 150 volnteers 
There were twenty-one arrests of wanted persons during the period

INTER-PARTY TALKS ON NORTHERN IRELAND 1. It might be useful for your meeting with Mr Callaghan tomorrow to have this note on points which have occurred to us in connection with inter-party talks on Northern Ireland. 2. Although "nuts end bolts" questions such as the number of representatives from political parties will be important there are some problems 
about the 
substantive questions in which it would surely be desirable to have preliminary discussions between the two front benches at Westminster, on a Privy Councillor basis, to see what measure of agreement might be For example, if following what the Northern Ireland 
Attorney General suggested at your meeting in Belfast on 14 December it is 
possible to make a radical change in the procedures for internment this is about 
something which it might be helpful to talk about/to the Opposition front bench in confidence. 3. Although the Government would not wish to appear to be holding back on their agreement in principle to talks, the Opposition front bench must recognise: (a) the danger in a number of likely topics of participitating direct rule unintentionally, for example, by driving Mr Faulkner to a position where he has to withdraw or resign, 
(b) the security problems in timing on which the Government are entitled to consult the Army and which the Opposition would surely wish to be informed about, again on a rivy Councillor basis, 
(c) similarly, there may be intelligence of a highly confidential

You sent Robert Andrew a copy of your letter of 
8th December to Graham Angel about the suggestion of using an Adjournment Debate to create some Parliamentary pressure on the Government of the Irish Republic over the inadequacy of their steps for dealing with the IRA. 
The Defence Secretary has considerable doubts of 
the practical value of such a move. Apart from its doubtful positive value, there is also the danger that it might redound to our disadvantage. 
I am sending copies of this letter to the recipients of yours. (R A CUSTIS) N J Barrington Esq

NOTE FOR THE RECORD Northern Ireland The Leader of the Opposition and Mr. Callaghan came to 
see the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary at 10 Downing Street on Wednesday 15 December at 4.45 p.m. The Leader of the Opposition said that the 
Cabinet had taken up a rather different position from the one which he had suggested in his speech on the arrangements for the proposed inter-party talks. The Shadow Cabinet now thought, and he agreed, that of starting with talks between front and back bench members of the three parties at Westminster, the initial talks should be between the Government and members of the Opposition front bench, and that it would be right to proceed straight from those to inter-party talks between Westminister and Stormont. 
The Opposition now saw no need 
to include Government or pposition backbenchers in the first stage, which would therefore consist of talks betWeen the two front benches at Westminster. r. Wilson and Mr. Callaghan said that they would 
not wish to discuss internment with the Goverment in the initial talks. 
It could queer the pitch later if they 
were thought to have been having private discussions with the Government about interment. 
But this subject was bound 
to be on the agenda for the discussions with the parties at Stormont.

14 December, 1971 Following your telephone message yesterday afternoon 
about where responsibility lies in Whitehall for answering questions about civil offences in Northern Ireland, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary agreed, most reluctantly I might add, to say merely that it was not for him to make a statement about the murder of Senator Barnhill. He has, however, instructed me to find out for certain where responsibility lies, so that he is not put in a similar position of uncertainty in the future. 
Sir Alec considers that Members of Parliament would 
rightly take serious exception to being told that there is no Minister in the Whitehall Government responsible for answering questions about law and order in Northern Ireland, even though, constitutionally, law and order there is a matter for Stormont. Equally, although it is not a matter for him, he is surprised that it should be suggested that the Defence Secretary should be responsible for answering questions about a matter which must be for investigation by the civil police. When a British subject is involved in a police matter in a foreign country, the Foreign Secretary, who of course is not responsible for law and order in the foreign country, nevertheless answers in Westminster. 
Perhaps you could let me know what I should advise 
Sir Alec should the matter come up again. I am copying this letter to Andrew (Ministry of Defence), 
Gregson (No. 10), and Davies (Office of The Lord President of the Council).

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 34 13 DECEMBER 1971 
Incidents in the last 72 hours Altogether there were very much fewer separate incidents than 
during the other 2 weekends, but the period was marred by 3 particularly cold-blooded IRA attacks. 2. 
In Belfast, 2 male civilians and 2 babies were killed when an 
explosion completely demolished a furnishing shop in the Shankill area, shortly. after mid-day on Saturday. Significantly, although this is normally regarded as a militant Protestant area, no antiCatholic disturbances ensued. 3. 
Early on Sunday evening, senator Barnhill - a prominent Unionist politican - was attacked in his home near the border, just north of 
Strabane. The gunmen shot him 2 or 3 times, then dragged his body into the dining-room and placed it beside a bomb 
- having ordered Mrs. 
Barnhill out of the house. The bomb then exploded and demolished half the house. This attack is consistent with the expectation that the IRA would go increasingly for easy targets which would also have publicity value. 4. 
Details are now available of the murder of Sergeant Smyth on Friday morning - the third murder of an off-duty member of the UDR on 
successive days. Smyth, who was a Protestant, was travelling in his private land rover with a companion, McCormack (a Roman Catholic who had been in the UDR but had resigned). They stopped at a farmhouse gate to pick up another man, Leith (a Protestant with no UDR connections), when 2 shots were fired from bushes nearby, killing McCormack. The gunman then came forward and fired point-blank at Smyth, who had dived for cover, killing him; and then, completely ignoring Leith, walked away to join a companion heading for the border 200 metres away. Leith then raised the alarm.

Northern Ireland The agenda on Monday morning can perhaps be conveniently 
divided under the following three headings:A. 
Situation reports, as necessary. We shall need to have the Army’s 
assessment of the renewed outburst of violence in the last few days in the light of the intelligence reports that the IRA (particularly the Brady faction) are becoming increasingly disorganised and disheartened. 
Is the murder 
of the 2 UDR men a precursor of a campaign directed against the UDR or Roman Catholic members of it? If so, are measures being taken? What is the situation over Protestant extremists? Who blew up McGurk’s bar? The latest intelligence reports suggest that the explosion was caused accidently amongst a group which contained an identified Brady IRA victim Have further investigations shed more light? 2. 
It might be as well to check, in addition, that the police in this 
country are ready to deal with any IRA attacks on public utilities over Christmas, about which there have been several rumours. 3. 
In addition the following specific questions need attention:(i) 
Internment procedures. The Home Secretary raised with 
Mr. Faulkner at their recent meeting the possibility of improving these procedures, e. g. by giving an internee a written statement of the allegation against him; by considering appeals in two stages, with legal representation at one but not at the other; and by enlarging the Appeals Committee in order to accelerate the hearings. Mr. Faulkner undertook to submit proposals on all these points; but we should keep up the pressure to ensure that he does so. 
(ii) 
Internment accommodation. Arrests continue at a pretty high level; and the pressure on accommodation is again becoming acute. Against the background of the ICRC report, we cannot afford a scandal on this point; and, since there seems to be some difference of view between the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence about the action to be taken (see the minute of 9th December from the Secretary of State for Defence to the Home Secretary), it would be useful to clarify this point and to define the responsibility for dealing with it.

NOHTERN IRELAND CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 33 10 DECEMBER 1971 Incidents in the last 24 hours There was a good deal of shooting during the period. The main 
trouble was in Londonderry where there were frequent attacks, with gunfire and nail bombs, against the Army patrols, search parties and posts. Troops were obliged to return fire on a number of occasions and it is believed that 4 nail bombers and 3 gunmen were hit 
military casualties,both slight, and a small girl was wounded by shots which went through her bedroom window. 2. 
There were 5 shooting incidents in Belfast, mainly in the 
area, resulting in one soldier being slightly wounded. Outside the towns, Army patrols were fired on in the areas of Rosslea and Middletown 
- the fire being returned in each case - and 2 UDR 
vehicles were hit by a claymore-type mine just south of Armagh. There were no casualties. Acting on information, troops discovered quantities of explosives, ammunition and grenades in,a car in Armagh. 3. 
- being pulled away by the crowd in every case. There were 2 
Early this morning it was learned that a third member of the UDR - Sergenat Smith, a Protestant - had been murdered in his home, 
about 400 yards from the border in the area of Strabane. Arrests of young persons 4. 
UKREP is endeavouring to find out who took the decision to 
round up a number of young people for questioning, before the Army were asked to make the arrests. The troops have clear instructions that juveniles arrested in any circumstances are to be handed over to the RUC at a police station and not taken to a Police Holding Centre. 5. 
There was a question on this subject in the Dail yesterday; it was made clear to the Irish Ambassador, when he called at FCO to

NORTHERN IRELAND - INTERNMENT ACCOMMODATION As you know, there are immediate problems in providing 
sufficient accommodation for internees and detainees in Northern Ireland to keep pace with the number of terrorists on whom detention and internment orders are being served. 
2. The Northern Ireland Government have asked that, to deal 
with the bulk of the prospective excess, use should again be made of the accommodation ship MAIDSTONE 
- this time to house up to 150 internees. From the Army’s point of view, this is an 
extremely inconvenient request, since we had hoped to use MAIDSTONE (together with another accommodation ship HARTLAND POINT, which is being moved to Belfast later this month) for much-needed accommodation for soldiers during the winter months. Nevertheless, on the facts as presented to me, I can see no alternative: I have therefore reluctantly agreed that MAIDSTONE should be made available for this purpose. At the same time, I must place on record some dissatisfaction that the matter has been presented for Ministerial decision in this form and at such short notice, when Sir James Dunnett has for some time been drawing attention at his daily meetings to the evident need for the Prison Authorities to take steps to meet the crisis that was only too evidently developing and when I understand that the GOC has similarly been warning the Northern Ireland Government of the difficulties ahead. 
3. If MAIDSTONE is to be used it will of course be essential 
that there should be adequate arrangements for guarding the inmates. I learn from the GOC that the Northern Ireland Prison Service are hardpressed to find sufficient custodial staff for the task of guarding internees, and this problem will be aggravated by the re-opening of MAIDSTONE. No doubt you are considering this aspect of the matter. It may be something which should be raised at our GEN 47 meeting on Monday morning. 
I am copying this minute to the Prime Minister, to our other colleagues on GEN 47 and to Sir Burke Trend.

9th December 1971 You wrote to Graham Angel on 8th December 
about a discussion which the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had with a number of M.Ps led by Mr. Robin Chichester-Clark in which the possibility of an adjournment debate was discussed. 
The Home Secretary’s view is that such a debate 
could produce no practical result and could do harm. He recognises that to threaten the Republic may give emotional satisfaction in some quarters, but in his view it could produce no practical result.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 32 9 DECEMBER 1971 
Incidents in the last 24 hours After two days of comparative quiet, there was an increase in 
the number of incidents during the past 24 hours - but they did not appear to consist of a publicity-orientated campaign on this occasion. For the second day running, the most serious incident was the murder of an off-duty soldier of the UDR in his own home. Unlike the previous day’s murder however the victim this time - 
Private Sean Russell - was a Roman Catholic and lived in the middle of a Catholic 
area of Belfast. He was shot down in front of his own children a fact which is fully brought out in today’s newspaper reports. It is feared that his murder may be the start of a new campaign of intimidation directed primarily against Catholic members of the Regiment. 2. 
There were 8 other shooting incidents in Belfast, resulting in 
two soldiers being seriously wounded and two others slightly. At Newry a patrol of 42 Commando RM was ambushed and the IRA gunfire seriously wounded one marine and also injured 4 civilians at a bus stop near by. In Londonderry two soldiers were slightly wounded when nail bombs were thrown; and a girl of 16 was seriously wounded by an IRA sniper bullet. There were several minor out-breaks of rioting during the day in Londonderry and Strabane. 3. 
at the weekend in the rioting which followed the explosion at McGurk’s Bar in Belfast. 4. 
The death occurred of Major Snow, of 2 RRF, who had been wounded During the day there were a number of explosions and fires, 
mainly in Belfast and Strabane. In Belfast the Scots Guards uncovered several caches of weapons., which included 15 firearms, 3445 rounds of ammunition and gelignite and bomb-making equipment.

8 December, 1971 A number of MP’s, led by Robin Chichester-Clark, and 
mostly Ulster Unionists, called upon the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary on 6 December. They made a general plea for more diplomatic pressure on the Irish Republic, citing as particular anxieties the derisory court decisions in the South, extradition, and control of the Border. The question of sanctions against the Republic was of course raised. 
To this extent the meeting was predictable. I 
write because the MPs obviously thought some public pressure might profitably be applied to make Irish failings better known. Anthony Buck is considering seeking an adjournment debate and asked whether it would cause embarrassment. Sir Alec Douglas-Home said that it would not much embarrass the FCO, but before any decision were made the Home Secretary should be consulted. Sir Alec had it in mind that such a debate would inevitably attract speakers from both sides, and that there would be many ready to attack Her Majesty’s Government and defend the Republic 
- perhaps this time without the restraining - on immigration and on the right of 
influence of the Opposition front bench. Two particular lines of attack 
Irishmen to vote in the UK, on both of which the MPs laid stress - could also embarrass Mr. Maudling. 
Mr. Maudling may of course be approached direct. But as Sir Alec Douglas-Home is under some obligation to 
give Chichester-Clark a reply on the point about the adjournment debate, I should be grateful for an indication of Mr. Maudling’s views, and indeed of those to whom I am copying this letter

Cabinet Office, Andrew at the Ministry of Defence and Davies in the Lord President’s Office.

COPY 
Incidents in the last 24 hours There were comparatively few incidents during the period. The 
most serious was the murder of an off-duty soldier of the.UDR Private Wilson of D Company, 6 Battalion - in his home near Calledon (about 3 miles from the border). The 3 gunmen who shot him then stole his rifle, but omitted to take the bolt and magazine. Although there have been previous attacks on off-duty members of the UDR, this is the first case of one being murdered; the 2 UDR men killed previously were on duty at the.time. Private Wilson was a Protestant. 2. 
A civilian - Anthony Nolan - was found dead of gun-shot wounds 
in the Markets area of Belfast, with indications that he might have first of all been tortured. 3. 
In Londonderry shots were fired on 4 occasions at military posts, 
without casualties, and a nail bomb was thrown at a police station. There were 3 fairly small explosions in Belfast, in one of which in the Queens’ Arcade in the centre of the city 
- 21 civilians sustained 
superficial injuries. In Lurgan a bomb caused extensive damage to a bar; and in Co. Londonderry a bus was high-jacked and set on fire by 3 armed men. 4. 
There were 19 arrests of wanted persons and 5 routine arrests. 
One of the wanted arrests, McNally, was the OC of A Company of the Brady IRA, based at Andersonstown. Arms Raid in the Republic of Ireland 5. 
At Drogheda, about 30 miles north of Dublin, armed men raided a 
reserve Army training centre and, after an exchange of shots, made off with 2 SMGs, 15 rifles and some ammunition. Crumlin Road prison escape 6. 
It was reported on the radio this morning that the IRA had

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 307 DECEMBER 197l 
Incidents in the last 24 hours The period was again dominated by a simple incident: this ti 
a massive fire in a block comprising carpet and shirt factories in the Dublin Road area of Belfast. The fire was started by two bombs planted by two armed men who walked into the building at 2.15 p.m. Later, a wall in an adjoining Salvation Army hostel collapsed, killing one woman and injuring other members of the Salvation Army staff. 2. 
There were further disturbances in Londonderry. In the Creggan area, the throwing of petrol and nail bombs - which had commenced 
during the small hours - continued, and shots by the Army are thought to have hit a further two terrorists (in addition to the three gunmen and one petrol bomber mentioned in yesterday’s report). Throughout the day, gangs of hooligans roamed through the Bogside stoning Army units, who fired baton rounds to disperse them; and there was intermittent sniper fire, which caused no military casualties and which was returned. 3. 
Near Rosslea, a mobile patrol came under fire and one soldier 
was hit in the thigh. The fire was returned. 4. 
There were 7 arrests of wanted persons. 5. A lighting failure occurred at Long Kesh internment camp. The 
occupants of one compound at first refused to obey instructions to move indoors, but changed their minds after an Army detachment was called in to confront them, before any physical force had to be used.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 29 6 DECEMBER 1971 
Incidents in the last 72 hours The weekend was over-shadowed by a massive explosion in a bar 
in the Catholic area of New Lodge, in which 15 people were killed and 13 injured. It is not at present known who was responsible; the likelier explanation is thought to be that the explosion took place accidentally while a quantity of bomb-material was in transit, intended for use elsewhere 
- but the possibilities can not be ruled 
out that it might have been a deliberate act either by Protestant extremists or conceivably by the IRA. During the hours which followed this explosion, communal feeling ran high in the area and a number of shots were fired at the security forces who were keeping the rival crowds apart, resulting in 2 soldiers and 2 policemen being wounded (one, Major J. Snow of 2RRF, suffering a serious head wound). 2. 
Over the period as a whole, the number of bombings was well 
down on the previous weekend, but the number of shootings slightly up. In Belfast, apart from the Saturday night out-breaks mentioned above, there were 4 shooting incidents on Friday (in one of which a NCO who was one of a patrol waiting to escort children home from school in the Ardoyne suffered a serious chest wound) and 2 on Sunday, when there were no casualties. There were also 4 armed robberies on Friday. 3. 
In Londonderry there were frequent eruptions of rioting by 
hooligans throughout the weekend, sparked mainly by searches for arms in the Bogside area on Friday night and in the Creggan area early on Monday morning; baton rounds and CS were used to disperse the mob whenever it threatened to get out of hand. The Creggan search, which yielded 5 carbines and a shot-gun, was followed by several shooting incidents - in the course of which 3 gunmen and one petrol-bomber are

NOTE OF HOME SECRETARY’S MEETING WITH MR. FAULKNER AT THE HOME OFFICE ON MONDAY 6TH DECEMBER 
Present: 
Home Secretary Mr. Woodfield Mr. Angel 
Mr. Faulkner Mr. Ramsay 
Mr. Faulkner said that he would be very surprised if the I.R.A. were able 
to keep up their terrorist campaign in Belfast beyond February. On the political front, Mr. Faulkner found unanimous support within his own Party from both left and right. He would be confident of the outcome of an election if one were held now. Paisley was losing support all over the Province. It was important that ideas such as the proposal that a united Ireland should come about within 15 years should not gain currency. They would only encourage the I.R.A. to carry on. Public opinion in Great Britain needed to accept that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the United Kingdom. Mr. Faulkner believed that he still had substantial Catholic support though this could not be vocal because of intimidation. He stressed that the political initiatives which had been taken had not yet had an opportunity to work. Mr. Faulkner said that Mr. McGurk, the proprietor of the pub which was 
blown up at the week-end, had been interviewed by the police in hospital and had said that there were no strangers in the bar on the night of the explosion. The army also discovered that the bomb went off on the ground floor. Both point strongly to the likelihood that the bomb was carried by the I.R.A. rather than Protestant extremists. Mr. Faulkner had asked the R.U.C. to find out whether anything was known about the associations of the people who were killed or injured.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 28 
3 DECEMBER 1971 Incidents in the last 24 hours The period was fairly quiet 
- the main event of security 
significance being the escape of 3 detained IRA members from Crumlin Road prison in Belfast. Their absence was apparently first noticed during a roll call at 9.30 p.m.; the Army received their first reports of it at about 10.30 p.m., and confirmation half an hour later. Despite road blocks and patrols, there has so far been no signof the escapees. Two of the 3 are considered to be among the most dangerous of the IRA members so far arrested (details below) and it is a very serious matter if they have been allowed to get away. 2. 
During the period there were 8 explosions and 5 shooting 
incidents. Two of the explosions took place in Belfast, at a hotel and in an office block 
- 3 civilians being slightly wounded in the 
first case and 9 in the second. There were also 3 minor civilian casualties following 2 explosions in a shop and a hotel in Newry; while 2 shops in Londonderry were bombed, without casualties. At Omagh an explosion in a transformer damaged the ’electricity supply to half the city. The remaining explosion was in the Bogside area. Also in the Bogside area, a search uncovered a large stock of gelignite and nail bombs; this search gave rise to minor disturbances, with 3 nail bombs being thrown at the military. There were also some minor disturbances in Belfast. 3. 
The main shooting incident concerned a party of 42 Commando RM 
who were engaged in humping approved roads. Automatic fire came from across the border, causing one minor casualty; the fire was returned and two gunmen are thought to have been hit. 4. 
There were 46 arrests of wanted persons.. 
Escape from Crumlin Road prison 5. 
Two of the 3 escapees are former leaders of the No. 3 Brady Group /based

December, 1971 Crumlin Road Escapers Your letter of 29 November suggested that we should 
seek extradition of the Crumlin Road escapers. We had already prompted this action. It is for the 
RUC to take it, and I enclose a copy of UKREP’s telegram No. 21 of 26 November recording that Shillington is going ahead. 
Other points in the telegram which may not be selfevident are: 
(a) the "guidance in White’s letter of 22 October to Steele." This is adequately summarised in paragraph 4 of the telegram. Hitherto the RUC, considering (not without reason) that requests for extradition are fruitless, have not bothered to keep the record straight by pursuing all the justifiable cases; 
(b) Extradition of a torturer (paragraph 3 of UKREP’s reply). Our thought here was that if the Irish proposed to take us to Strasbourg (we did not at the time know for certain that they would), and if they were to allege brutality, torture, etc., 
it would be no bad thing to be able to reply that torture did indeed take place in Northern Ireland; that it was practised by the IRA and not the British Army; and that those guilty of acts of torture continued to enjoy the protection of the Irish authorities despite our efforts to bring them to justice. 
I am sending copies of this letter to Andrew (Ministry of Defence), Angel (Home Office) and Norbury (Cabinet Office).

153/44/47 NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 27 
2 DECEMBER 1971 Incidents in the last 24 hours The period was fairly quiet. There were 5 explosions in all 
4 in Londonderry (resulting in minor injuries to 6 civilians) and one in Belfast. The latter involved 3 armed men placing a bomb in a shop in the Smithfield area, which injured 4 civilians when it exploded; and a 61 year old employee was shot in the shoulder by the terrorists as they escaped. A paint store, also in the Smithfield area, was set on fire. 2. 
Two other shooting incidents occurred inLondonderry: a single 
shot’ was fired at a military post; and troops opened fire on a car so 
which failed to stop when ordered to do/, possibly injuring one of the occupants. A gun-barrel had been seen protruding from a window of the car. Outside the towns, patrols of 42 Commando RM encountered 2 attempted ambushes; one near Coalisland, where automatic fire hit a military vehicle and caused one minor casualty; the other near Newton Hamilton, Co. Armagh, when 6 gunmen armed with rifles and a LMG opened fire from positions clearly within the Republic. The fire was returned with one possible hit on a gunman; there were no military casualties. 3. 
There were 9 arrests of wanted persons and l7 routine arrests. 
Murder of Private Benner 4. 
The car belonging to Private Benner, who was found dead on 29 
November, and in which he is believed to have travelled to Dundalk (south of the border) just before his death, has been discovered near Forkill, Co. Armagh. At the time of its discovery there were reports of gunmen moving in the area across the border; the Gardai and the Eire Army were contacted and co-operated readily in ensuring that the area was clear, before the car was removed. 5. 
It is not yet clear whether the murder of Private Benner took /place

Border Control (GEN 47(71) 6) 
closures alone can achieve little. 
The paper reaffirms the view that in purely military terms road In effect, the answer to the question put 
in your minute of 3 November to the Secretary of State for Defence about the benefits so far gained from the cratering policy is that they are largely intangible. A prior question, therefore, is whether the blocking of some 85 unapproved roads is a basis for the "sound long-term plan" referred to in paragraph 4 of the paper. The measure has no doubt been widely regarded as further evidence that the Army is on the side of the Protestants; but a change of policy now, except in the context of some wider political moves in which the Republic give us some positive help with the security problem, would probably have more disadvantages than advantages. 2. 
Given the basic policy, the progressive improvements advocated 
by the Defence Secretary appear sound. One relatively minor point might be worth examination. 
In the hi-jacking crisis last year great claims were 
made for the ability of dogs to detect explosives; and one particularly impressive experiment was reported. Presumably the Ministry of Defence are drawing on the resources of the Department of Trade and Industry, who instituted a small dog-training programme (costing £15, 000) in October, 1970 As to ’humping’, some examples are already to be found, not on the Border but on either side of vulnerable points such as police stations, where it certainly serves to slow traffic down considerably and to reduce the risk of raids from fast-moving vehicles. 3. 
The Meeting may be content to leave the progressive implementation 
of the measures listed in paragraph 9 of the paper to the Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Defence, except that the last measure (closure of concession roads), which clearly has major implications for the Republic, should probably be considered by GEN 47 after the further study referred to in the memorandum has been completed and before any closures are actually effected.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 2 6 1 
DECEMBER 1971 Incidents in the 24 hours last The period was comparatively quiet. There were 5 shooting incidents in all: 
2 in Belfast (in one of which a soldier was slightly wounded), 2 in Londonderry and one on the border at Killeter. In the latter, which occurred while 3 Army vehicles were recovering a burnt-out GPO van which had been previously highjacked, 40 rounds of ammunition were fired at the Army from the Republic side of the border; the fire was returned, and one gunman is thought to have been hit. 2. There were 3 explosions (one in a shop in Belfast, and 2 affecting public utilities in the Londonderry area) and 3 armed robberies of post offices (one in Londonderry, which was unsuccessful, and 2 in country districts). A Customs caravan at Belleek was set on fire. 3. There were 7 arrests of wanted persons and 10 routine arrests. Murder victim found at Crossmaglen 4. The youngman found dead at Crossmaglen on 30 November, who was originally thought to be a civilian, has been identified as a soldier - Private Benner - of 3 Queens, who are stationed at Ballykihler Co. Down, but are currently deployed to Belfast. Private Benner was an Irish-born Roman Catholic, whose mother used to live at Dundulk - just across the border from Northern Ireland 
- and be had mad

The Rt Hon Edward Heath, MP, 10 Downing Street, Whitehall. London SW1. 
I am enclosing a letter just received from Alex Lyon MP in which he asks me to construe our Terms of Reference. 
My colleagues and I feel that it is quite wrong for him to make the request and that it would be equally wrong for us to accede to it, otherwise than in the Report itself. Our inclination therefore was to ignore it. However, having regard to the threat in the last paragraph of the letter to take the matter up with Ministers, we thought that you should see it in case you would wish to reply yourself. For your information, we are taking evidence as to whether the methods in question transgress not only domestic law but our international obligations. This we consider is within our Terms of Reference. How far however and in what way we shall deal with the matter in our Report is a matter for further discussion.

From: Alex Lyon.M.P. 20th December, 1971. Dear Lord Parker, I am very concerned that the terms of 
reference of your Committee do not appear to allow you to deal with the problem of whether the methods of interrogation, disclosed in the Compton Report, are within the existing law. As far as I have been able to discover 
there is no legal authority which would allow men to be assaulted in the way that is authorised in the methods of interrogation and it would, therefore, appear that the Ministry of Defence have no answer to either a criminal prosecution or a civil action in the Northern Irish courts. Before you could decide upon the principle on which prisoners might be interrogated it would surely have to be determined what was permissible in law and what was not. 
I would be grateful if you would confirm 
that the question of the legal power of Ministers to allow such methods is not within your terms of reference when I can take up the matter again with the Minister. 
Yours sincerely,

About the terms of reference of your Committee, which I have considered with the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary. We agree that the terms as drafted might 
be read as covering ordinary police enquiries Which as you rightly say is not the intention. On balance, however, we have decided to adopt your second suggestion 
- that you should act on 
the terms as announced, but take the opportunity of your Report to remove any misapprehension about their interpretation.

MO 19/3/6 13 December, 1971. Peter Gregson sent Robert Andrew a copy of his letter 
of 6th December to you about Lord Parker’s letter to the Prime Minister about the terms of reference of his Committee on Interrogation Procedures. 
The Defence Secretary agrees that the Committee’s 
understanding of the scope of their Enquiry is correct but he is not convinced that it is either necessary or desirable to amend their terms of reference. 
The terms of reference in 
their revised form are not, as Lord Parker himself admits, very elegant. 
something would still have to be said in the introduction to the Committee’s Report to explain why they were different from the Committee’s original remit which was announced by the Home and Defence Secretaries in their statements to the Commons and Lords on 16th November and which has since been further publicised in the Press statement which the Committee issued on 3rd December. 
More importantly, if they were adopted, In these circumstances the Defence Secretary feels that 
it would probably be wiser to leave the Committee’s terms of reference as they are, and to take up Lord Parker’s own suggestion, that the Committee should include in the introduction to their report a paragraph explaining how they have interpreted their terms of reference. 
I am sanding copies of this letter to Gregson and Norbury and to Sir Dick White. (R.A. CUSTIS) G.L. Angel, Esq.

THE PARKER ENQUIRY 1. 
You will remember that I minuted you on December 6 about 
the position of Sir Dick White in relation to the Parker Enquiry. 2. 
I am glad to be able to report that following a further 
discussion with Sir Dick White I think that the conflict of evidence to which I referred in my previous minute has been largely resolved. 
3. Briefly the position I have now reached with Sir Dick White 
is as follows: a. 
When Sir Dick White appears before the Parker 
Committee on Thursday I will go with him. b. 
Sir Dick White intends to start off by explaining 
the difference between the interrogation of prisoners-ofwar and spies, where one has a lot of time for the interrogation process and custom-built facilities for the purpose. This is very different from the operational situation where speed can often be of the essence and where the accommodation available is often anything but custom-built. All this I think is helpful and entirely in line with the evidence we shall be giving. 
c. If, as I think is very probable, Lord Parker refers 
to his conversation with the Prime Minister, at which the Prime Minister referred to the paper which Sir Dick White had prepared as a guide to the future, Sir Dick White has agreed with me that the line he should take would be as follows. It was true that following the Compton Report he had been asked to consider whether there should be changes in the way the techniques in question were used for the future. He had provisionally reached the conclusion that in the conditions prevailing in Northern Ireland it might suffice for the future if the techniques in question were used for security purposes only. He would emphasise, however, that this had merely been a provisional suggestion

COMMITTEE ON INTERROGATION PROCEDURES 
The Rt Hon Edward Heath MBE MP Prime Minister 
6 December 1971 Very many thanks for your letter of 2 December. I did so 
appreciate what you said in the last paragraph. The Committee have now met and have considered the terms of 
reference as given by the Home Secretary in the House of Commons and as set out in your letter to me of the 18 November. 
covering ordinary police inquiries into crime. 
We are a little concerned that some might read these terms as Terrorism no doubt 
connotes violence and violence for political ends but this might occur under ordinary conditions, e.g. violence by some body such as the Angry Brigade. 
We feel sure that you do not intend us to cover police 
interrogation under ordinary conditions but only interrogation under emergency conditions short of war such as prevail in Northern Ireland, e.g. where persons can be lawfully detained without trial. 
In these circumstances we would welcome a slight amendment to make the terms read as follows: 
"To consider whether, and if so in what respects - under conditions in which persons suspected of terrorism can be lawfully detained without trial in the traditional Courts - the procedures currently authorised for the interrogation of such persons and for their custody while subject to interrogation require amendment." 
This is, I fear, a little cumbersome but we have tried to keep as 
far as possible to what the Home Secretary said. If however any difficulty might be thought to attach to an amendment, 
we would be quite prepared to act on the original terms, stating in our Report what our understanding of them is 
coincides with your understanding. The Lord President has kindly agreed that we may use his office as 
an accommodation address and has provided notepaper. - always of course on the assumption that this

D/Min/RB/472 December, 1971 We are in a dilemma over the services of Sir Edmund Compton 
who, in addition to all his other duties, is chairman of the Defence Services Medical Inquiry, He wrote to Lord Balniel on 5th November saying that in view of his Northern Ireland tasks, which looked like continuing, he did not have the time to carry out his DSMI tasks as well and therefore offered his resignation. 
We delayed replying to this (with his knowledge) at the 
time since, as you know, a question mark developed over whether Sir Edmund Compton would in fact be used for investigating further allegations in Northern Ireland even if it were decided to set up a standing body for this purpose. The matter has now drifted on for some weeks and no decision has been made on whether such a body should be set up -- 
the Prime Minister is, I understand, inclined against it - and consequently the question 
of Air Edmund Compton’s further services in Northern Ireland still remains in the air. 
The Defence Services Medical Inquiry is an important 
committee whose recommendations will have a very considerable bearing on the long term structure of the medical, nursing and dental services in the Armed Forces. There will be considerable difficulty in finding a replacement for Sir Edmund Compton and we would very much like him to stay on as chairman if this is possible and provided he is willing to do so. However, it would obviously not make much sense if we were to try to persuade him to remain if there was any likelihood that his services, after all, may be required in Northern Ireland. 
reason or another but I would be grateful for your advice in this respect. I am writing to you since Sir Edmund

As things stand at the moment this seems unlikely for one Compton has

Ref. A0837 PRIME MINISTER 
Northern Ireland 
Standing Body for Investigation of Allegations (GEN 47(71) 4) 
The Meeting gave some preliminary consideration to this 
memorandum on 22 November; but a few new points have supervened in the interval:(a) The Police Authority are now thought to be vexed that no action has been taken on their recommendation. 
(b) The Government of the Irish Republic have decided to take us to Strasbourg. To set up a body on the lines envisaged might help our case; on the other hand it could now be construed as a concession to the Republic’s decision and a belated admission of an uneasy conscience. 
(c) A Board of Visitors is being set up at Long Kesh. This, however, is a separate issue, as the memorandum points out, since a Board would be concerned only with the treatment of internees while they were at Long Kesh. 
2. The appointment of a standing body might serve a useful purpose as 
a safety valve and afford some protection for the security forces themselves, even though the proven complaints are likely to be only a minute fraction of the wild allegations which the IRA propaganda machine is capable of pouring out. 3. 
If it is decided to set up standing machinery, however, the point at 
(b) on page 2 is important and should be explicitly endorsed by Ministers. As regards the other questions on page 2, the earlier meeting decided provisionally that one man was better than three, and that there is a strong case for limiting jurisdiction to complaints made by people who allege that they were maltreated. The question whether the Westminster Government should reserve a power to remit cases to the body is more arguable. Although this might have the advantage of flexibility, we should be under constant pressure to remit particular cases. 
(Your latest exchange with 
the Cardinal illustrates this). Would it not be best to be ready to change the terms of reference if a special situation arose?

2 December 1971 Thank you for your letter of 24 November. 
As you know the names of the other two members of your Committee, Mr. Boyd-Carpenter arid Lord Gardiner, have now been announced. No doubt you will be in touch with us again about your suggestion for a possible change in the terms of reference, when you have had a chance to discuss this with your colleagues. I know that your task will not be an easy one. It is good of you to take on this burden. 
The Rt. Hon. Lord Parker of Waddington.

CONFIDENTIAL. TO F L A S H FCO TELEGRAM NUMBER 640 OF 3 DECEMBER, 
YOUR TEL NO 302. FOLLOWING FOR PRIVATE SECRETARY. 
1. THE TAOISEACH WILL BE HAPPY TO CALL ON THE PRIME MINISTER AT 3.O P.M. ON MONDAY DEC 6TH. 
2. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS DOTTY, BUT I HAVE HAD TO HAVE A CONSIDERABLE NEGOTIATION WITH MCCANN ABOUT THE MODALITIES. THE POINT IS THAT WHAT IS NORMAL ELSEWHERE IS, AS ALWAYS, EXCEPTIONAL HERE, AND MCCANN AS A FORMER AMBASSADOR IN LONDON INSISTS THAT FORMER TAOISEACHS HAVE PAID FREQUENT VISITS TO LONDON WITHOUT GOING NEAR HNG, AND THE SITUATION IN THE DAIL BEING WHAT IT IS THIS CALL IS LIKELY TO BE REGARDED AS A SIGNIFICANT EXCEPTION, ETC., 
ETC, 
3. FOR THIS REASON THEY WOULD PREFER THE TERM "" FORMAL’’ TO ’’COURTESY’’ CALL, WITHOUT GIVING IT MUCH IF ANY PUBLICITY IN ADVANCE. THERE IS INCIDENTALLY A PRACTICAL REASON FOR THIS, AS MR LYNCH’S MANY ENEMIES IN THE I R A MIGHT WELL PRODUCE A HOSTILE DEMONSTRATION OUTSIDE NO 10 IF GIVEN TIME TO ORGANIZE. (IF THEY MET IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THIS PROBLEM OF COURSE WOULD NOT ARISE.) 
A. I HAVE SUGGESTED TO MCCANN THAT DETAILS OF PLACE ETC SHOULD BE FIXED WITH O’SULLIVAN. MAY I SUGGEST THAT NEWS DEPARTMENT IF AGREED WETHER MR LYNCH IS GOINF TO MEET THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD TAKE THE LINE THAT A CALL WOULD BE NORMAL BUT BE IMPRECISE ABUT TIME AND PLACE, AND MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS IS NEITHER POLITICAL NOR A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE MAIN TALKS.
