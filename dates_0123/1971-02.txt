26 February, 1971 You asked me in your letter of 23 February about the 
letter to Mr. Lynch referred to in Dublin telegram No. 54 and also for our comments on Mr. Lynch’s proposals for economic co-operation with Northern Ireland. This latter point, if I may, I will leave for a later reply: the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary saw Dr. Hillery yesterday and the general subject of North-South relations was discussed. He would like to think about the matters raised and consider the best way forward. 
The conversation between the Ambassador in Dublin and 
Mr. Lynch took place on instructions, although the exact level of the approach was left to Peck’s discretion. You will remember that at Cabinet on 9 February the point was made that although Mr. Lynch had condemned violence in Northern Ireland, the Government of the Irish Republic should be urged to take a stronger stand against the IRA; and in the Prime Minister’s summing up, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary was invited to consider whether any action to this end could usefully be taken with the Irish Government. Before that meeting, Peck had been in London for consultations and the possibility of an approach to the Irish Government on this subject was canvassed with him by officials of the Department. Peck later discussed the matter with Sir Alec himself. It was on this basis that Peck raised the matter on 11 February. 
The level of approach was also left to Peck’s 
discretion. He has told us that he is deliberately circumspect in his contacts with the Taoisech because he does not wish to lend substance to the accusations to which Mr. Lynch is exposed that he listens too much to the British. On the other hand, Mr. Lynch himself has always shown great readiness to welcome the Ambassador: indeed, Peck, when calling upon Dr. Hillery, is frequently taken along the corridor "to have a word with Jack". Thus mutual confidence between the two men has been built up and /Mr. Lynch

PRIME MINISTER NORTHERN IRELAND 
Thank you for your minute of 16th February. The record of our meeting at Chequers is perhaps a 
little condensed in the reference to the R.U.C’s Special Branch. It is true that there are one or two members of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch in Northern Ireland at the present moment helping with the investigation of specific crimes, but the further help which I said that the Commissioner was ready to give is not primarily Special Branch help, nor indeed is the Special Branch in the Commissioner’s opinion in need of reinforcement. He has had senior officers looking at the Branch, and thinks that it is now pretty good. The officers he is sending over to Northern Ireland are mainly from the C.I.D., in response to a request from the Chief Constable of the R.U.C. for help in investigating a murder and any other crimes which may prove to be linked with that murder. It is likely that the officers sent over (none of them will be in uniform) are likely to build up to a fairly substantial total. Nevertheless, I am not sure that we have a reliable 
picture of the efficiency of the security and intelligence network as a whole in Northern Ireland. We certainly get conflicting reports from the various interested parties. I appreciate that the Secretary of State for Defence is

CONFIDENTIAL TO PRIORITY DUBLIN TELNO. 42 OF 26/2 AND TO UKREP BELFAST 1. DR HILLERY CALLED ON ME ON 25 FEBRUARY. HIS MAIN POINTS OF CONCERN WERE: A. THE POSSIBILITY THAT EXTREME UNIONISM WAS REGAINING INFLUENCE, AND THAT THE CHEQUERS MEETING PRESAGED A SLOWING OF MOMENTUM IN THE REFORM PROGRAMME. I SAID HE COULD DISMISS THAT THOUGHT FROM HIS MIND: ALL DISCUSSION HAD BEEN ABOUT GOING FORWARDS, NOT BACKWARDS. B. THE NEED TO CONSULT THE MINORITY AND TO GIVE THEM A VOICE IN THE ADMINISTRATION, AT LEAST AT LOWER LEVELS. THE USUAL FORMS OF DEMOCRACY COULD NOT MEET THE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF NORTHERN IRELAND. PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION WAS ONE POSSIBILITY (HE EMPHASISED THAT HE WAS SPEAKING PERSONALLY AND QUOTE THINKING ALOUD UNQUOTE). C. THE NEED FOR SOME PRACTICAL RESPONSE TO MR LYNCH’S ’OLIVE BRANCH’ SPEECHES ON NORTH SOUTH COOPERATION. 2. I SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS DESIRABLE TO CRACK DOWN HARDER ON THE IRA, AND THAT, E.G., TRAINING CAMPS COULD BE HARASSED BY POLICE RAIDS. THE PROGRESS OF REFORMS IN NORTHERN IRELAND HAD ENDED ANY EXCUSE FOR VIOLENCE. DR HILLERY AGREED THAT HARSH MEASURES AGAINST THE IRA IN NORTHERN IRELAND SHOULD BE POLITICALLY POSSIBLE IF ACCOMPANIED BY REASSURANCES TO THE MINORITY THAT THIS DID NOT MEAN A RETURN TO EXTREME UNIONISM. HE WAS LESS CERTAIN ABOUT ACTION IN THE REPUBLIC, THOUGH HE DID NOT EXCLUDE IT. 3. DR HILLERY MENTIONED BRIEFLY THE RIFLE CLUBS TO ILLUSTRATE HIS ARGUMENTS ABOUT REASSURING THE MINORITY AND CONTRASTED ARMS SEARCHES FOR THE MINORITY WITH THE NUMBER OF LEGAL WEAPONS HELD BY THE MAJORITY. HE SHOWED CONCERN LEST BURROUGHS MIGHT NOT BE REPLACED (I REASSURED HIM ON THIS): SPOKE OF THE PROBLEMS OF BRITISH TROOPS ACCIDENTALLY CROSSING THE BORDER: AND WONDERED HOW TO ERADICATE CROSS BORDER SUSPICIONS BY, E.G., EXTENDING RTE COVERAGE IN NORTHERN IRELAND. HE CONCLUDED THAT THE IRISH GOVERNMENT AND MR LYNCH IN PARTICULAR WERE TRYING THE NOVEL POLICY, IN ANGLO-IRISH RELATIONS, OF MUTUAL TRUST: IF THIS FAILED IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS.

PRIME MINISTER PM/71/21 
Northern Ireland I have seen the Defence Secretary’s minute M019/3 of 
19 February in reply to your minute M8/71 of 15 February. 2. 
I agree with Lord Carrington that continuous and active 
intelligence is the key to effective action against the I.R.A. I note that you have called for a monthly report on this. 3. 
I am pursuing through our Embassy in Dublin the question 
of greater co-operation from the Irish Republic in maintaining border surveillance. And there may also be an opportunity to raise this when I see Dr. Hillery on 25 February.

23 February, 1971 Dr. Hillery is calling upon the Secretary of State 
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on Thursday, 25 February, at 4.00 p.m. 
You will recall that, when the Prime Minister met 
Mr. Lynch in New York last October they agreed to meet again some time in the course of 1971. We shall brief Sir Alec not to raise this idea with Dr. Hillery himself but to say, if Dr. Hillery raises it, that Dr. Hillery’s present visit will take the pressure off for the moment; that it is better to avoid the season of marches (Easter to August, approximately), when any meeting at Prime Minister level might be misinterpreted as a "crisis summit"; and that therefore we think we should forget the matter for the moment and look to an autumn date. 
Should Mr. Lynch pay a visit to London for other 
reasons (it is believed he recently temporised on an invitation to a Centenary match at Twickenham in April) we would, of course, have to think again.

FOLLOWING ARE EXTRACTS FROM THE TAOISEACH’S SPEECH ON 20 FEBRUARY DEALING WITH THE NORTH. FULL TEXT FOLLOWS BY BAG A. BUT BENEATH THE TURMOIL AND DISTURBANCE WHICH UNHAPPILY CONTINUE, IT WOULD BE WISE ALSO TO NOTICE THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES WHICH ARE TAKING PLACE. WHiLE MISTAKES HAVE BEEN MADE, BOTH POLITICAL AND TACTICAL ESPECIALLY IN BELFAST, THE MOVEMENT TO LEGISLATIVE REFORM HAS ALSO CONTINUED AND WE LOOK TO THE DOWNING STREET DECLARATION WHICH GUARANTEES EQUALITY OF TREATMENT TO EVERYONE IN THE NORTH WITH OUT REGARD TO RELIGIOUS CONSIDERATIONS. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE AND A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE FROM THE SITUATION WHICH EXISTED UP TO AUGUST, 1969. IMPATIENCE IS CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDABLE ON THE PART OF THE MINORITY AND IT IS EASY TO PROVOKE A DEPRESSED COMMUNITY INTO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE: BUT IT REMAINS THE TASK OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH TO DO ALL POSSIBLE TO CALM THE SITUATION SO THAT THE BENEFITS OF REFORM CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE DELAY. 
B.INDEED THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES OF COOPERATION BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH IN ECONOMIC UNDERTAKINGS TO THE MUTUAL BENEFIT OF LOTH PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. A RECENT EXAMPLE WAS THE PREFERENTIAL TARIFF CONCESSIONS THAT WE UNILATERALLY EXTENDED TO A RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL GOODS FROM NORTHERN IRELAND FIRMS. MORE RECENTLY WHEN THE ANGLO-IRISH FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED, IT PROVIDED, AT OUR INSTIGATION; FOR MORE FAVOURABLE TARIFF TREATMENT FOR A RANGE OF NORTH OF IRELAND INDUSTRIAL GOODS THAN FOR BRITISH GOODS.

MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 
MO 19/3 PRIM MINISTER 
NORTHERN IRELAND I agree with the point you make in your minute 
of 15th February that we must vary our strategic dispositions according to the current assessment of the situation and objectives in Northern Ireland if we are to achieve our aims and use our available Security Forces to the best effect. 
You can be sure that we 
have this problem very much in mind both in the Ministry of Defence and in Headquarters Northern Ireland. 
2. The problem is essentially one of deciding what 
proportions of our total available effort should be directed at any one time towards deterring and if necessary stamping out any riots or disturbances in the cities; towards isolating, seeking out and bringing to trial the extremist ringleaders, and capturing their arsenals; and towards protective and deterrent operations in the rural areas and along the border. careful riot to over-react to any one threat. 
We have to be What the 
Security Forces in Northern Ireland therefore try to do is retain enough flexibility in their operations to deal with a variety of threats, as best they can, within the available force levels. 
3. It is true that at present the IRA are able 
frequently to take the initiative; but this stems not nearly so much from their use of the border for two-way traffic as from the scope they have for operating,within Northern Ireland, from urban bases in the Catholic areas, made relatively secure by intimidation and even murder. This is not to say that the existence of a sanctuary in EIRE with an unmarked land border 300 miles long enabing reinforcement or withdrawal by stealth at minimum risk - 
is not a considerable advantage to them. 
But the Security Forces would not be able to maintain close and continuous surveillance of the entire border

1. MAJOR CHICHESTER-CLARK WAS CONFIDENT ABOUT THE UNIONIST MEETING ON 1 MARCH. DIFFICULTIES OF DEALING WITH THE IRA WITHOUT ALIENATING THE ROMAN CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IN WHOSE AREAS THEY OPERATE WERE RECOGNISED BY ALL PRESENT, AS WAS THE IRA AIM OF PROVOKING A ROMAN CATHOLIC/PROTESTANT CONFRONTATION. 
2. ECONOMIC PROBLEMS LED TO A DISCUSSION OF A POSSIBLE CONFERENCE ON N.I. DESIGNED TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AMONGST THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND ESPECIALLY INVESTORS. THIS, IF IT MATERIALISED, WOULD NOT BE A CONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCE: IT WAS NOT ENVISAGED THAT THE REPUBLIC WOULD BE INVOLVED. 
3. CHICHESTER-CLARK ACKNOWLEDGED CERTAIN ATTRACTIONS IN PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION BUT THOUGHT ANY CHANGE UNLIKELY BEFORE THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION IN 1974. 
4. YOU MAY IF YOU WISH INFORM THE IRISH AUTHORITIES THAT THE DISCUSSION RANGED WIDELY BUT NO DRAMATIC SOLUTIONS WERE PROPOSED OR ADOPTED. YOU MAY MENTION THE POINTS IN PARAGRAPH 1 ABOVE AND THE FACT THAT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WERE DISCUSSED. THE REMAINDER IS FOR YOUR OWN INFORMATION ONLY, INCLUDING A POSSIBILITY OF A CONFERENCE.

Chichester-Clark had nothing very positive to suggest 
"For your own information, though 
to be and was kept as a general discussion of the situation - he seemed confident of his own position and not unduly gloomy about the prospect. He obviously felt that the program of reform had taken a good deal of the heat out of the inter-community antagonism and that what remained was a hard core of IRA extremism. There was a long way to go before community relations got back to the level of two years ago, but he did not despair of making that

PRIME MINISTER You will remember the letters which Mr. Robin Chichester- 
Clark and Mr. Stratton Mills sent to you about the Northern Ireland situation before Christmas. You have never replied to them but on the day you left for the Far East, Christopher Roberts wrote to each of them on your behalf saying that you hoped to have a word with them on your return. 
When you returned this was followed soon after 
by Lord Carrington’s visit and then by your own invitation to Major Chichester-Clark and so it seemed best to review the situation after the latter’s visit. Since they wrote the situation has changed considerably and it is unlikely that they have the same anxieties about "softness" and "benevolent neutrality". No doubt you will see them in the House and one way of disposing with the matter would be simply to make some comment that you hoped you would run into them but that the situation had, of course, changed considerably since they wrote in December. But if you feel you owe them a proper meeting, we should need to decide whether this should be arranged before or after the Home Secretary’s Visit to Northern Ireland on 5 March. How would you like this handled?

17 February 1971 Thank you for sending me your note of the weekend meeting 
at Chequers. The Home Secretary has suggested two amendments. The first is in line 14 of page 7: he would substitute the word "party" for "community". The second is at the bottom of page 8 where he suggests the final sentence should begin "It would be desirable if the Conference could include representatives of the political parties, but it should not degenerate 
.... ". Subject 
to these two amendments there is no objection to sending a copy of the note to Brian Cummings in Northern Ireland. 
In a separate letter of 15 February you refer to the dis- 
cussion of internment. The Home Secretary has commented that he himself told Major Chichester-Clark that the British Government had authorised the putting in hand of a contingency study of the practical problems of internment.

There was to be a special meeting of

12th February 1971 Visit of Major Chichester-Clark I attach a note, which has been approved by 
the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence, about the question of internment. 
You 
will see that the last paragraph of the brief suggests that the Prime Minister might take the opportunity of this week-end’s discussion to inform Major ChichesterClark that H.M.G. has authorised the putting in hand of a contingency study of the practical problems of internment.

INTERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND 1. 
the Chief Constable - Major Chichester-Clark has been publicly asked from time to time 
in recent months whether he is contemplating internment. The standard reply which he has evolved is that his security advisers 
- to recommend it he would not hesitate to act. the GOC and 
do not recommend it at present, but if they were This is not an entirely 
satisfactory formula in that it might be read as an abdication by the Prime Minister of political responsibility for the decision. Home Office doubts on this score have been conveyed privately to the Secretary to the Cabinet and it is known that both the former GOC and the present Chief Constable feel that they are being publicly placed in a somewhat invidious position. There is however a clear and firm understanding between the two governments, frequently renewed and kept in good repair, that there could be no question of internment being adopted without full consultation with HMG. 
2. If internment were thought necessary the Northern Ireland Government 
would be in considerable practical difficulties. The advice of the security forces is that the numbers involved would be something between 350 and 450. 
There is no suitable prison building which could be 
used. The main prison in Belfast is full, and anyway being in the Crumlin Road is in an area which would present serious additional security problems. The only other prison in Northern Ireland, in Armagh, could only hold a fraction of the numbers 
- perhaps 80 - is dangerously near 
the border and in a part of the town which makes it particularly difficult to guard. High turrets completely bullet proof would have to be erected inside the prison and despite their protection would be a perpetual target for snipers. 
3. Internment camps could be got ready elsewhere in Northern Ireland 
notably in Rathlin Island, off the north coast, but the preparations would be obvious and their purpose clear. The consequent effect on the political and security situation would be most damaging, notwithstanding the statements made by Mr Lynch about his willingness to use similar powers in the south if necessary. 
4. In December 1970 in a period of comparative calm the Northern 
Ireland Government suddenly asked through the United Kingdom Government representative whether emergency contingency plans could be put in hand to make HMS MAIDSTONE, anchored in Belfast Lough, available as a place of detention for internees. HMS MAIDSTONE is a former submarine depot ship at present used to provide accommodation for troops. Both the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary found this proposition unattractive. The idea was somewhat too sensational and would immediately invite comparison with the hulks and would no doubt prove more photogenic than a prison or a barbed wire camp. 
5. As the Cabinet has recently noted, a decision to inter would need the most careful consideration. It is the view of the GOC and of the Chief Constable that even if all known activists were picked up, others at present unknown would immediately step into their place and recruitment to the IRA generally would receive further impetus. 
The current assistance being given by the Metropolitan Police to the RUC in the investigation into the death of John Kavanagh at the

9 February 1971 SUMMARY OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY 
RE NORTHERN IRELAND FROM 1 to 8 FEBRUARY 1971 
1. The past week has been interesting if only to observe the 
curiously unreal activities of the various Irish extremist groups in London. With the ever worsening situation in Northern Ireland it would have seemed logical for them to react spontaneously in sympathy. They did not however, but steadfastly continued with their demonstrations, meetings, etc against the trial of Bowes EGAN and Frank ROCHE which had been planned for some weeks. Their activities listed below were all jointly organised by the Irish Solidarity Campaign, NICRA and Clann na h’Eireann:- 
a. On Friday 5 February they held a public meeting at Conway Hall, WC1. This was attended by some 50 persons and addressed by Eamonn McCANN, Gery LAWLESS, Padraig YEATES (Birmingham) and Bowes EGAN himself. Halfway through his speech, EGAN who appear recently to be finding solace in the bottom of a glass, became unwell and left the meeting. He was later heard to criticise the "ramblings" of LAWLESS and to express his disgust at the meeting.

9th February 1971 You had a word with me on the bench yesterday about 
an answer I gave to a question about arrangements for informing the relatives when soldiers are killed or wounded. I thought you might wish to have the position confirmed. 
Next of kin are notified when a soldier is killed 
or is seriously ill in hospital and in other cases when there is considered to be public interest. In the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland at this time, the latter category is being very liberally interpreted and all cases of wounding are notified to the appropriate next of kin, unless this is considered unwise in any particular case.

REPORT ON NORTHERN IRELAND 
PERIOD FROM 6 p.m. 5th FEBRUARY UNTIL 9 a.m. 8th FEBRUARY 
GENERAL 1. 
It was a violent week-end in Belfast and Londonderry. 
There were also serious incidents at Dungannon where on Saturday night two UDR members were attacked and their arms and ammunition taken; and in the Newry area near the border where early on Monday morning there were a number of explosions, involving the blowing up of two customs posts and damage to three electrical installations. During the week-end a further battalion (3 Light Infantry) was sent to Northern Ireland. 
BELFAST 2. 
During the early evening of Friday there was some minor 
hooligan activity in the Roman Catholic Ardoyne, Clonard, Falls and Ballymurphy areas. At around midnight there were severe eruptions in the Ardoyne and New Lodge areas. On a number of occasions soldiers came under fire, sometimes automatic, and under attack from petrol and nail bombs. Fire was returned and two assailants are known to have been killed. One soldier was killed and seven wounded during the night. During the daylight hours of Saturday all was quiet but trouble started again in the evening in a number of Roman Catholic areas. It was less violent than on the night before, but in the Ardoyne a total of about 50 rounds were fired at the troops, without, however, any casualties being suffered. Again, Sunday during the daylight hours was quiet; but just after midnight there was firing at troops in the Clonard area, resulting in one soldier being injured. 
LONDONDERRY 3. 
Very early on Saturday morning there was trouble with a 
crowd of hooligans in the Bogside. Some fires were started and a barricade erected. The crowd was dispersed by the use of baton rounds. Similar incidents occurred on the following two nights.

6 February 1971 
Minister’s invitation to Major and Mrs. ChichesterClark to come to Chequers on the weekend of 13 and 14 February. 
We spoke yesterday evening about the Prime 
this invitation to Major and Mrs. Chichester-Clark, I was under the clear impression that he had discussed and agreed with the Home Secretary his proposal to invite them. 
When the Prime Minister instructed me to convey 
since you rang and he was, and is, under the same impression. 
I have had a word with the Prime Minister It seems from what you say, that though 
there may have been some discussion of the matter, the Home Secretary does not think that it had been agreed with him. 
I do not know where the misunderstanding 
occurred; and I can only say that both the Prime Minister and I (for what that is worth) are extremely sorry about it. 
In 
going ahead with the invitation if there had been any doubt in our minds about the Home Secretary’s agreement. 
There would have been no question of 
Things and actions are what they are, and the consequences of them will be what they will be. 
other words, the invitation has been issued and accepted, and I do not think that we can revoke it now. 
Major and Mrs. Chichester-Clark are planning to 
arrive at Chequers at about 4.00 p.m. on 13 February, and to leave in the late afternoon or early evening of 14 February. 
The Prime Minister very much hopes

4th February, 1 971 The wording of the Special Assessment of the situation in Northern 
Ireland about which you wrote to me on 25th January may have been a little misleading in its use in paragraph 5 of the word "evidence" that the Ballymurphy disturbances were instigated by the I.R.A. 
It is true that 
evidence is available to show the involvement of the organisation, but it does not point the finger at individual members of the organisation and it would have been more accurate to have said that "intelligence" was available of the I.R.A. involvement. 
Nothing would please the security forces in Northern Ireland more than 
the opportunity to arrest and bring to trial individuals involved in this way, but a conspiracy of silence inhibits their efforts to obtain evidence against individuals and witnesses are unwilling to appear in court for fear of reprisals.

Trouble started with the search of 9 houses in the 
Roman Catholic Clonard area during the morning of 3rd February. There was a reaction from the local residents, and a crowd of about 100, mainly women, formed, and stones were thrown. During the afternoon small gangs of hooligans continued to cause trouble and in the early evening a crowd of about 100 - 150 formed and became aggressive. By 9 o’clock in the evening petrol and nail bombs were being thrown. 
What are believed to have been mainly diversionary 
disturbances then started in Ballymurphy, in the Falls and in Malone Road near Queens University; and, later in the night, in the Ardoyne and in the New Lodge Road. Machinegun fire was reported from three of these areas and in the New Lodge Road it caused 4 injuries to soldiers of a patrol, one of which is likely to be fatal. 
Altogether, 7 casualties were suffered by the Army. 
54 arrests were made and 31 were retained in custody. The Army relied mainly on the baton round and water cannon in dealing with the rioters although fire was returned on about six occasions. No CS was used.
