battalion, Queens Regiment will move from BAOR to Northern Ireland at 1800 tomorrow, 28 July. 
SACEUR has been informed of this development, and the United Kingdom Military Representative notified the Chairman and members of the Military Committee at their meeting this afternoon. 
I have been asked to explain that though pressure of events has made these MOVes inevitable, the units will return to BAOR as soon as possible; but I must add that it cannot be forecast at this stage how long the commitment will last. 
I am copying this letter to our colleagues on the Defence Planning Committee. Edward Peck Permanent Representatives

PUS NORTHERN IRELAND - FORCE LEVELS 
Reference: A. CGS/828 dated 5 June 1972. B. CGS/828 dated 12 June 1972. 
As you know, GOC Northern Ireland believes that the recent cofrontation with the DA has led to a major change in the 
1 . 
security situation. Up until Monday 3 July he had hoped that he could cope with the marches on the 12th by re-deployment into Belfast. But this is no longer so. 
2. The GOC’s recommendation, which both SSNI and I endorse, is 
that the following measures should be taken to provide an adequate force level to cover the period of the 12th July marches: 
a. b. 1st Battalion The Royal Scots, who were despatched 
on 17 June and who were scheduled to return on 13 July, should remain in the Province until 16 July. 
45 Commando Royal Marines (at Arbreath), who had in any case been earmarked to cover the period 4 
- c. The complete Spearhead unit - to Ulster, until at least 13 July. 3. 
should now move so as to be in Northern Ireland on the morning of 10 July and return on 17 July. 
Regiment of Fusiliers (at Catterick) - 13 July, 
to 24 hours’ notice from 0900 hours 10 July. The battalion should remain at this notice, if not despatched 
2nd Battalion Royal should be brought 
and without disrupting summer leave plans. 4. 
All these measures can be implemented without military penalty 
I should be grateful for your approval of this request so that the necessary instructions can be issued.

Northern Ireland: Contingency Planning A short time ago Ministers commissioned a contingency study of the 
"worst case". This is attached; and I am sending copies of it, together with copies of this covering minute, to those Ministers whose Departments have been involved - the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State for Defence and the Home Secretary. 
I am also sending a copy to the Attorney General. The essential features of this report are as follows:(a) 
Legislation would be required (on the lines indicated in Appendix C) in order both to confer on the Government the necessary additional powers and, subsequently, to indemnify all concerned. 
(b) In order to be fully effective the policy would require an additional 27 major units plus supporting elements. 
(c) The reinstatement of internment and interrogation would be inevitable (on the basis of a potential "bag" of about 1600 additional internees in the first two weeks); and it would also be necessary to arrest on suspicion alone. 
(d) A great deal would depend on the extent to which we could continue to count on local co-operation as regards the maintenance of essential services and on the loyalty of the RUC. Otherwise, the result might be complete anarchy. 
(e) The impact on the Republic and on international opinion generally is unpredictable but would be bound to be adverse; and, in certain circumstances, a renewed threat to sterling might emerge. 
(f) For all these reasons we could not sustain this policy indefinitely or, perhaps, for very long. 
we should launch some new political initiative - possibly on an all-Ireland basis 
It would therefore be essential that - very soon after we had taken the drastic measures 
envisaged. Otherwise, or if the political initiative failed, the last state might be worse than the first. 
I have discussed the report with the Permanent Secretaries concerned 
and the CGS. It is explicitly addressed to a situation in which we are on the point of losing control of events unless we take very severe action indeed. Such a situation means that the IRA have intensified their campaign still

1. We were directed to examine a specific course of action that 
Ministers might wish to consider if the security situation in Northern Ireland had deteriorated so far that the Government were on the point of losing control of events. 
2. We have taken as a basic assumption that the Government’s aim remains 
the restoration of a stable society in Northern Ireland, which will remain part of the United Kingdom unless and until the majority of its inhabitants wish otherwise. 
We have not examined the option of a direct 
military assault upon the extremist-dominated Roman Catholic areas of the Province with the aim of securing a total military victory over the Irish Republican Army (IRA), on the ground that it would so completely alienate the.Roman Catholic community from the British Government as to destroy for many years any remaining prospect of re-establishing a stable society within the United Kingdom. 
Nor do we believe that Ministers 
would be willing to consider a complete withdrawal of military forces. 3. 
The course we have been asked to consider is one of strong but 
impartial action, aimed at the removal of arms and explosives by means of a massive reinforcement of troops, and accompanied by searches, interrogation, and probably internment. 
against extremists of both communities to restore law and order, to put an end to intersectarian violence, and to administer a shock in the hope of forcing both factions to realise the necessity of an agreed political solution. We have borne in mind the need to define a clear political objective, and to link military operations with a political initiative directed towards that objective. 
If the course of action contemplated did not achieve this result, the imposition of a political settlement It would be directed as necessary

Planning to meet this concept will be based on the 
following criteria:a. 
i. ii. Force Levels. Reinforcement above the 
current force level of 20 battalions will take place in two phases:- 
Phase 1. Phase 2. To 40 battalions - for 
saturation of all the main areas of conflict. 
To 47 battalions - for 
consolidation in country areas. 
Of the extra 27 units, it is expected that 18 can be provided from Britain and the remaining 9 will be temporarily redeployed from BAOR. 
(The total number of units 
from BAOR then serving in Northern Ireland will be 15, which is roughly the equivalent of one of the three divisions’ teeth arm units. 
This would leave only 2 infantry b. 
battalions in BAOR) Sequence of Action. 
The day on which HMG 
declares a State of Emergency will be Proclamation Day (P Day); that on which it is decided to implement the reinforcement plan will be Reinforcement Day (R Day).

Civil Administration 1. 
Although some addition might be required to the Northern Ireland 
Office staff in Northern Ireland, the civil administration would not in general require immediate reinforcement. 
As the operation proceeded, 
however, considerable pressure would fall on the housing authorities (for repair work and the housing of refugees) and social security authorities (who would face new cases of need, plus interruptions in their normal work. Northern Ireland.

assistance (building and repair materials, and cash) in their task of patching up the community.

LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY FOR ACTION TAKEN BY ARMED FORCES DURING EMERGENCY PERIOD

any view require legislation; others could be provided by Order in Council or by regulations made by the Secretary of State under the existing special powers legislation. 
2. The following additional powers would on any view require legislation:- 
(i) It would be essential to make provision for the transfer of convicted prisoners (though not internees) from custody in Northern Ireland to custody anywhere in Great Britain without the necessity for their consent. 
(ii) A provision (not yet fully worked out) would be desirable to authorise the setting up of special or additional civilian criminal courts or to modify the procedure for the trial of offences in order to prevent undue delay in the administration of justice during the emergency period. 
(iii) It is thought that provision should be made to authorise the imposition (if that should prove necessary) of military control of movement over the land border by those not "belonging" to the United Kingdom.

11. From the outset the danger would have to be faced that all 
possible political initiatives at the proposed conference, particularly if they were being thrust upon a disintegrating or immobile assembly, would run into the sands. 
This is in a sense only to restate the original premise - mamely that the broad plan of action envisaged 
in the report would only be adopted if the policy of political reconciliation and selective military response were no longer tenable.

to move the dissident Republican population out of retaining only the Unionist population. 
2. Though Republicanism is often equated with 
Roman Catholicism, the two terms by no means cover the same ground. Many Catholics prefer the union with Great Britain; and many more feel only an emotional attraction to the Republican ideal. No accurate and recent polls are available; a 1968 poll suggested that only one Catholic in three favoured a united Ireland, and a recent small sample poll pointed to similar conclusions. Nevertheless in the absence of any better guide to political sympathies the following paragraphs assume that the Catholic minority are to be removed from Northern Ireland. 
3. This transfer of population could be achieved by: 
(a) Transferring to the Republic of Ireland (or conceivabl to some separate status within the United Kingdom) areas which contain a Catholic majority; 
(b) Moving individual Catholics from their homes in to new homes in the 
(c) some combination of (a) and (b).

NOTE by Sir William Nield The purpose of the proposed Order is as follows. First, 
to isolate terrorists of both sides or no side from the rest of aall the communities in the civil population; and to do so by designating them by name or by type of offence committed in a new Order. Second, to overcome for the purposes of a temporary emergency period the legal handicaps which the full processes of the law have been proved to impose upon the security forces and those who will assist them, and which have been used by terrorists and terrorist organisations to sue the security forces and persons assisting them on a technicality for unlawful arrest. The Order thus has political, legal and security consequences designed to enable terrorists and terrorist organisations to be dealt with by processes falling so far as possible within those of the normal law, but with the handicaps of that law removed. It is considered imperative for the success of such an Order in isolating terrorists, that it should be accompanied by a continuation and indeed intensification of the political initiatives towards reconciliation of the Northern Irish communities which the Government is already pursuing; and that the military means adopted to search out terrorists and their equipment should be as selective as possible, and should constantly be justified by public explanation of their selective nature as between the terrorists on the one hand and the rest of the population on the other. For that reason the Order is drafted in terms which would allow it to be used (for a short period of notice) against terrorist organisations of either side. 
It would 
also be important that there should if possible be agreement with the Republic of Ireland for close security co-operation in acting against terrorists based in or likely to seek refuge in the territory of the Republic.

Crown committed in pursuit of political or religious aim, including assaults, 
threats, wearing of uniforms, unlawful assembly, possessio

M.I.P.T. TAOISEACH ON NORTHERN BOMBINGS. 
1. ON THE FACE OF IT, THE TAOISEACH’S STATEMENT CONTAINS NO ELEMENTS WHICH WERE NOT BROUGHT OUT IN LAST WEEKS DAILY DEBATE ON THE ADJOURNMENT(MY TEL NOS 490 AND 496). HOWEVER, HE HAS CONCERTINAED THE TIME SCALE AND BROUGHT THE SEARCH FOR A ’’ PERMANENT ACCOMMODATION IN. THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE’’ - I.E. AN AGREED SETTELMENT WHICH WOULD LEAD TO ULTMATE UNIFICATION 
- INTO THE AMBIT 
OF LONDON-DUBLIN-BELFAST CONSULTATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. HE AVOIDS THE TERM ’QUADRIPARTITE TALKS’’, BUT LEAVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE WHAT HE HAS IN MIND. MOREOVER, 
HIS WORDS COULD BE 
INTERPRETED TO EAN THAT HE BELIEVES THAT ONLY THE PROMISE OF EARLY TALKS CAN STOP IRA BOMBING. THiS IS A GOOD REPUBLICAN SENTIMENT, AND MAY HAVE BEEN CALCULATED TO APPEAL IN THE CURRENT CORK BY ELECTION CAMPAIGN: BUT THE TAOISEACH’S REMARKS IN CORK (PARA 3 OF MIPT) SUGGEST THAT HE HAS NO INTENTION OF PRESSING FOR IMMEDIATE ’’QUADRIPARTITE TALKS’’ WITH HMG. 
2. THE TAOISEACH’S MOTIVE IN MAKING THE STATEMENT IN THESE TERMS WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY TO REASSERT HIS GOVERNMENT’S CLAIM TO BE THE MAIN SPOKESMAN ON BEHALF OF THE ’CATHOLIC 
IN FACE OF THE IRA’S EFFORTS TO ASSUME THAT ROLE. DR HILLERY’S IMMEDIATE AND WELL PUBLICISED TRIP TO REPORT TO THE TAOISEACH IN CORK WAS PROBABLY DESIGNED TO BOLSTER THIS CLAIM. 
3. IN ANY EVENT, THE STATEMENT IS EXTREMELY UNHELPFULL IN THE 
NORTHERN CONTEXT, AND AS ONE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR HAS OBSERVED, IN MAKING POLITICAL CAPITAL OUT OF DISASTER, IN DOUBTFUL TASTE.

TELECOM BLATHERWICK/RESIDENT CLERK: BOMBINGS IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
1. FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF STATEMENT ISSUED ON BEHALF OF THE TAOISEACH LAST NIGHT, 21 JULY. " 
THE WHOLE NATION WILL BE HEART-STRICKEN BY THE SAVAGERY 
WHICH HAS TAKEN SO MANY INNOCENT LIVES AND INJURED SCORES OF PEOPLE THIS AFTERNOON. THE RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OF THE VICTIMS AS WELL AS THE INJURED, HAVE THE SYMPATHY OF THE ENTIRE NATION. BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO MOURN OUR LOSS. WE MUST SO ACT AS 
TO ENSURE A PERMANENT END TO THESE VILE EVENTS. LAST FRIDAY I SAID THAT TIME WAS NOT ON THE SIDE OF PEACE. 
SINCE THEN AS MANY AS 30 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE NORTH. SO FAR THIS MONTH ABOUT 70 DEATHS BY VIOLENCE HAVE ALREADY BEEN RECORDED. I REPEAT, THEREFORE, WITH THE GREATEST SENSE OF URGENCY THE CALL I MADE LAST FRIDAY FOR THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN THE NORTH, IN LONDON AND HERE TO CONSULT TOGETHER TO FIND A MEANS OF ELIMINATING VIOLENCE, OF CREATING A REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE NORTH FROM WHICH NO OPTIONS ARE EXCLUDED AND OF MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF A PERMANENT ACCOMMODATION IN THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. THE 2 GOVERNMENTS INVOLVED AND THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP OF THE 2 COMMUNITIES IN THE NORTH HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS. WE MUST NOW SHOW THE WILL TO BEGIN TO RESOLVE THE ANGUISH OF.ALL THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT.’’ 
2. ACCORDING TO TODAY’S IRISH TIMES, THE TAOISEACH SAID IN CORK LAST NIGHT THAT HIS SUGGESTION THAT QUADRIPARTITE TALKS BE HELD WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE ATTITUDE WHICH HE HAD OUTLINED TO THE PRIME MINISTER AT CHEQUERS LAST YEAR: NO APPROACH FOR SUCH CONSULTATION HAD BEEN MADE AND NONE WAS ABOUT TO BE MADE.

GENERAL The current situation is relatively static. Provisional IRA 
violence continues at a slightly lower level than immediately after the ending of the cease-fire, and the UDA has made no significant move. The Provisional IRA have probably suffered significant casualties. It is uncertain what their future policies, and their ability to carry them out will be. Their talks with S. of S. for Northern Ireland and Mr Wilson revealed the Provisional IRA’s insensitivity to the political constraints in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland. INFORMATION POLICY 2.

A much more balanced, and better tempered meeting than last week. 
Deedes + 110 (including most Ulster Unionists). Deedes began by speaking about his visit. Belfast looks like a city at war. The 
troops must be allowed to hit back when attacked. There is no reason to believe that they are not able to attack points from which they come under fire. Fowler. No help to attack W.W. It may be necessary to take stronger military 
action. W.W. (the conciliator) is the best man to take it. (Cheers). Tilney. We cannot govern Ulster indefinitely. Must deal with I.R.A. in the end. 
Wants plebiscite now, controlled by either European or white Commonwealth arbitrators. Would welcome opportunity to cut Gardian knot. F. Bennett. We must change policy 
- no disloyalty intended. Must not equate 
I.R.A. with U.D.A. Pity to learn from I.R.A. the news that W.W. had met them. Luce. Supports direct rule. Could not expect solution in 4 months. Need for 
tougher military action to go hand in hand with political efforts. Stressed need to maintain friendly relations with Dublin. E. King. Ulster is not really part of U.K. We cannot govern it from Westminster. 
Ulster people must have political expression, and we must restore a political institution there. Englishmen have never settled Irish disputes. Strengthen U.D.R. and a local regular force. J. Page. Cannot go on as we are. Cut off services and social security benefits 
i.e. in N.G.A.s. Walters. Send message of support to W.W. Boscawen. Too soon to say if initiative has failed. I.R.A. is susceptible to a 
tough approach. Take a tougher military line, without going into N.G.A.s. Fidler. Hope Conservatives will not argue in public on Ulster. We do not want 
outside help. Continue as before, with a tougher military approach. Biggs-Davison. Dublin is being tough on I.R.A. (?), and we are being weak. We 
must support Lynch and clamp down militarily, and economically. Adley. Supports W.W. Orr. His forebodings are proved correct. Direct rule has created a vaccuum. No- 
one in Ulster can see his way ahead. There are 2 sides - the law abiding majority (of both religions) - v - the terrorists. Surely U.K. does not have to ponder over which side to take. Restoration of law must precede conciliation. An agreed solution in Ulster is impossible. It must be imposed. The Times letter is not a personal attack on W.W. If he takes a different line, then confidence in him could be restored.

On Thursday, 20 July, the Prime minister discussed 
a number of issues relating to future policy in Northern Ireland with the Secretary of State for Defence, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and the Chief of the General Staff. There was general agreement among those present that 
we should maintain for the time being our policy of responding to IRA attacks, but not mounting an all-out military offensive. 
not offer any obvious solution to the problem, but an all-out offensive against the IRA would at present seriously alienate Catholic opinion. 
It was true that this policy did If, however, the 
IRA themselves adopted a more aggressive approach, the Security Forces would be able to respond. In discussion the following main points were made:(i) When the Leader of the Opposition had met IRA 
leaders earlier in the week they had taken a very hard line. 
Mr. Wilson had reported that he had not offered 
any prospect of a change in Labour Party policy to meet the IRA point of view; and he agreed that there should be no further contacts with the IRA for the time being. Mr. Wilson was, however, in favour of developing high level contacts with the UDA. 
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland already had this possibility in mind.

GEN 79(72) 27th Meeting - 21 July 1972 
You may wish to discuss:first, the plebiscite. second, guidelines for military operations in the next few weeks (as we approach 12th August), within the present policy of reconciliation tempered with firm yet selective response to provocation. The Chiefofthe General Staff will be "on call" for this part of the discussion. 
2. On the plebiscite, the main points raised in Cabinet this morning were:(a) Is it established beyond doubt that legislation is necessary? 
(b) When should the Bill be introduced, and by what date must it have the Royal Assent? 
(c) 
3. 4. 
Is it necessary for the form of the Question to be included in the Bill? 
As regards (a) Parliamentary Counsel will be available to advise. As regards (b),if the plebiscite is to be held before the local 
government elections, a Bill must probably receive the Royal Assent by the end of September at the very latest. The Secretary of State envisages putting it to the Legislation Committee next week and introducing it in the House in the following week, i. e. the week beginning 31st July, 10 days before the date at present planned for the Summer Adjournment. It should pass the Commons before the Recess. 
It could be taken by the 
Lords in September, but only if Ministers are prepared to recall the Commons, formally for Royal Assent or substantively for any Lords’ Amendments. 5. 
As regards (c) the main points outstanding from the previous 
discussion (GEN 79(72) 24th Meeting, Item 3) were:(i) 
What form should the Question take? (ii) 
Can the Question be made meaningful without some prior indication of the constitutional arrangements which those who opt for maintenance of the union may expect to have to live with?

20th JULY 1972 With permission, Mr. Speaker, I will make a 
statement. The House will wish to be aware of developments in the situation in Northern Ireland since my statement last Friday. 
The rate of shooting incidents involving the 
security forces has fallen from the very high figure on Friday 14 July, but I must tell the House that they remain at the level of from 50-70 a day. The majority have occurred in Belfast. The IRA have again used a rocket launcher, but fortunately caused no casualties and litt damage. Six soldiers and a constable of the RUC have been killed. One of the soldiers lost his life while attempting to defuse a bomb. Nineteen soldiers and two constables of the RUC have been wounded. A civilian was shot dead when he tried to apprehend two terrorists planting a bomb; and I know the House has learned with particular sorrow that a baby boy was killed by an explosion in Strabane yesterday. I am sure the House will wish to express their sympathy with the families concerned. 
Several explosions have caused damage to the centre of Londonderry during this period; and a large explosion

18th July 1972 Thank you so much for your letter, and I 
assure you that I am well aware of your difficulties. Of course I will continue to do what I can but it will not be easy. 
I see the strategy this way:First destroy the gunmen, there can be no 
reconciliation of the communities while they dominate one side. 
Nor will they be persuaded from their ideals. with troops. 
Tactically I would saturate the No Go areas Not just a Battalion at a time, but a 
Brigade, standing room only. I am certain that 
there would be infinitely fewer casualties if it were done this way and soon it must be done. 
I recently 
put this idea to two serving Generals, both of whom wholeheartedly agreed. 
If it is not, the U.D.A. will exert increasing 
pressure and that will put our troops into an impossible position of having a war on two fronts. 
anyhow so reduced in quantity and therefore power, intimidation will be greatly lessened.

Ulster. you do. 
Thank you for your letter of 13 July about I entirely understand why you write as But when we embarked on our present course 
last arch we knew that the going would be difficult. We need to ask ourselves whether there is any real alternative to the present policy of seeking to reconcile the communities in Northern Ireland. However, this policy does not prevent the security forces from acting with complete firmness against terrorism and lawlessness whenever it appears, as is shown by the action the Army have taken in Belfast in recent days. You refer in your letter to the meeting Willie 
Whitelaw had with some leaders of the Provisional I.R.A. 
He took the view, I believe quite rightly, that in these very difficult circumstances any action

difficulties I hope it will be borne in mind that any retreat from this position will give the majority, with the exception of the Vanguard, in Northern Ireland serious and possibly dangerous misgivings.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 140700 TO 170700 HRS JULY GENERAL 1. 
The pattern of violence continued at a high level, but shooting incidents/bombings decreased in number from 245/11 on Fri/Sat, through 114/7 on Sat/Sun to 61/3 on Sun/Mon. 
nevertheless casualties were 
heavy and included five soldiers (making 13 in all in the 7 days since the ceasefire ended, the worst week yet), one RUC and one civilian killed. Terrorist casualties included one definately killed and 54 hits claimed by Security Forces. In Belfast, the main areas- of activity were in Ballymurphy and the Ardoyne where shooting was frequent; and in Lenadoon, where the evacuation of some 2000 (NOT 3000) people, if not a propaganda exercise, makes one wonder what measure of moderate opinion still remains in such areas. In Londonderry, a confused situation about barrier building put the Army in a poor light through no apparent fault of its own; and the Provisional leader there has been reported as saying that the bombing programme for the city centre was practically complete but would be continued in other ways, mainly against Army targets. In the Rural Are s, a youth of 18 died on Saturday in Strabane after incidents during which soldiers being stoned replied by firing rubber bullets. But the worst incidents were those at Crossmaglen involving the death of an ATO on Saturday and the mining of a 1DWR pig on Sunday when two soldiers were killed. In the Republic, Mr Lynch’s government had a majority of 4 in the 2 days debate 
on Ulster but faces a critical bye 
election in mid Cork in early August. In Great Britain, weekend press headlines were all dominated by Ulster and concentrated variously on the end of the ceasefire; the refugees; the abandonment of the plans to protect the Londonderry City centre; Lenadoon; and the possible involvement of freed internees in the renewed campaign of violence. Few if any of the papers linked the refugee problem with the annual holidays. The leader writers recognised the gravity of the situation but while acknowledging the dangers of any alteration of the current policy of conciliation in the long term, accepted for the most part that force must be met with equal force and that in the short term the power of the terrorists must be reduced by positive action. 
2. During FRI/SAT 14/15 JUL 72. There were 245 shooting incidents with 
the Security Forces involved in 194. Two soldiers were killed in Belfast, one of them when a pig was pierced. Nine other soldiers were wounded two of them are VSI. 39 hits were claimed and one body of a terrorist was recovered. There were two major explosions in Belfast and three in Londonderry. In the Border/Rural areas there were six explosions and five devices were neutralized. 
3. During SAT/SUN 15/16 JUL 72. There were 114 shooting incidents with 
the Security Forcem involved in 76. Capt YOUNG RAOC, ATO, was killed whilst attempting to dismantle a bomb near Forkill in Co Armagh. One RUC constable was killed and two others were wounded in Belfast. There were no other Security Force casualties and nine hits were claimed. There were no explosions in Belfast,one in Londonderry and six in border/rural areas. In Londonderry a plan to build a road block in William S. and one in Waterloo Place to make it more difficult for bombs to be brought from the Bogside/Cregan was abandoned as a result of a political decision. In Belfast a number of women and children left for the Republic but it is expected that most will return after the holidays. There were demonstrations

13th July 1972 I am more depressed now about the situation in 
Ulster than I have been since the troubles started. Speaking for myself and my friends we all 
agreed that Willie was right to try a soft line, though none of usknowing the formwas optimistic as to the outcome. 
long was this soft period to last? 
The principal question was, how It cannot go on 
for ever especially as it produces no results. The situation now is that Willie has lost all 
credibility in Ulster since he said publicly that he would have no dealings with the I.R.A., then did and look at the result ! This puts the like of us who have backed him to the best of our ability, vouched for him to those who enquired, in an intolerable position. 
We too have lost credibility amongst 
those who trusted us, and though I have to say so, it is the likes of us who have kept the protestant 
temperature down because the saner ones did trust us and believe in us. 
I go back to Ely for my monthly visit in ten 
days time and frankly I am dreading it, because I shall have to face my friends. 
It is no earthly use in trying to make a deal

Thank you for your letter of 11 July. There was - 
indeed there could be - no 
question of accepting the demands made by the I.R.A. leaders. 
Willie Whitelaw made that 
absolutely clear in the House yesterday, when he said: 
"They made demands which I could not accept. 
His offer to "consider" the demands was made only because he had already made it clear that he was not there to negotiate or as a plenipotentiary, but had as a menber of a Cabinet to report to his colleagues. 
I really cannot see anything in his 
statement which implies that the British Government might consider these demands as the basis for an agreement. 
At any rate I can assure you that they will not do so.

otherwise, the proceedings must be treated as being highly classified. SECURITY POLICY 2. 
At the request of the Ministry of Defence there was some discussion of 
the consideration which Ministers have asked should be given to the ways in which the security forces might adopt a higher profile. It was agreed that 
it would be necessary to specify precisely what action by the security forces could

The Rt Hon Sir Burke Trend GCB CVO Cabinet Office 70 Whitehall London S W 1 
This letter is a postscript to this afternoon’s GEN 79 meeting, and is sent because my Secretary of State is worried on one important point. 
This is that there 
is in the present situation in Northern Ireland a serious risk in under-reacting as well as in overreacting. 
are as follows. 
The IRA consists of a few hundreds of effective members which, with a good deal of money, a fairly secure base in Eire and sympathy of the Catholic population, have enabled them to terrorise Northern Ireland for over 
2½ years. 
In that time the Protestant population’s traditional hostility to the Catholic population and to Eire has been very strongly intensified. 
These groups are now well At working and middle 
class level this has led to the formation first of local vigalante groups, and then to their confederation first in the UVF and then in the UDA (now 25,000 strong and supplied with arms). 
disciplined, centrally co-ordinated, allied with the 100,000 strong Protestant trade union, the Loyalist Association of Workers, and in constant contact with a spectrum of Protestant political organisations from the right of the Unionist Party through the Paisley’s Democratic Unionist Party to Craig’s Vanguard. 
The UDA never believed in the conciliation policy, nor in the cease-fire, and now the cease-fire is over they are demanding action to bring IRA terrorism to an end and to open up and police properly the Catholic "no-go" areas. 
They say they will extend their own "no-go" 
areas until this is done and make no secret of their intention to use this as a means of pressure on the British Government including its Northern Ireland component. 
There is also plenty of evidence to suggest that they also intend to use their undoubted The facts and the logic behind this concern

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 070700 to 100700 HRS JUL 72 GENERAL 
1. The weekend started quietly enough, but ended in serious disturbances following a resumption of violence by the Provisional IRA on Sunday evening. Talks about rehousing displaced Catholics in empty houses in HORN DRIVE on a Protestant part of the SUFFOLK housing estate in ANDERSONSTOWN had been going on all weekend, but Seamus TWOMEY, the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade Commander refused to accept the policy agreed at a meeting of the interested parties chaired by Mr CAIRNCROSS of the NIO on Sunday morning at MUSGRAVE. A confrontation between the Security Forces and Catholic youths followed in the afternoon when a lorry carrying bedding and furniture belonging to the displaced families came down LENADON Avenue and was rammed by a Saracen as it tried to break a temporary Security Force barrier. Rioting immediately broke out, followed shortly after 6 pm by sniping at Security Forces. Thereafter the situation deteriorated rapidly, and spread to other areas of BELFAST. Five soldiers received GSW and 10 more were injured in the LENADOON rioting. Three Pigs were penetrated by rifle fire. (HQ Northern Ireland urgently want 6 x SARACEN ambulances from GB, plus up to a further 90? Saracens for other purposes.) 
The official end to their ceasefire 
was announced by the Provisional IR in DUBLIN at 2130hrs. Shortly before midnight trouble broke out in Londonderry, when 5 bombs exploded in 3 minutes, followed by shooting until 0230hrs. Further details are in para 4 below. In the Republic, there was rioting at an IRA demonstration outside the CURRAGH Camp. In GB weekend press comment on Ulstr was varried but off the headlines. TV coverage on Sunday evening was full. SSNI has called for a paper on ’Military Operations in the Event of Renewed IRA Violence’ to be discussed at 1100hrs on Monday.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and 
Mr. Woodfield reported this afternoon on their talk with the Provisional leaders this afternoon. The Provisionals were represented by: Mr. MacStiofain Mr. O’Connell Mr. MacGuinness Mr. Adams Mr. Tuomey Mr. Bell (or Barl) 
The six men were accompanied by a Dublin lawyer who was not the same lawyer as at the earlier meeting. Mr. MacStiofain was very much in charge. They started by reading out from a piece of paper 
a statement which said that the leadership of the IRA welcomed the discussions with the Secretary of State, which they hoped would lead to a settlement of the problems of Ireland. It was now necessary to devise machinery by which the will of the people of Ireland could be given effect. The IRA took the view that this could best be achieved by following their peace plan. The peace plan contains three main elements: (i) the British Government should recognise publicly that it is the right of the whole of the people of Ireland acting as a unit to decide the future of Ireland; 
(ii) the British Government should undertake to withdraw the British Army from Ireland by 1975; 
(iii) the expected conditions on internment and amnesties.

July 1972 Reference: A. A/BR/30/1/M04 dated 5 July 1972. 
1. Headquarters Northern Ireland weekly operational summary for the week ending 5 July 1972 was circulated under Reference A. An updating of the summary up to 0800 hours Friday 7 July 1972 is attached at Annex A. 
2. The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. 3. The weekly intelligence report as at 7 July 1972 has been issued separately. Outlook 
4. The future is likely to be determined primarily by Protestant reactions to the ’NO GO’ areas and to the marching season which is upon us. Increasing lawlessness and a continuation of selective assassination could raise sectarian tensions to the point where violence could erupt with no warning. The holiday period is about to begin, with the closure of a number of large concerns, will increase the number of people on the streets. 
5. As in the past years, the IRA are likely to regard their role during the marching season as defensive, in the ordinary meaning of this word. The leadership of both IRA factions is unlikely during the next week to break the ceasefire, but uncoordinated acts by individuals or small units, remains a possibility.

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY DATED 5 JULY 1972 UPDATING POINTS AS AT 0800 HRS FRIDAY 7 JULY 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
ver the last two days there have been 44 shooting incidents of 
which 7 were at Security Forces. Some of these incidents occurred within Protestant areas, others within Catholic IRA dominated enclaves and their explanation remains matter of speculation. Though none should be construed as an infringement of the ceasefire almost all the permutations of option could account for the increase. 2. 
Another prominent feature of the past few days has been the 
increase in intimidation which has caused intersectarian feeling to run high. In order to handle reports from the public alleging intimidation the Ministry of Home Affairs have established a Public Protection Agency similar to that first introduced in 1969. Into premises recently acated by Protestants in the Suffolk estate of Andersonstown, some Catholic families have been moved. This delicate. operation on an interface which has long been a source of conflict, is being watched with some trepidation on all fronts. 3. 
with the Officials calling on the people of ballymurphy to reject the dictatorial policies and activities of the Provisionals. The Prvisionals in their turn continually deride the Officials. 4. 
The Inner Council of the UDA met on the evening of 5 July to 
discuss their future tactics. In Belfast they are to set up another No-Go area this weekend as well as several 48 hr No-Go areas. The partial No-Go area in the Waterside is also to be strengthened. They propose to suspend the creation of additional areas thereafter for one fortnight yet again challenging the Secretary of State to take

Progress has continued to be made in talks with representative groups 
in Londonderry about a restoration of normality but has been hampered by the activities of the Ulster Defence Association in Belfast. Since the confrontation on 3 July the U.D.A. has announced a fortnight’s"truce ". This may reflect a drawing back from the brink, but is probably also influenced by the many marches that will take place in the next few days. All necessary precautions are being taken to deal with the marches, but as usual, it is impossible to predict whether trouble will occur. ARMY PLANNING 2. 
The Ministry of Defence are considering contingency planning for a 
deteriorating security situation. It would be helpful to them to co-ordinate with the Northern Ireland Office on matters of policy which inevitably arise. But it will be difficult to provide any definite assumptions, and necessary to consider whether this sort of liaison is better achieved in London or Belfast. The Ministry of Defence will discuss this further with the Northern Ireland Office after the Director of Military Operations has returned to London next week.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 060700 TO 070700 JULY 1972 General 
1. The day was very quiet for the Security Forces. They were involved in only one of the 18 shooting incidents. There was an explosion in Belfast, the first in the Province for four days. 
Belfast 2. There were 16 shooting incidents. 
a. Andersonstown. 150 UDA men tried to prevent Catholic families moving into houses at the south end of Leenadoon Ave which had previously been occupied by Protestants. The UDA men dispersed after their leader had had discussions with CO 2 Fd Regt. 
b. Ballymurphy. There were five shooting incidents none involving the Security Forces. Samuel Robinson (19, Protestant) was admitted to RVH with gunshot wounds after shots were fired at his car near Springfield Rd RUC Station. 
c. Falls. There were five shooting incidents, none involving the Security Forces. Groups of armed men were seen in the Lower Falls checking cars. 
d. Ardoyne/Shankill. There were four shooting incidents, none involving the Secuirty Forces. During the evening UDA men were seen setting spikes in concrete across Mayo St (in one of the Protestant ’no go areas’). There was an explosion (estimated by ATO to be 100 lbs) in the churchyard of Holy Cross School. Shortly after shots were fired. The church is on a route regularly used by troops. A Catholic man was wounded when shots were fired from a car at a group of people in Ligoniel. 
e. New Lodge. There were two shooting incidents. In one a shot was fired at Crumlin Road Jail. 
Londonderry 
3. There was one shooting incident during the evening on the Waterside when one shot was fired at a Catholic owned house. There were no casualties and the Security Forces were not involved. Border and Rural Areas 4. In the only shooting incident reported, a shot was fired in Antrim during the evening. The Security Forces were not involved. A report of two men having been found with gun shot wounds to the legs in a car near the border South of Newry could not be confirmed since the men had disappeared when an ambulance arrived on the scene. RUC received the report from a local who had seen the two men. Temporary check points were erected and manned by Catholics during the evening in Lurgan and were removed at first light. Two Protestant barriers remain in Portadown. A VCP was established by Catholics at the entrance to the Brybeg Estate in Newry.

Northern Ireland: GEN 79 You may wish to conduct the Meeting under 3 main headings. 
(a) The general political and security situation. (b) The Border Plebiscite. 
(The memorandum GEN 79(72) 14 by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is relevant). 
(c) An Act of Indemnity. (The report by officials GEN 79(72) 13 is relevant). 
The Political and Security Situation 2. 
You will wish to ask the Chief of the General Staff and the 
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for their current assessment of the military and political situation respectively. 
Attention might be 
directed towards the following points:(a) The maintenance by the Provisional IRA of their "ceasefire". (b) Progress in dismantling barricades in the Bogside and Creggan areas of Londonderry. 
(c) The attempts by the UDA to establish "No-go" areas in Belfast and to a lesser extent elsewhere. 
(d) The disappearance from parole of the convicted Protestant murderer "Gusty" Spence. 
(e) The prospects of trouble arising from the major Orange Marches on 12th July. 
(f) The possible need for further reinforcement of the garrison. (g) Assessment of prospects for progress towards the Constitutional Conference.

Plebiscite on the Border (GEN 79(72) 14) 
You may wish to begin with the question of the interval between 
plebiscites. The draft Bill stipulates an interval of not less than 15 years; but the Secretary of State believes that it would be better for each successive plebiscite to be set up by Order in Council with a statutory interval. 
I believe that his change of view stems at least partly from 
the implications ofincluding a reference to the statutory period in the Question to be posed. 2. 
The form of the Question might be the next (and probably the most 
difficult) point for discussion. The Secretary of State has sought to devise a single Question demanding a clear "yes" or "no" answer in a form thatwill leave no doubt as to the wishes of the majority. For this purpose the Question must be posed in terms not only of leaving the United Kingdom but of becoming part of a united Ireland. 
solely in terms of leaving the United Kingdom, it would not be clear whether those who said "Yes" wanted a united Ireland or a completely independent Northern Ireland. 
Similarly, the question leaves for 
separate consideration (presumably in the constitutional conference) such complications as the form of local or provincial government that Northern Ireland should enjoy within the United Kingdom. 
(But is it 
realistic to ask people where they wish to "belong" without telling them how they will be governed according to the answer which they give?) The Secretary of State feels, I believe, that the inclusion of the words "within the next 15 years" might call to mind some of the formulae canvassed before and during the First World War and might reawaken Protestant fears of a sell-out after the completion of the 15 year period. On the other hand it could be argued that the omission of these words would make the question a very difficult one for those who wanted a united Ireland but not yet. 3. A third point is the treatment of Northern Ireland as a simple 
entity. The draft Bill speaks of "enabling the people of Northern Ireland as a whole to make known their wishes"; but it provides that the votes should be counted separately for the County Borough of Belfast and for each county. The Secretary of State rightly points out that it would be virtually impossible to give up territory which opted for a united Ireland

One point outstanding from the Meeting’s previous discussion of 
the Attorney General’s memorandum GEN 79(72) 8 was his recommendation (paragraph 26) that for the present there should not be any statutory indemnity for members of the security forces in either civil or criminal matters. 2. 
presented for discussion. 
A similar view has been reached by officials in the report now Officials point out that the question of 
indemnity only arises when the wide powers conferred under the Special Powers Acts are exceeded; that there are obvious objections to the enactment of a general indemnity before order has been restored and all detainees released; and that any form of indemnity which appreciably abridges existing domestic remedies in respect of the breaches of the Human Rights Convention alleged by the Government of the Republic would undermine our case against the admissibility of the allegations before the Commission at Strasbourg. They consider that, if we find ourselves confronted with a spate of private prosecutions or civil actions giving rise to security problems or other major embarrassments, an Act which went no further than barring private prosecutions and transferring compensation jurisdiction from the courts to administrative tribunals would raise fewer problems in Parliament and at Strasbourg; but that, unless we are so confronted, it would be best to wait until order has been restored before considering whether an act of indemnity would be appropriate. 3. 
You lave yourself made the point that one of the reasons for the 
imposition of direct United Kingdom rule in Northern Ireland has been the need to ensure that the rule of law operates there as in the rest of the United Kingdom. The meeting may therefore be prepared to accept the advice of officials backed by the Attorney General; but Ministers will no doubt wish to ask the Attorney to keep under close review the number of private prosecutions and civil actions lest a situation should arise so exceptional as to call for special measures on the lines indicated by the report.

PROTESTANT ACTIVITY The striking features of the confrontation with the U.D.A. last night 
were the U.D.A.’s apparent willingness to risk engaging the Army with violence, and its disciplined withdrawal afterwards. Also, its stated aim was to protect Protestant areas, not simply to demand the removal of Roman Catholic "no-go" areas. Some reports suggest that the U.D.A. did not plan the confrontation very much in advance. There is not so far any clear indication of how the U.D.A. intends to take part in patrolling. 2. 
The U.D.A. may have gained in confidence as a result of last night’s 
activity. An increase of intimidation by Protestants is reported, and some Roman Catholic families are reported to be leaving their homes. There is no firm information about the recent murders, but it looks as if extremists on both sides are responsible. It is thought that Spence was taken by his Protestant colleagues. The murders carry with them two risks: that the large number of unsolved murders will be highlighted, and that sectarian tension will increase (especially if a popular figure on either side is a victim). 3. 
There are some reports that further industrial action - not necessarily affecting just the "no-go" areas in Londonderry - is being considered by the 
Loyalist Association of Workers. BARRICADES IN LONDONDERRY 4.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 300700 JUNE TO 030700 JUL 72 GENERAL 
1. Sporadic violence has continued over the weekend, and the general mood remains uneasy. The most significant feature was the erection of UDA barriers not only in BELFAST and LONDONDERRY but also in nine other towns. The following barriers were still up at 0700hrs 3 Jul: BELFAST-42-all round the SHANKILL DERRY-3-on the WATERSIDE: LURGAN-2 PORTADOWN-1. There was a major gun battle in the ARDOYNE/BONE area of BELFAST in the early hours of Sunday between both factions and the Army. The majority of the gunmen involved were apparently dissident Provisionals. The main Protestant marches on Saturday all passed without incident. Assassination squads from both factions have been at work and a totalof six men have been murdered in two days, one on Saturday (JOBLING, an English youth), and five on Sunday (2 x RC, 2 x Protestant, 1 x unidentified). Gusty SPENCE, a murderer, has broken his parole in suspicious circumstances. In LONDONDERRY, SF completed the withdrawal from the BRANDYWELL post by late on Saturday in exchange for the removal of three permanent BOGSIDE barricades. Possible withdrawal from BLIGHs LANE awaits further developments. There were no SF casualties over the weekend.

Annex A to A/BR/290/4/M04 Dated 31 July 1972 
SITREP ON OPERATION MOTORMAN AS AT 310700A JUL General 
1. The reinforcement phase (OP GLASSCUTTER) went smoothly and was completed during the early afternoon of Sunday. 
2. The deployment of the 27 units in the infantry role was 14 to BELFAST (11 in 39 Bde and 3 in 24 Bde); 8 to LONDONDERRY (all in 8 Bde); and 5 in the rural areas (4 in 3 Bde and 1 in 8 Bde). 
3. CLF’s directive for the operation was duly amended to meet Ministerial direction, and the amended order was formally cleared by SSNI on 31 July. The amended first page together with Annex A on arrest policy and Annex B on information policy have been issued separately. 
4. Information Policy. The texts of SSNI’s RTE broadcast on Friday evening where it concerns security matters; and the press association reports of his statements at 2130rs on Sunday and 0650hrs on Monday are at 
5. RUC Assistance. SSNI asked the GOC at 0530hrs on Monday for military clerical and administrative assistance at certain police offices. Details will be available in due course from BGS(Int). 
6. The operation itself has so far gone according to plan with little or no resistance. The terrorists have clearly gone to ground rather than stand and fight, unless they were genuinely surprised by the speed of the operation, which is oubtful. In LODONDERRY 6 terrorist gunmen and 1 petrol bomber are claimed hit. There have been no civilian or SF casualties. Permanent patrol bases are now being established for four framework battalions. All barricades are being removed. The UDA is removing its own in the Waterside with Army assistance. It is hoped to be able to withdraw the AVRE armoured bulldozers in time for them to sail in HMS FEARLESS on the noon tide on Monday. (The AVREs were invaluable in clearing the major obstacles). In BELFAST all extremist strongholds have been penetrated and patrol bases are being established. There have been no casualties. Barricades are being removed, IRA ones by SF and UDA ones voluntarily. In the rural areas hard core districts in PORTADOWN, LURGAN, ARMAGH and NE RY have been occupied without oppositio Barricades are being removed. Detailed comments follow below 
.. 
7. As for the immediate future, heavy patrolling and selective searching will continue from firm bases once established. A few arrests will be made today, with more to follow. Some form of IRA propaganda counter blast must be 
expected, probably based as usual on false allegations of SF ’brutality.’ 8. Sitreps. No further special sitreps will be issued unless the situation

EXTRACTS FROM MR WHITELAW’S STATEMENTS 1. Friday 28 July. Interview for RTE (Republic of Ireland) 
Annex A to A/BR/29C/ 4 /M04 Dated 31 July 1972 
a. Question. Mr Whitelaw, could I begin by asking you why you have decided to send another four thousand troops to the North? 
b. Answer. 
I think one has to start from last Friday, described all over the world in many places as ’bloody Friday’. It certainly was. The most inhumane killings of men, women and children. Clearly designed to be so, which shows that the Provisional IRA were determined to pursue violence and, if necessary to wreck the whole community in Northern Ireland in pursuit of their objectives. That was a clear challenge which had to be faced, and it will be faced. 
I want to 
make it perfectly clear that I oust protect the law-abiding community from terrorists and gunmen who are seeking to wreck the whole place. That cannot be, and for that reason I must see that the Security Forces are enabled to go freely throughout the whole community. 
nd they will be. And if that is to be the case, then 
I must make it abundantly clear that if they are to be able to move freely then all barricades from wherever they are put up, whoever put then up, Protestant barricades, Roman Catholic barricades all of them, the whole lot, must come down so that the Security Forces can move freely. I hope people will take them down themselves, if they don’t, I must make it perfectly clear that the Security Forces would have to do so in the interests of stopping killing and maiming of innocent men, women and children. 
c. Question. 
Are you saying, in fact, that the troops will move against the No-Go areas. 
d. Answer. hat I am saying, and making perfectly clear is that the troops 
are there to stop acts of inhumanity. They are there to see that they can dove freely about the community in order to stop the sort of killings and troubles that we had last Friday. That really cannot happen in any community. 
2. Sunday 30 July. Statement from Stormont. "From the time of this announcement there will be substantial 
activity by the Security Forces in various parts of Northern Ireland. Tho object is to enable the Security Forces to move freely 
throughout all areas and so to protect the whole community. Where such activity is taking place people will best assist the 
Security Forces and protect themselves by keeping off the streets."

1. that the Rev Paisley is the most likely future Protestant leader in an area where there seems a marked lack of leadership for the Protestant Community; 
2. that the Provisional IRA believe that a "United Ireland" is only just round the corner; this view being fanned by the news media, especially the Dublin daily papers; 
3. that any moves made by the Secretary of State which give pleasure to, for example, the majority would be more than proportionately disliked by the minority and vice versa and therefore it is very difficult to see any solution 
and 4. that the Provisionals are unlikely to mount any campaign of violence in Londonderry unless the area is attacked by Protestants. 
Dr O’Brien enquired about the Secretary of State’s proposed plebiscite on the border and Mr Whitelaw explained that he is committed to having one in order to reassure the Protestant majority. In Dr O’Brien’s view there will be a great number of Catholic abstentions to the question "do you want Northern Ireland to remain as part of the United Kingdom or become part of a United Ireland?" simply because, although Northern Catholics might eventually want a United Ireland they would not want, here and now, to give up the benefits of being part of the United Kingdom. Dr O’Brien added that if a similar referendum were undertaken in the South a majority of people, having seen on television the actions of both Catholics and Protestants in the North would probably not want to join with them. 
In closing Dr O’Brien said that there was in the Republic a general feeling for peace and he hoped that this would be to the Secretary of States’ benefit.

Northern Ireland In the absence of both the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland 
and the Secretary of State for Defence you may wish to inform the Cabinet that the military operation which they approved at their last meeting has at any rate on all the evidence available this evening executed. 
- been successfully Its success has no doubt been a factor in the maintenance of 
bipartisan support for the Government’s policy, as evidenced in the reception given to Mr. Channon’s statement this afternoon. 2. 
A high level of control has been established in the former "no go" 
areas of Belfast and Londonderry, and in other major trouble spots throughout the Province. Nearly all barricades are down, although a few (both IRA and UDA) are so firmly embedded that their demolition will take a little time. No more than 32 rounds were fired by the Army during the operation. 
Five gunmen were seen to be hit; and two killed and two 
wounded bodies were recovered. The security forces sustained no casualties themselves, and were responsible for no casualties to "civilians". The only incident causing "civilian" casualties was the explosion of a car bomb at Claudy, south east of Londonderry, causing six deaths and some 30 injuries. 3. 
There has been some evidence that the Army’s entry into the 
Roman Catholic enclaves is welcome to at least some of the population. The operation has produced a noticeable improvement in the morale of the Army, and still more of the RUC. An RUC detachment has been established in Bligh’s Lane; and they have asked to take part in joint patrols in Armagh. It is hoped to secure a continued increase in RUC activity. Meanwhile the Army’s first priority is to establish itself in the enclaves, with a view to vigorous patrolling and selective searches designed to widen the intelligence base. 4. 
The IRA appear to have gone to ground, and have perhaps missed 
a trick by not seeking to rally the Catholic population in resistance to the military reoccupation. There is as yet no indication of whether they will counter-attack or whether they may perhaps be demoralised by the total revulsion against "Bloody Friday". The UDA are also quiet, and have accepted the Army’s help in the removal of their barricades.

1. TOWARDS THE END OF MY MEETING WITH THE TAOISEACH RECORDED IN MY TELS 527 AND 528 THE CONVERSATION BECAME, TO SAY THE LEAST, INFORMAL. MR LYNCH WAS EXHAUSTED BY LONG DAYS OF ELECTIONEERING AND SPOKE WITH A FREEDOM WHICH SHOULD NOT BE RECORDED FOR USE AGAINST HIM. THE FOLLOWING POINTS, HOWEVER, ARE MATTERS OF LEGITIMATE PUBLIC INTERESTS. 
(1) I ASKED HIM HOW SERIOUS AN ISSUE REUNIFICATION HAD BEEN IN THE BY-ELECTION AND HOW MUCH IT MATTERED TO THE IRISH PEOPLE AS A WHOLE. HIS ANSWER AMOUNTED TO SAYING THAT THEY COULD NOT CARE LESS. AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED, HE WANTED PEACE AND JUSTICE IN THE NORTH AND CLOSE FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION WITH US. WE ALL HAD TO RECOGNISE THAT THERE WAS A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF INTER-DEPENDENCE BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH, BUT HE THOUGHT WE COULD GO A VERY LONG WAY ALONG THE ROAD TO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE REGARDED AS A UNITED IRELAND UPON THE BASIS OF EXISTING SOVEREIGNTIES. (11) HE IS INTERESTED IN MR WHITELAW’S REMARK (IN THE RTE INTERVIEW) ’’I REALISE, NATURALLY, THE INTEREST THAT MR LYNCH HAS AND I FULLY ACCEPT THIS AND I WOULD LIKE TO FEEL THAT THERE CAN BE COOPERATION BETWEEN US ALL ABOUT THESE VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS. I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE.’’ HE ASKED WHETHER I THOUGHT MR WHITELAW WOULD BE INTERESTED IN MEETING DES O’MALLEY, EVIDENTLY FEELING THAT AS THE MINISTER CONCERNED WITH LAW AND ORDER, AND WITH BORDER CONTROL, HE HAS MOST IN COMMON WITH HIM. HE ALSO BEGAN RUMINATING ON WHETHER MR WHITELAW COULD COME TO DUBLIN AND ON DETAILS SUCH AS WHETHER HE COULD LAND BY HELICOPTER AT GLENCAIRN. I CONFINED MYSELF TO SAYING THAT THESE AND OTHER POSSIBILITIES WOULD ONLY BE OPEN IF OUR IMPENDING SECURITY MEASURES IN THE NORTH WERE SUCCESSFUL AND CREATED THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE FOR POLITICAL PROGRESS: AND THAT, AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED, I WAS ABLE TO PUT UP ANY BRITISH MINISTER AT ANY TIME IN SECLUDED AND SECURE CONDITIONS AT GLENCAIRN AND COULD ENTERTAIN ANYONE HE LIKED.

1. AT ONE POINT MR LYNCH ASKED ME WHAT MORE HE COULD DO TO HELP. HE SUPPOSED THERE MIGHT BE AN INFLUX OF FUGITIVE IRA. THE SPECIAL COURTS WOULD CONTINUE TO FUNCTION, AND THE BORDER WOULD CONTINUE TO BE PATROLLED AND WATCHED. HE HAD ALREADY FOLLOWED UP A SUGGESTION I HAD MADE TO HILLERY, AND IN A SPEECH HE HAD JUST MADE HE HAD APPEALED FOR CALM SAYING THAT PRECIPITATE ACTION AND REACTION NOW COULD DETERMINE EVENTS AND ATTITUDES FOR A LONG TIME TO COME.

INVITED VIEWS ON POLITICALSOLUTIONS FROM ALL QUARTERS WITH THE AIM OF HOLDING A CONFERENCE IN THE AUTUMN. AT THE SAME TIME THE ACTIVITY OF THE SECURITY FORCES HAS BEEN KEPT TO A LOW LEVEL EVEN AT THE RISK OF MUCH MISUNDERSTANDING ON THE PART OF THE PROTESTANTS. IN SHORT, EVERYTHING POSSIBLE HAS BEEN DONE TO SET THE AFFAIRS OF THE PROVINCE ON A NEW COURSE. UNFORTUNATELY, OUR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN THWARTED BY THE ACTIONS 
OF THE PROVISIONAL IRA. DESPITE THE BRIEF CEASEFIRE, THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THEIR CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE, THAT THEY HAVE THE DELIBERATE AIM OF PREVETING RECONCiLIATION AND THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO USE EVERY METHOD OF INTIMIDATION TO DETER THE ROMAN CATHOLIC COMMUNITY FROM JOINING IN THE SEARCH FOR POLITICAL SOLUTIONS. IN DOING SO, THEY HAVE INEVITABLY PROVOKED EXTREMISTS AMONG THE PROTESTANTS WHO HAVE RESPONDED TO THE IRA CHALLENGE BY A MEASURE OF VIOLENCE AND BY SETTING UP THEIR OWN BARRICADES. THIS HAS PRODUCED A DANGEROUS SITUATION IN WHICH VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING, AND LAW AND ORDER PROGRESSIVELY BREAKING DOWN.

Londonderry was fairly quiet and the two Sunday rallies were both without incident. In the rural areas there was a wide variety of miner incidents, and some intersectarian trouble in Lurgan on Saturday. Elsewhere the move of reinforcements was completed without major snags by the early afternoon of Sunday. 
In GB, 
weekend press comment was full of speculation about the uses to which they might be put and when. SSNI made public statements on RTE on Friday evening and in Belfast on Sunday evening foreshadowing substantial military activity. These matters will be reported separately.

MR ARMSTRONG 
At their meeting this morning Ministers decided that my Secretary of State should give a final warning of the impending Operation Motorman at a late hour on Sunday night. 
As there was a fine balance of 
argument about the advantage of such a warning, much turns on the precise terms of that warning. 
The 
key passage in this respect is sidelined at the bottom of page 3 of the attached draft. 
The rest 
is subject to check for fact, though I think it is all right. 
I have sent a copy tonight by special messenger to Mr Whitelaw, and I am sending a copy to the Secretary of State for Defence, and also to the CGS, through the Ministry of Defence Resident Clerk. 
Should you wish to contact me, I shall be at home over the weekend lunchtime on Sunday, when I am due to go to Benson for Stormont.

OPERATIONS OF THE SECURITY FORCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
The security forces in Northern Ireland have taken 
steps to restore the authority of the law throughout the Province and to make sure that thesecurity-forces can operate freely in all areas. 
For 3 years Northern Ireland has been divided by communal strife and bitterness. 800 of its citizens have 
-been killed as-well-as 100 members of the security forces. Its cities and towns have been devastated by terrorist bombing and firing in the streets both by day and by night has become an ordinary feature of life in many parts of the country. This state of disorder cannot go on if the economic and social life of Northern Ireland are to continue in any meaningful form and for its law abiding citizens to enjoy the normal and peaceful life which is their right. 
Since the end of the cease fire alone members of the UDR and 
have been killed and soldiers, members of the RUC soldiers have been injured. 
civilians have lost their lives, most of them in the murderous bombing which took place on Friday 21 July when 
27 explosions occurred within a 31/2 hour period: an action N 
which as the Secretary said in the House of Commons 
on 24 July, must have deprived those who perpetrated them of any remaining shred of support."Even those sections of

NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 21 July - 27 July, 1972 
Memorandum by the Northern Ireland Office GENERAL 
1. The explosions in Belfast on the afternoon of 21 July have led to intensified operations by the security forces against the Provisional IRA. The bombings have been condemned by practically every section of opinion. The SDLP has agreed to meet the Government formally for discussion on the future. The UDA has broken away from the Ulster Vanguard over the latter’s call for a rent ad rates strike. It has also threatened to take action against the Provisionals and their "no-go" areas. Mr Faulkner has promised support for the Government if the present security policy is continued. 
REACTIONS TO FRIDAY’S EXPLOSIONS IN BELFST 
2. Following the bombings on Friday, the Provisional IRA issued a statement in which they claimed responsibility, but said adequate warnings were given. Their action, however, was universally condemned. Mr Whitelaw issued a statement on Friday deploring the "slaughter of men, women and children which took place today on Provisional IRA orders, clearly acting with the utmost ferocity. In the light of these murderous attacks, the Ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith". 
3. A debate on Northern Ireland took place on Monday at Westminster. During the debate, Mr Whitelaw said that in dealing with the IRA they were not dealing with a struggle between two communities, but with a force that as the enemy of them both. The Government had twin objectives in its policy for Northern Ireland: "Our first objective must be to destroy the capacities of the Provisional IRA who terrorise the community In destroying the IA’s capacity to terrorise the community, it must be our objective to maintain the understanding and goodwill of all communities in Northern Ireland. 
.......... Our second objective is to pursue urgently 
our aim of finding a new basis for the admnistration of Northern Ireland in which the minority will have a true part to play, and in which we can work towards measures that benefit Northern Ireland as a whole, rather than favouring one community or another." 
4. In a statement condemning the bombings, Mr Lynch asked for an immediate meeting as a matter of urgency of the political leaders of the North, London

27 July 1972 
The Rt Hon Sir Burke Trend GCB CVO Cabinet Office 70 Whitehall London S W 1 
At the end of this morning’s meeting of GEN 79 my Secretary of State made a plea for a study of some new arrangements which would enable the Government to avoid the great embarrassment of being forced back on to the Faulkner Government’s policy of search, arrest, interrogation and internment. 
I do not know 
how this will be followed up in the GEN 79 minutes, but you may like to have the attached document which sets out new possibilities. 
The basic problem is very simple. There are about 
100 terrorists against whom we could at once prefer legal charges if they were arrested, with a very good prospect of getting convictions against them by the ordinary processes of the law. 
There are about 
another 120 terrorists against whom we do not have sufficient evidence to prefer a charge, but might be chargeable if after arrest they were the subject of a reasonably short and entirely lawful interrogation. Third, there are about 80 terrorists, including most of the key ones, against whom we are not in a position to prefer charges of the normal sort partly because they do not themselves indulge over much in specific acts of terrorism, but rather organise them: partly because it is extremely difficult to get any evidence against them which will stand up in a court of law: and partly because the witnesses we might bring against them would all be in danger of their lives. 
In sum, we are in the position under the existing law and powers whereby we cannot deal with the key terrorists, even after we have caught them, other than by internment. 
And this, as you know, is a poison which might kill all further political initiatives.

Preventive Detention for Terrorist Conduct The capacity of the Provisional IRA (or of any other 
terrorist orgaisation) to engage in terrorism will not be effectively destroyed until all its important members are removed. It will be possible to charge some with criminal offences under the ordinary law; but others and perhaps the most important of them are beyond the reach of the criminal law partly because witnesses cannot be expected to come forward to give oral evidence in the ordinary way, and partly because the evidence available to connect accused persons with specific offences as opposed to general complicity in terrorism is sometimes tenuous,particularly in the case of the most important provisional IRA leaders. Any action we take must be such as not to alienate the minority community as a whole: a consideration which must rule out the further use of internment in the arbitrary form which it now takes under the Special Powers Act. 
The most promising possibility is to create a system 
of special courts whose function would not be to convict accused persons of criminal offences, but to judge whether they were guilty of certain specified conduct and commit them to "preventive detention" if they were.

OPERATION MOTORMAN 
The Secretary of State for Defence has requested me, acting for the Chief of the Defence Staff, to send to you the following directions, based on the decisions taken by Ministers on 27 July 1972 in respect of this operation. 
2. The aim of the operation is to restore law and order throughout the Province by making sure that there are no areas in which the Security Forces (normally)operate. 
3. The first step in this process is to introduce a strong military presence into those areas, which have recently been dominated by the IRA; and as seen as possible thereafter to ensure that there are no obstacles to free movement of any kind in any area in the Province, other than those required by the Security Forces for the purposes of security; and finally gradually to track down and pick up arms, ammunition, explosives and the active terrorists themselves. 
4. It must be made clear to all under your command that it is of vital importance that, in pursuit of your objectives, they should do all they can not only to avoid antagonising those who are not directly supporting the IRA but if possible to isolate the IRA from support by the population at large. This will not be easy, but it is of the greatest importance if the aim of the operation is to be achieved, both in the short and the long term. 
5. An essential element in this is that there should be no departure from the overriding principle that only the minimum force necessary to achieve the immediate aim should be used, and that the acts of individual soldiers, as of the Army at large should be seen to be in support of law and order. the must therefore be within the law. Commanders at all levels, in deciding the degree of force which is to be used, must bear in mind the importance of minimising the risk of casualties among innocent civilians and of damage to their property, as well as the risks to their own soldiers. 
6. The Secretary of State for Defence is fully confident that all under your command will conduct themselves with the discipline, restraint courage and skill which has been so conspicuous a hallmark of the Army in Northern Ireland over the last three years.

DRAFT MESSAGE FROM G.O.C. TO BRIGADE COMMANDERS All soldiers in Northern Ireland are very rightly 
conscious of the constraints which are placed upon us by the need to use minumum and reasonable force. 
We must operate within the law. As we approach a new phase of operations, 
I am writing to reassure you about our position. The circumstances under which a soldier operates here are and it is important 
well understood 
to get into perspective the legal problem of the use of force. It is not possible to lay down general rules for all particular situations, but the soldier’s guiding principle in all circumstances is simply to take reasonable action in order to protect his own life and the lives of others. 
If 
the soldier acts reasonably and responsibly, he is not at risk in the courts. The Yellow Card provides guidance which, if followed, With 
should ensure that the soldier acts lawfully. 
specific reference to paragraph 12 of the Yellow Card, soldiers may fire without warning if there is no other way to protect themselves or those whom it is their duty to protect from the danger of being killed or seriously injured. 
Moreover, 
for this operation only, a company commander may order the firing of heavy weapons (such as Carl Gustav) against positions from which there is sustained hostile firing, if he believes that this is necessary for the preservation of the lives of soldiers or of other persons whom it is his duty to protect. 
In deciding whether or not to use heavy weapons full 
account must be taken of the risk that the opening of fire may endanger the lives of innocent persons.

GEN 79 The memorandum by the CGS discusses two possible military 
operations designed to take advantage of the mood of public opinion generated by the bombing atrocities of Friday, 21st July. 2. 
The first question which Ministers will need to decide is whether this advantage should in fact be taken - or whether we should try to regard 
"Bloody Friday" as a hiccough in the middle of the detente deriving from the cease-fire, which was admittedly a violent interruption of that process but should not be allowed to deflect us from our long-term purpose of promoting political reconciliation. The SDLP decision to take part in the Secretary of State’s discussions is a new and additional argument in favour of not being so deflected; and, taken in conjunction with the curious quietness of the IRA since the 21st, it may suggest that the chance of resuming political advance is still open 
- provided that we do not ourselves 
reject it by military action against the IRA which might alienate the great bulk of the Roman Catholic population. But this may be mere wishful thinking, politically deceptive and militarily dangerous. And, if Ministers judge that the political and military risk is too great to be taken, they must consider the alternative course of firm military action in one of the two forms which the CGS recommends. 3. 
The first option is an operation designed to reoccupy the Bogside 
and Creggan areas of Londonderry, while maintaining no more than a holding position in Belfast. It would require three additional major units and a troop of four Armoured Vehicles Royal Engineers (AVRE). It could be mounted as early as Sunday, 30th July, although the small hours of Monday, 31st July are preferred in order to avoid the semi-anniversary of "Bloody Sunday". The second option is an operation not only to reoccupy the Bogside and Creggan but also to increase the military presence in Belfast (particularly in Andersonstown and Ballymurphy) and elsewhere in the Province. This operation would require a further four major units; and could be mounted, together with the simultaneous operation in Londonderry, in the small hours of Wednesday, 2nd August. 4. 
State, although ready to accept the full reinforcement of seven battalions, inclines to the first option, at least to the extent that he would prefer to confine operations initially to Londonderry and to await reactions before 
The Army favour the second of these two options. The Secretary of

26th July, 1972 NORTHERN IRELAND: DRAFT RULES OF ENGAGEMENT Further to my letter earlier today enclosing a copy of 
CGS’ paper on Army Operations in Northern Ireland, I am now sending you a copy of two draft amendments to the Rules of Engagement which the CGS agreed informally with the Attorney General on their return journey from Northern Ireland last evening. 
The Defence Secretary is content with these amendments. On 
2, he considers that the amendment is acceptable in the particular circumstances of the operation in question, and subject to the conditions and safeguards embodied within it. But he would be grateful if he could have the Prime Minister’s agreement, and also that of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Attorney General, to the two new draft Rules during the course of tomorrow since they will need to be incorporated in the Operational Orders. (For convenience a photocopy of the existing Yellow Card is enclosed.)

Note of a Meeting on 25 July 
ARMY OPERATIONS AND INFORMATION POLICY Information about recent patrols in the Bogside is best handled in 
Northern Ireland. Ministers in yesterday’s debate warned that the Provisionals would try to make propaganda out of the intensified Army operations. There are local arrangements for dealing with complaints arising out of search operations. The possibility of using photographs to rebut spurious allegations will be kept in mind. The Attorney-General is holding a meeting in Northern Ireland to-day. 
2. The Northern Ireland Office is considering the possibility of distri- 
buting widely the newspaper reports of Friday’s bomb attacks in Belfast together with the article in Dublin’s "Sunday Independent" quoted by S. of S. for Northern Ireland in his speech opening the debate yesterday. 
GENERAL TUZO’s SUCCESSOR 3. 
The Ministry of Defence propose to agree that Lieutenant-General 
Sir Frank King should be interviewed for the "Belfast Telegraph" on the basis that he will be unable to talk about Northern Ireland and that the resulting article will be shown to the Ministry of Defence before it is published.

WE HAVE JUST LEARNT FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE IRISH LABOUR PARTY THAT ON 7 JULY MR WHITELAW HAD HALF AN HOUR’S CONVERSATION WITH CONNOR CRUISE O’BRIEN, THE MOST OUTSPOKEN OPPOSITION CRITIC OF MR LYNCHS POLICY TOWARDS NORTHERN IRELAND, WE MUST ASSUME THAT MR LYNCH ALSO KNOWS THIS. COMING ON TOP OF THE TALKS WITH THE PROVISIONAL I.R.A. AND THE LATTER’S CONVERSATION WITH MR WILSON, THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT TOLD MR LYNCH OF THE CONVERSATION, HELPS TO EXPLAIN HIS GROWING SCEPTICISM ABOUT THE SINCERITY OF OUR DESIRE TO KEEP IN CLOSE CONTACT: AND THE GROWING CONVICTION THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO TALK TO ANYONE FROM THE REPUBLIC EXCEPT THE LAWFULLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT. THE DESPATCH OF DR HILLERY TO LONDON WAS PRESUMABLY INTENDED AS AN ATTEMPT TO INITIATE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION AND A POLITICAL DEMONSTRATION THAT THE IRISH HAD A TOE IN THE DOOR. 
2. 
I WOULD APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH IF THIS EMBASSY COULD BE KEPT INFORMED OF CONTACTS WITH PROMINENT IRISH POLITICAL FIGURES , WHETHER LONDON OR BELFAST. 
3. INCIDENTALLY, I AM NOT SURE THAT DURING THE MEETING REPORTED IN YOUR TELEGRAM NO 173, DR HILLERY GAVE A COMPLETE OR ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF MR LYNCH’S VIEWS. EACH MINISTER HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND EMPHASIS, AND DR HILLERY IS MORE INCLINED THAN MOST TO EXPRESS VIEWS NOT FAR REMOVED FROM THOSE OF THE PROVISIONALS. THIS ADDS POINT TO THE SUGGESTION FOR A REGULAR, 
EVEN THOUGH INFORMAL AND 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, LIAISON BETWEEN THE IRISH GOVERNMENT AND THE MINISTER FOR NORTHERN IRELAND.

24 JULY INFO (ROUTINE) DUBLIN, UKREP BELFAST, WASHINGTON. SECRETARY-GENERAL’S COMMENTS ON NORTHERN IRELAND 
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY SHORTLY AFTER H I S RETURN FROM MOSCOW. (THIS HAS NOW BECOME STANDARD PROCEDURE AFTER HIS TOURS ABROAD). AFTER A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BOMBING OF DIKES IN NORTH VIETNAM, HE WAS ASKED, IN A VERY SLANTED QUESTION, WHETHER HE WAS QUOTE CONCERNED ABOUT CIVILIAN LIVES BEING CONSTANTLY DESTROYED IN STRIFE IN IRELAND? UNQUOTE HE REPLIED: QUOTE OH YES, I AM DEEPLY WORRIED AND CONCERNED BY THE DEVELOPMENTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND. I THINK A SECRETARYGENERAL CANNOT AVOID TO BE DEEPLY SHOCKED BY THE HUMAN SUFFERING IN NORTHERN IRELAND. I HAD HOPED THAT THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS WOULD LEAD TO A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF THE PROBLEM BUT UNFORTUNATLY THIS SEEMS NOT TO BE THE CASE. AS IT STANDS NOV NEW VIOLENCE BROKE OUT AND ENORMOUS HUMAN SUFFERING RESTARTED, SO I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THIS DEVELOPMENT. AS YOU KNOW, I OFFERED MY GOOD OFFICES IN THE PAST AND THE HELP OF THE UN BUT I WAS INFORMED BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT SOME TIME AGO ALREADY THAT THIS PROBLEM DOES NOT LEND ITSELF TO UN INVOLVEMENT, REFERRING TO ARTICLE 2 PARAGRAPH 7 OF THE CHARTER. BUT I WISH TO REPEAT IN CONNECTION WITH THE NEVEST SAD DEVELPMENTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT I AM STILL READY TO OFFER MY GOOD OFFICES AND THAT WE WILL ALWAYS HELP IF THIS IS THE WISH OF THE PARTIES UNQUOTE.

1. THE FOLLOWING IS THE IRISH TIMES ACCOUNT OF A RADIO INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE TAOISEACH YESTERDAY, 23 JULY. 
"MR LYNCH SAID THAT AFTER THE INCIDENTS OF LAST FRIDAY THE NORTHERN SITUATION HAD BECOME MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN IT HAD BEEN FOR A LONG TIME. OBVIOUSLY THE TIME HAD COME FOR TALKS. THIS SHOULD BE DONE AND DONE QUICKLY. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SAY GHAT ADVANTAGES COULD BE GOT FROM TALKS WITH THE IRA. HOWEVER, IT HAD SAID THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A POLITICAL SOLUTION. VIOLENCE WAS THE VERY OPPOSITE. IT WOULD PROLONG THE AGONY. FURTHER TALKS WITH THE IRA WAS A MATTER FOR MR WHITELAW. HE WAS THE BEST JUDGE. ’’BUT HE HAS HAD ONE DISAPPOINTMENT AND I DO NOT KNOW IF HE WILL BE INCLINED TO TALK AGAIN. IT IS NOT FOR ME TO INDICATE WHAT HE SHOULD DO. THE HEATH INITIATIVE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL GESTURE BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. HAD IT BEEN ACTED ON BY ALL SIDES, PARTICULARLY THE IRA, IT WOULD HAVE PRODUCED A SITUATION IN WHICH THEY COULD FIND AN ULTIMATE SOLUTION. THE IRA SHOULD BE REALISTIC AND ACT UPON IT. 
ASKED IF HE WOULD LIKE A DECLARATION OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, MR LYNCH SAID THAT THE GUARANTEES IN THE IRELAND ACTS INDICATED TO UNIONISTS THAT THEY WERE IN AN IMPREGNABLE POSITION, HE HAD URGED THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO INDICATE THAT THEY WOULD WELCOME THE ULTIMATE REUNIFICATION OF IRELAND AS A SOLUTION, 
AND 
WORK TOWARDS IT. INSTEAD THEIR ATTITUDE HAD BEEN THAT SO LONG AS THE PEOPLE IN THE NORTH DID NOT WANT IT, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE IT. MANY UNIONISTS WERE NOW THINKING IN TERMS OF ULTIMATE REUNIFICATION AS A SOLUTION, AND THE BRITISH OPPOSITION WERE THINKING ALONG THAT LINE. IT WOULD THUS BE POSSIBLE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND HE WAS THINKING OF PEOPLE RATHER THAN OF THE REUNIFICATION OF TERRITORY. THEY MUST GET PEOPLE TALKING AND RECONCILE THEM TO EACH OTHER.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 210700 TO 240700 JULY 1972 General 
1. Bloody Friday has dominated the weekends’ Ulster events. The Belfast bombing was intense, city wide and violent. Most of the bombs were in cars, and were directed against communications. There was no obvious point of retaliation but intense military activity started on Friday night and continued throughout the weekend with the aim of preventing any serious Protestant action against the Catholic community and to restore public cnfidence in the Security Forces. Scores of arrests were made by the Army under Regulation 11 (ie on suspicion) and then handed over to the RUC. Where criminal charges could not be preferred, those arrested (the vast majority) were released, but the general propaganda effect of our operations was good. The most successful of the search operations resulted in the discovery of an IRA bomb factory in the Markets area of Belfast by 1WG on Sunday. Significant numbers of gunmen have been hit throughout the Province over the weekend-26 hits are claimed - but the total roll of our casualties, including the bombing on Bloody Friday, number 2 SF killed, 17 SF wounded with 13 civilians killed and 145 injured. In GB, weekend press comment was limited by the industrial action, but on balance most if not all those papers which were published recommended that the time had clearly come for more severe but clearly selective measures against the Provisional IRA. In the Republic, Thomas acGill the President of Official Sinn Fein tried to visit London but was refused entry ’for reasons of national security’. The mid Cork bye election is in full swing. 
2. During FRI/SAT 21/22 JUL 72. There were 131 shooting incidents, 103 of of which involved SF. There were 39 explosions most of which occurred in Belfast in a 31/2 hour period after 1430hrs. The Belfast explosions resulted in the deaths of 9 civilians and 2 soldiers and at least 130 civilians were injured. During the period 5 civilians died as a result of GSW, 11 soldiers were wounded and SF claimed to have hit 15 gunmen. In an arrest operation, 148 people were taken in for questioning. 
3. During SAT/SUN 22/23 JUL 72. There were 79 shooting incidents, 58 of which involved SF. There were 14 explosions. 1 civilian was killed, 1 UDR soldier was wounded and there were 4 minor RUC casualties. 1 gunman was wounded and detained, and SF claimed to have hit 5 other gunmen. Search operations continued and a relatively large quantity of arms and ammunition was found. A number of arrests were made and about 30 men wore detained.

7 July 1972 I am sorry not to have replied before to 
your letter of 30 June about paragraph 3 of Dublin telegram No. 448 on arrest policy. We see some danger in a sensitive and volatile situation of encouraging the close co-ordination referred to be too specific and I have ventured to recast the draft letter to John Peck. I hope you would agree that this would be the right line to take. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Stephens at the Ministry of Defence.

All Special Branch Offices. The accompanying list of persons whose arrest is sought is forwarded 
for information. It contains the names and addresses of all persons in respect of whom there is evidence of their involvement in commission of crimes, and against whom, in some cases, warrants to arrest have been issued. It shall be referred to as Category 1 List. 
The list is being limited to the above circulation for the present, as 
it is hoped to replace it with a full detailed list, giving full particulars, photographswhere available etc., within the next week. 
It is hoped to follow with the circulation of a Category 2 list which will 
contain the names of all those persons in respect of whom there is hard intelligence indicating their involvement in the commission of crimes but no evidence. In the meantime action on earlier Wanted Lists circulated from this Office is suspended, but all such lists should be securely retained pending instructions.

c.c. Mr Woodfield Mr Cairncross 
Sir William Nield I attended a meeting on 25th July at which the Attorney General 
with representatives of the Army, the RUC and others proposals which the Army have been putting forward for strengthening certain of their powers under the Special Powers Act and in particular for clarifying their powers of arrest and interrogation. 2. 
The discussion was confined to the latter and was not related to any 
particular scale of operations. We did not get on to the other questions of which we had had advance notice, such as curfews and stopping individuals and vehicles crossing the border; nor was there any discussion of indemnity. 3. 
It was disturbing to discover that even at this stage there is a good 
deal of confusion about the Army’s powers of arrest and interrogation and there still seems to be a large differing of legal views on the subject. The meeting eventually agreed that revised draft regulations - not incorporating any substantial changes - should be prepared in an attempt to clarify the position. The Army and the RUC are to produce a draft which can be looked at from both the legal and political angles. 4. 
In the course of a lengthy discussion it emerged that the Army must make 
a large proportion of their arrests under Regulation 11 (detention) rather than under Regulation 10 under which a man can be held for interrogation for 48 hours. 5. 
Up to now it has been understood that a man arrested under Regulation 11 
could be held legally for only 24 hours before being charged, released or having a detention order made against him. A legal judgement made some little time ago has called this into question and the Attorney General considered that there was/ no legal limit on the time which a man could be held under Regulation 11 before he was charged, released or detained. He also took the view that a man so held could be questioned 
in doubt. Mr Johnston was anxious to preserve a distinction between - a point which has apparently been

Secretary of state The meeting which the Attorney General held on 25th July to 
consider proposals by the Army for extending their powers under the Special Powers Act turned out to be little more than a mainly legal discussion of their existing powers of arrest and interrogation. A particular point emerged on which instructions are required. 2. 
The broad pattern of arrest and questioning in the past has 
been for suspects to be arrested under Regulation 10 and interrogated for 48 hours. Some have then been re-arrested under 
Regulation 11 and it has been understood that they then had to be charged, released or 
The legal view now being taken is that there is no limit on the period under which a man can be held 
under 
Regulation 11 without a detention order but There are obvious political objections to making th 
period very long. 3. A substantial proportion of the arrests made by the Army 
in future operations will be under Regulation 11. This means that unless there is some extension of the limited period previously thought to be available for questioning under Regulation 11 interrogation will be restricted to 24 hours. Any extension can be made by administrative decision. 4. 
cases to be extended to five day 
The Army and the RUC are pressing for the period in some Questioning 
under the Judges Rules. Although the Attorney General made it abundantly clear that questioning must nevertheless 
be lawful,interrogation or a period of five days would give rise and 
to a good deal of suspicion/to many allegations of brutality, particularly as suspects will be held incommunicado. But a 
within 24 hours of being so arrested.

4. The Army and the RUC are pressing for the period in some 
cases to be extended to five days. Questioning would not necessarily be under the Judges Rules. Although the Attorney General made it abundantly clear that questioning must nevertheless be lawful, interrogation over a period of five days would give rise to a good deal of suspicion and to many allegations of brutality, particularly as suspects will be held incommunicado. But a period of three days would be no longer than the period for which men have been held in the past under a combination of Regulation 10 and Regulation 11. It is suggested therefore that you should agree that suspects arrested under Regulation 11 may now be held for questioning for up to 72 hours before being charged, released or made the subject of a detention order. Where arrests are made under Regulation 10 in the first instance the total period should still not exceed 72 hours. 5. 
The Attorney General would support this proposal.

Mr Jack We spoke about the attached documents and, in particular, the 
Army’s interpretation of our instructions on arrest policy set out in their letter of 28 June which Sir William Nield asked me to look at. 
There are two points which worry me. These are: 
(a) Paragraph (b) of the Army letter envisages that persons may be arrested under Regulation 10 "for purposes of questioning prior to preferment of criminal charges". I am uncertain whether an arrest for such purposes would properly be within the powers conferred by Regulation 10. When we redrafted the main policy document, our main object was to preserve the powers of arrest under Regulation 11(1); these powers contemplate that persons so arrested could, in certain circumstances, be brought before the courts and the powers of arrest relate to any person whom the arresting officer "suspects of acting or of having acted or being about to act in a manner prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or the maintenace of order" and so on. To my mind, there is no doubt that the Army could arrest a person under these powers for the purpose of bringing that person before the courts. I am less sure about Regulation 10 where the arrest must specifically be for "interrogation". Further, the Lord Chief Justice has made i clear that the courts are unlikely to regard as admissable in criminal proceedings statements made by persons arrested and interrogated under Regulation 10. I do not know what is said in the Blue Card but I wonder whether it would not be better to miss out (b) altogether since the Army will have more than enough powers of arrest under Regulation 11 and no question of proceedings for wrongful arrest could arise in the exercise of those powers if the person was subsequently brought before the courts. If, however, for presentational reasons, the Army wish to keep a reference to Regulation 10, it would be better to refer to it in paragraph (c); but the words used by the arresting officer should nevertheless refer to Regulation 10 and 11. 
(b) 
I am not altogether happy about the wording of paragraph (c) in the Army letter. It says that arrests are to be made "in respect of conduct and not simply membership of an illegal organisation". The reference to "conduct" is, in my view, quite correct since the arrest power is attached to various types of prejudicial behaviour. The reference to "membership of an illegal organisation" is, however, unhappy since strictly no such arrest should properly be made under Regulation 11. The object of the wording is possibly to refer obliquely to Regulation 24(A) 
- but this regulation is, as I understand it, 
much observed in the breach as a result of rather perverse decision of the courts recently that membership of the Provisional wing did not constitute membership of the IRA. If the letter of 28 June is to be redrafted, I think it better to omit the words "and not simply membership of an illegal organisation".
