Incidents in the last 24 hours The period was generally quiet. There were two explosions in 
Belfast, one of which badly damaged a shoe shop and warehouse near the city centre; while, outside Belfast, an explosion severely damaged a transformer at Bessbrook. A primed but unignited incendiary device was found outside an Orange Lodge four miles east of Cookstown. Two petrol bombs were thrown in Belfast, and a nail bomb in Londonderry. 2. 
There were four shooting incidents, three of them in Belfast 
in two of which the fire was returned, with a gunman thought to have been hit in each case 
- and the remaining one in Londonderry. Some 
ammunition and gelignite were found in the Ligoniel area of Belfast, and a small quantity of bomb making material in the Creggan area of Londonderry. 3. 4. 
A total of 28 wanted persons were arrested during the period. A firm of dry cleaners in Londonderry has reported that about 
157 sets of Army combat clothing were stolen during the weekend. The Irish Press, in a front page article, stated that the suits were in the hands of the Official IRA and would be distributed to IRA training camps. Internee accommodation and attempted escapes 5. 
Despite the recurrence of attempts by internees to escape from 
Crumlin Road Prison, the Northern Ireland authorities are not at present pursuing an active policy of transferring the more dangerous or militant internees away from Crumlin Road to Long Kesh. This is apparently due partly to little having yet been done to categorise thi internees, and partly to reluctance to move them about any more than can be avoided while the numbers are still swelling and the custodial

The Agenda The most urgent item concerns the replies to the 
letters from the Labour Party about inter-Party talks. The Committee will wish to receive the usual reports on the current security situation; but we have put these later in the agenda in order to allow time for some discussion of our general political posture, which it seems important to consider before Parliament reassembles.

NOTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 50 
7 JANUARY 1972 Incidents in the last 24 hours The period was comparatively quiet, There were three instances 
of Army mobile Patrols coming under fire in country areas. In two of these cases the shots came from across the border; on each occasion fire was returned and in one of the cases it is believed that one gunman was almost certainly hit and possibly a second. There were also three shooting incidents in Belfast, where no casualties resulted. 2. 
A house was burned down on the north-weest side of Loch Neagh 
following a small explosion; and there were two explosions in Newry. In Belfast three minor explosions took place, causing some damege but no casualties. 3. 
A total of eighteen wanted men were arrested. These included 
eight men caught in a cordon and search operation in the Andersonstown area, based on information from Special Branch; six of them are identifiable as members of A company, 1st Battalion of the Provisional IRA. Others arrested during the period included two quartermasters of the Goulding wing and a suspected member of an IRA Active Service Unit. 
Attitude of Official IRA 4. 
There is reason to believe that at least some members of the Official wing are planning to resort to more violent activities - both 
in Northern Ireland and, perhaps later, in the Republic. This presumably means that their anxiety to seem no less militant than the Brady wing is tending to out-weigh their an conviction that the Provisionals’ reliance on violence is doomed to failure. The Officials are reported to be recruiting vigorously in Londonderry Prosecutions for unauthorised marches 5.

involving marches from rallying points which were in defiance of the ban on processions. This may well provoke reaction from Paisleyite elements who have been active in marches in the past. A soldier was killed by sniper fire in Belfast on 5 January. In the Republic, some of the United Nations forces in Cyprus have been recalled and a contingent of them has arrived home. 
SPEECH BY THE NORTHERN IRELAND MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE 
2. Mr Harry West, the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture, in a speech to a Unionist meeting in Co. Antrim, said that the border with the Republic should be sealed off completely by troops, with access to Northern Ireland allowed only on production of personal identification or a valid passport. The principle of a civilianised and unarmed police force could perhaps have had the effect of destroying the spirit, effectiveness and capability of the RUC. These must be restored. He also is reported as saying that there was a lack of real determination by the British Government to bring the IRA campaign to a speedy and successful end and seems to have cast doubts whether the security undertakings given in the Downing Street Declaration had been fulfilled. 
LEGISLATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND TO PROVIDE FOR A DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS 
3. The Prosecution of Offences Bill, published at Stormont, is 
intended to make new provision for the prosecution of offences in Northern Ireland. In particular, it provides for the appointment by the Governor of a Director and Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions and, by the Ministry of Home Affairs, of professional staff to assist the Director, with area offices where the Director may consider it necessary. It would be the duty of the Director to consider what prosecutions should be brought for all but minor offences. Certain functions would be shared between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney-General, but the Director would be responsible for the due performance of his functions to the Attorney-General, who would accordingly be answerable in Parliament for the performance of the functions of the Director and his department.

Incidents in the last 24 hours There were eleven shooting incidents during 
period, including 
four in Belfast and four in londonderry. A soldier of 1 Gloucesters was shot dead while on patrol in the Divis area of Belfast, and in the Creggan area of Londonderry a soldier was wounded in the shoulder in each case by a single shot from a sniper. South-east of Newry, a mobile patrol came under automatic fire from across the border, 50 or 60 shots being fired. There were three outbreaks of minor rioting in Belfast, with hooligans throwing stones at troos. 2. 
A Saracen armoured car was damaged by a claymore mine near 
Crossmaglen; the driver was slightly injured. In Belfast four civilians were injured when a bomb exploded after being thrown at an Army land rover. At Sion Mills a transformer was superficially damaged by an explosion. 3. 
4. 
An armed robbery took place in Lisburn, £1,500 being taken. Searches in the Divis area of Belfast, based on information 
received, uncovered two caches of arms - wich included two submachineguns, four shotguns, 2 revolvers and nearly 2,000 rounds of ammunition and cartridges. Two 15 lb bags of blasting powder were found near Dungannon. 5. 
Fifteen wanted men were arrested during the period.

Northern Ireland The Official Committee on Northern Ireland met this morning to 
prepare for the next Ministerial discussion, which should not be later, I think, than the early part of next week. The most important of the outstanding issues is the present situation as regards the proposed interParty talks. Since the Home Secretary saw Mr. Callaghan before Christmas he has received two letters on the subject. The first was from Mr. Callaghan himself on 30 December and asks the Home Secretary, in effect, to confirm Mr. Callaghan’s understanding that there would be no barrier to the discussion of any relevant topic which any one of the Parties represented might wish to raise. The Home Secretary considers that he has already covered this point by making public his New Year message to Mr. Faulkner, in which he confirmed that the agenda for the discussions would be open. The other letter is from Sir Harry Nicholas, informing the Home Secretary of a resolution of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party passed on 22 December to the effect that the NEC condemned the policy of internment and the methods of interrogation revealed by the Compton Report; urged the Government to confirm that the inter-Party talks proposed would be open-ended and to convene them immediately thereafter; and recorded the view that "the continuation of internment of British subjects without charge or trial is an impediment to the success of any political initiative". The resolution therefore endorses, by implication, the SDLP line that internment must end before they can take part in talks. I understand that the Home Secretary proposes to consult his colleagues before replying to either of these communications. This certainly needs to be done before Parliament resumes at the latest; and the question of the Government’s attitude towards inter-Party talks might, I suggest, be the principal item for a meeting next week, unless you want to take the opportunity to raise it after the DOP meeting tomorrow, when the Home Secretary and the Defence Secretary will be available. 2. 
Other topics mentioned at the meeting this morning were:(a) The security situation. It was reported that the IRA are showing 
signs of suffering from attrition; and that the future policy of the Provisionals may be to concentrate on fewer, but larger, explosive attacks, while the Officials are more likely to concentrate

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT N0 47 4 JANUARY 1972 
Incident in the lastt 24 hours The main event was an explosion in the central shopping area of 
Belfast which caused injuries to between 50 and 60 people. A bomb had been attached’to a hijacked brewery lorry which was then parked in a fairly narrow street near to some large shops. The bomb itself was small by recent standards - 
estimated at about ten pounds of gelignite - and did little damage to the surrounding buildings; most 
of the injuries were caused by flying glass. Unlike practically all previous cases of deliberate bombings in the city, no prior warning was given on this occasion 
- which of course accounts for the 
unusually large number of casualties. The injured were mainly women and children; six women are still in hospital. 2. 
There were only a few other incidents during the period. Two 
shots were fired and two bombs thrown at a military patrol in Belfast, as a result of which three youths were arrested. Near Newry an RUC patrol car was fired on (without casualties) from a car which then escaped over the border. There were sporadic outbreaks of hooliganism and minor rioting in Londonderry during the day and in Lurgan late in the evening. A bank robbery took place in the Lower Falls area of Belfast, when about £7,500 was taken, and a mail bag containing £600 was stolen from a bus near Lurgan. 3. 
Following the raid on the St. Mary’s Social Club on the previous 
night (Report No. 46), the screening of the people found there was completed during the morning. Twenty men were identified as possible IRA activists tion - 
- apparently all in the Official wing of the organisaand detained for further questioning at Police Holding Centres

Incidents in the last 72 hours The weekend was relatively quiet. On Sunday, the NIORA Anti- 
Internment Rally passed off without incident, and was successfully prevented from forming a marching column for any distance at a time. It seems certain, nevertheless, that it will be seen by the Protestant community as an illegal march which the authorities failed to prevent, and it may accordingly frm an awkward precedent when the main season for the traditional marches comes along. 2. 
and searched for wanted men; after 70 people had been screened, four were found to be wanted - 
including two company commanders of the 
Provisional IRA in Belfast. A similar operation in the north of Belfast on Sunday night met with resistance, and some damage to property, before the screening could be carried out: two men were finally arrested. 3. 
On Saturday night a club in the Ardoyne was successfully cordoned r Shooting incidents recurred throughout the weekend, the majority 
being in Belfast. On Friday there were six in the city, in one of which a former British soldier was attacked by masked men in his home; on Saturday there were eight, in one of which a gunman was seen to be hit when a patrol opened fire in the Ardoyne; and on Sunday there were four, in one of which two soldiers of 1 KOSB were slightly wounded by gunfire from a passing ar in Springfield Road. 4. 
Outside Belfast, shots were fired at two RUC stations on Friday, 
at Belleek (where the shots came from across the border) and at Coalisland. On Saturday a mobile patrol came under fire from across

Incidents in the last 24 hours Outbreaks of violence remained at about the same level as/the 
previous two days with shooting continuing to overshadow explosions. In the Falls area of Belfast a former British Serviceman (O’Toole, aged twenty, who was discharged half-way through a six-year engagement with the Royal Irish Rangers) was snatched into a car by three men, taken round the corner and shot in both legs - 
leaving him 
seriously wounded. He is now in hospital. There were three other shooting incidents in Belfast. 2. 
In Londonderry there was again sporadic rioting during the day. 
Troops opened fire on a young nail-bomber, and there were four other shooting incidents. There was also shooting on the road north of Warrenpoint, Co. Down. There was one armed robbery near Newry. 3. A pumphouse near Forkill was destroyed by an explosion. In Londonderry there was one explosion, at the north end of the city, and a fire at a bakery. 4. 
Two rifles and over 1,000 rondsof assorted ammunition were 
found in the Andersonstown area of Belfast; and there were three other discoveries of small caches of arms. 5. 6. 
Nine wantpd persons were arrested during the period. It is reported that a vetern IRA member - Jack McCabe- was kille 
in Dublin while in the act of preparing explosive charges; details are not yet available. Proposed NICRA march on 2 January 7. 
NICRA have announced their intention to stage a full-scale 
march in Belfast on Sunday, with groups converging from various area of the city to a rally in the Falls. Vanessa Redgrave apparently intends to take part.

Conversation between the Prime of Ireland on Sunday 30 
and the Prime Minister of the Mr. L. Lynch here. 
I am sorry to ring you at this hour unfortunate 
but you will probably have heard the/news about Derry this afternoon. Mr. H. It is very bad news, yes. M. L. Very bad news, yes. 
And from reactions received 
around the country at the moment it looks as if a very serious point has now been reached and the situation could 
escalate beyond what any of us would anticipate at this to 
stage. I am told that, according/reports I received and 
checked out on the spot, the British troops reacted rather beyond what a disciplined force might be expected to, and, as you know, there were 13 killed and as many again injured. 
So, judging by what I have heard around 
the country and from reports, a very very serious situation could emerge from all this. I would like to suggest here at this stage that some serious political action might be taken on your part and even to the point of taking, first of all taking over the control of the security forces from Westminster and taking over in some way in Stormont itself. 
I am saying this now because it is something 
that I have been urging on you before but I think the situation has now been reached that there will be a very very serious reaction in our country tomorrow. 
one of 
all I am told on good authority that/the British newspapers will describe this tomorrow as a massacre and will even go so far as to say that the British troops went berserk. So, you can imagine what the Irish people will think, what all the people here will think about it. 
In the meantime we have whatever numbness or lull there is in First of

MESSAGE NO 3 OF 30 JANUARY 1972 NO 10 TO CHEQUERS CONFIDENTIAL FROM LORD BRIDGES TO PRIME MINISTER 
LONDONDERRY RIOT 
LATEST CONFIRMED REPORTS RECEIVED IN MINISTRY OF DEFENCE ARE THAT ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE KILLED IN LONDONDERRY THIS AFTERNOON AND A FURTHER TWELVE IN HOSPITAL. THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM REPORT CARRIED BY AGENCIES THAT TWELVE WERE KILLED: THIS IS BASED ON A STATEMENT MADE BY SPOKESMAN FOR A LONDONDERRY HOSPITAL, WHO SAID THAT THE TWELVE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN DEAD WITH GUNSHOT WOUNDS AND ALL WERE IN THEIR EARLY 20S. 
ACCORDING TO THE MOD, TROOPS WERE FIRED ON BY SNIPERS NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE MARCH, THE ARMY RETURNED FIRE AT THOSE SHOOTING AT THEM, NOT INTO THE CROWD AS MISS DEVLIN SAYS. 
IF ANY FURTHER REPORTS REACH THE MOD FROM ARMY UNIT COMMANDERS THIS EVENING, WE WILL TELEPRINT THE GIST TO YOU.

NORTHERN JANUARY 1972 Icidents in the last 24 hours For the first time for nearly three weeks explosions played a 
more prominent part than shooting incidents. Altogether there were some 23 explosions during the period. In Belfast a new telephone exchange in Grosvenor Road was extensively damaged by a large bomb which was smuggled in as a parcel in a van; 
an antique shop in 
Dublin Road was destroyed; and a petrol station in the suburb of Dunmurry was badly damaged by a double explosion. Outside the city, explosions aused extensive damage to three telephone exchanges two transformers and two council offices, as well as to various commercial premises 
- full details of which are not yet available. 
Five of the explosions were in Newry. On the border two Customs posts were destroyed. 2. 
In Londonderry there were no explosions but nine outbreaks of 
shooting at troops in the Boside; there were no casualties. 3. 
In the Lower Falls area of Belfast a search uncovered two rifles, 
three pistols and a shotgun together with 2378 rounds of assorted ammunition and some cordex fuse. 4. 
There were twelve arrests of wanted persons. In addition, two 
suspected IRA members were among a number of people arrested in Andersonstown after two caymore-type devices had been detonated at a barricade. Machinegun attack in Lurgan on 24 January 5. 
The RUC have confirmed that the nineteen-year-old Protestant 
youth who was attacked by gunmen in his home on 24 January was not due to give evidence as a Crown witness, i.e. that there was no reason to silence him on this score. The reason for the attack therefore remains unclear.

Northern Ireland (GEN 47) 
Item 1: Inter-Party Talks (GEN 47(72) 2) The memorandum by the Chairman of the Official Committee sets 
out the main points that the Meeting will want to bear in mind. While it is 
obviously to the Government’s advantage to maintain a bipartisan approach for as long as possible, at least so far as the Shadow Cabinet are concerned, the use of the inter-Party talks for that purpose must imply that the Government are prepared to put their cards on the table, at least to some extent. Are they so prepared? The answer must depend largely on:(a) The decision on what our cards are 
- i. e. the decision whether 
or not we proceed with the Home Secretary’s plan (which is for further discussion under Item 2); and, if we do, whether or not we link it with Mr. Lynch’s initiative. 
(b) The fact that, so far as Mr. Lynch’s initiative is concerned, Mr. Lynch has already disclosed it, in outline, to the Leader of the Opposition. 
(c) The probability that the Opposition’s motive in any case is more likely to be a desire to claim the credit for coercing the Government into a discussion of Mr. Wilson’s 15 points than any wish to help the Government in launching a plan which the Government themselves have devised. 
2. In the light of these considerations it might be best to keep the 
inter-Party talks separate from any initiative which the Government may decide to take, whether in co-operation with Mr. Lynch or not. The Opposition have made this relatively easy for the Government by refusing to confine the talks to Privy Counsellors, since there can be no question, on this basis of discussing a Government initiative which would involve some delicate negotiations with both Mr. Lynch and Mr. Faulkner. 
But, 
even if, for this reason, the talks are little more than window-dressing and spinning out time, it will still be necessary to consider the questions of Chairmanship; Government representation; 
and representation of the 
Liberal Party. On these points the proposals in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the memorandum seem sensible. 
But, for the rest, the draft letter to the 
Leader of the Opposition may need some amendment in the light of the points above.

Detailed Elements of the proposed Reform The meeting on 20th January agreed to resume its discussion of the 
Home Secretary’s paper (GEN 47(72) 1) with a view to identifying questions which might be referred to officials for further analysis or action. The chief of such questions, with some notes on the present state of their examination, appear to be as follows:(a) The Border. Should this be the subject of a referendum? Should there be local plebiscites; and, if so, how large should the local units be? How would the question be posed? What legislative provision would be required? The formula adopted in the instructions to Parliamentary Counsel is that the 1949 Act provision 
- i. e. that only with the agreement of the Northern 
Ireland Parliament shall Northern Ireland or any part of it cease to be part of the United Kingdom - 
should be repealed 
and should be replaced by a provision that neither Northern Ireland nor any part thereof shall cease to be part of Her Majesty’s Dominions and of the United Kingdom unless a referendum (in the form prescribed in the Bill 
- the machinery 
should cause no trouble) establishes that a majority of the people of Northern Ireland support such a course. It would not be out of the question to hold a referendum related to part and not the whole of Northern Ireland. But the Republic is not likely to welcome such a course (which would reduce the proportion of Catholics in Northern Ireland and risk encumbering the Republic with unquiet areas); and the identification of areas suitable for local plebiscites would present difficulties. But the Home Secretary seems committed to the idea that the first plebiscite should not be held for 15 or 20 years. Would it be wrong, however, to inaugurate the reform with a plebiscite? 
(b) Transfer of Law and Order (i) What should this heading comprise? In GEN 47(71) 8 the Chairman of the Official Committee suggested the police, the Special Powers Acts, prosecutions, courts, prisons and internment camps and the probation and children’s ,services. It would thus involve all aspects of the internment policy, including decisions on the making of individual internment orders. There are other matters which might also have to

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 63 26 JANUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours Yesterday’s events displayed two features which have increasingly 
characterised the security scene since the a. 
nning of this week: 
a pattern of attacks on members of the RUC and its Reserve, usually by gunmen operating from cars; 
b. 
a pronounced concentration of terrorist activity in the south-east corner of the Province. 
Both these trends - if that is what they prove to be - are consistent 
with the aim which was reportedly agreed at the Provisional’s staff meeting at Cavan on 17 January (Report No 60, paragraph 9 refers), that the Active Service Units operating from the Republic should concentrate their attacks on local elements of the security forces, i.e. the RUC and UDR. The second trend is also consistent with the presence of Martin Meehan in Dundalk, where it is fairly clear that he has taken charge of the direction of operations (especially since the arrest in Northern Ireland of Sean Collins). 2.. 
The policeman (Sergeant Edward Kelly) who was machine-gunned 
outside his home at Newry yesterday morning remains very seriously i During the afternoon, in Belfast outside a cinema in Ormeau Road, tw constables of the RUC Reserve were shot and wounded, one of them. seriously. 3. 
in Londonderry. At a point on the border west of Keady, a mobile patrol came under fire from the other side of the border. There we no military casualties in any of these incidents. In Belfast a girl of sixteen was injured when a nail bomb was thrown at a military police vehicle in Springfield Road. 
Altogether there were six shooting incidents in Belfast and fiv

NORTHERN IRELAND : 25th JANUARY 1972 
CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO. 62 
Incidents in the past 24 hours Shooting incidents continue to dominate the security morning a policeman was shot and seriously wounded in Newr 
scence. Early this This followed 
three earlier attempts, all unsuccessful, to shoot members of the RUC, one of which was also in Newry and the other two in Belfast. The Newry attempt, and one of those in Belfast, were made from passing cars. 
2. In Lurgan, three masked gunmen forced their way into a house and machine- 
gunned a 19 year old youth, leaving him wounded. There is no obvious reason why this youth, a Protestant factory worker, should have been singled out as a victim. 
3. Altogether there were four shooting incidents in Belfast and another 
four in Londonderry; in one of the latter the fire was returned. Nail bombs were also thrown at the troops in both cities. A youth was tarred and feathered in the New Lodge area of Belfast. 
There were three explosions in Belfast, one of which - with the fire which ensured - caused extensive damage to several buildings in the centre 
4. 
of Belfast; one passer-by was injured by flying glass. There was one explosion in Londonderry. Near Crossmaglen a bomb comprising some 200 lbs of gelignite packed into two milk churns was found at the roadside; it had not been primed. 
5. At Warrenpoint an RUC Reservist (a Catholic) is missing after leaving his 
home early in the evening to report for duty; and an anonymous telephone call stated that he had been kidnapped.

NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING 0700 HRS 21 JANUARY 1972 
General 1. 
and there has been a further decrease in the number of explosive attacks. 
Terrorist activity has remained at a relatively low level During the period however there were a number of 
attacks against the Security Forces. and a policeman and a soldier were seriously injured. 
A civilian was murdered Five 
terrorists were killed or wounded and the high arrest rate of wanted men was maintained in operations, particularly within Belfast. 
Recent reports indicate that both factions of the 
IRA are having difficulty in finding members of the right calibre to assume officer appointments and in some areas of Belfast are losing the support of more moderate Catholics. 
2. 
internment marches and rallies in breach of the current ban, the Government announced an extension of the ban on marches for a further year. 
Whilst NICRA and other Republican organisations plan antiboth Unionist and Republican circles. 
The announcement received a hostile reception in The establishment of a 
second internment camp at Magilligan has been seized on by Republican leaders in the Londonderry area as a local issue to be exploited by rallies and protest meetings. 
The proposed march 
scheduled for last Sunday was postponed until 30 January 1972 but a protest is expected at Magilligan on 23 January. 
3. 1972. 
Propaganda 4. 
The hostile campaign against the Security Forces has been 
continued with new allegations of brutality during interrogation. They relate to persons taken to Girdwood and Holywood and the attacks are directed more at the Army rather than the RUC. 
The 
allegations have been made available to the media through two. Catholic priests, Fathers Murray and Faul and considerable publicity is Irish national newspapers has been obtained. The anti-internment themes have been continued within and outside Northern Ireland. The case of Moore at the Armagh District Court where the Chief Constable and the Ministry of Defence are being sued for damages is providing further .publicity for allgations of brutality. 
5 Airportable Brigade 5. 
More than half of the bomb incidents of the week have taken 
place in country and border areas. The most serious was the explosion of a booby-trap in a policeman’s car in Craigavon on 14 January 1972 in which the officer was seriously injured. It appears that the device was connected to the car during the night

21 January 1972 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 14 JANUARY 1972 
- 20 JANUARY 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
Further discussions have been held on the arrangements for talks between the 
parties at Westminster. In Northern Ireland the ban on parades has been extended for a year, but defiance is planned by ’Loyalist’ as well as civil rights organisations. 
PARADES 2. 
The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland announced on 18 January that the 
existing ban on parades would be extended for a further 12 months when it expires on 8 February. The decision had been taken, he said, in order to prevent people from exposing the security forces and themselves to unnecessary dangers, and to enable the security forces to concentrate on the effort against terrorists. The situation would be 
pt under review so that, if the situation permitted, a 
relaxation of the ban might be considered. 3. 
The ban has been opposed by Mr Paisley, Mr Craig and some Unionist MPs (who 
have complained in particular about the failure to consult "loyalist" organisations beforehand), as well as by the Social Democratic and Labour Party. 
A motion of censure on the Government for its decision has been signed by two members of the Unionist Party 
4. - Captain Mitchell and Mr Laird - as well as three 
members of the Democratic Unionists and Mr Craig. The motion is due to be debated on 25 January. 
The Loyalist Workers’ Association, led by William Hull, has declared its 
opposition to the ban and plans to march in defiance of it. So has the Civil Rights Association. Spokesmen for the Orange Order, and other Protestant organisations associated with traditional parades have expressed opposition to the decision. 
5. Anti-internment marches are being planned in spite of the ban, and one in 
Armagh for 22 January may be accompanied by a Protestant counter-demonstration. INTER-PARTY TALES 6. 
In December the Labour Party had announced that it would be seeking an 
assurance from the Government that any subject could be raised during the proposed inter-party talks. (See HONIP(71) 51 paragraph 5). On 14 January the Home Secretary replied to a letter from Mr Callaghan which had asked for this assurance confirming that any relevant topic could be raised, although those who joined in the talks would do so without prejudice to their known positions. The Home Secretary added that, since the opposition parties in Northern Ireland were maintaining their refusal to participate in talks,the next step might be for discussions between the Opposition and Government at Westminster to be renewed. On 19 January the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary met Mr Wilson to discuss the proposed talks.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 50 20 JANUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours There were no major incidents during the period. In Co. 
Fermanagh there were two instances of shots being fired across the border from the Republic: near Garrison, at a sapper working party and its 16/5 Lancers escort while an unapproved road was being cratered, and at Aghalane, at a bomb disposal officer and his escort. In Londonderry four shots were fired at the Blighs Lane Post and three nail bombs were thrown at troops in William Street. 2. 
Also in Londonderry there were two explosions, one of which 
started a fire and attracted a crowd of 200 which beame rowdy. In Belfast a bomb which two youths left in a suitcase at an electrical shop was defused by a bomb disposal officer; and another bomb planted in a loading bay at a chemical works in the Shankill Road area failed to detonate when its fuse burnt out. Both These bombs contained some 20 lbs of gelignite and in both oases petrol had been lodged alongside the bomb. Near Aughnacloy, on the border, a 30 lb bomb was found in a car and was defused. 3.

Northern Ireland 
Inter Party Talks You will wish to tell your colleagues about your meeting with 
Mr. Wilson (and perhaps about your discussion with the Irish Ambassador on Tuesday?). 
Depending on the outcome of your exchanges with 
Mr. Wilson, the Committee may need to devote a little time to considering the modalities of any inter-Party talks, including the composition of the delegations (? only Privy Counsellors); the agenda (? excluding reunification, at least so far as we and Stormont are concerned); and the Government’s role (? passively auditory or actively vocal). The Political Situation (GEN 47(72) 1) 2. 
The Committee may find it difficult to quarrel either with the 
Home Secretary’s assertion that only three courses of action are open to us or with his reasons for dismissing the first two of these in favour of the third, i. e. his own plan. They may also accept his definition (at the top of page 3) of the three elements which that plan must comprise. 
But, 
before examining those elements in detail, the Committee should consider the basic question of the relationship between the plan and direct rule, i.e. the question whether the plan has some hope of succeeding and so avoiding direct rule or whether it is almost bound to end in, if not actually to precipitate, direct rule itself. 3. 
The answer must depend, of course, on its acceptability to the two 
communities. As regards the Catholics the fact that the plan rejects reunification (at least until the first plebiscite about the Border is held in 15 or 20 years’ time) is bound to count against it. Moreover, even a guarantee (based on legislation at Westminister) of minority participation in government may not be a sufficient inducement without some corresponding assurance of equal participation in the subordinate levels of administration. On the other hand, acceptance of the plan would presumably ensure the end of internment; and, if the law and order function were simultaneously transferred to Westminister, the balance of advantage might - one cannot say more - appear to the Catholics to be worth accepting. As regards the Protestants, there can be no certainty that Mr. Faulkner could stomach the plan or that, if he fell, anybody could

to meet the Prime Minister in The Irish Ambassador called on the Prime Minister Brussels at 10.45 a.m. 
Ambassador to the European Communities. He hoped, however, that the meeting would not be announced in 
advance; the Prime Minister agreed to this. The Ambassador said that Mr Lynch had asked him 
to give the Prime Minister an up-to-date picture of the situation in Northern Ireland as he saw it, as a 
preparation for their meeting in Brussels. He did not think Mr. Inch would want to talk about EEC 
matters in Brussels. The Ambassador said that Mr. Lynch had been 
particularly concerned about two recent developments e new instructions to the Army (i.e. the Yellow Card)

NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 7 JANUARY 1972 
- 13 JANUARY 1972 Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL 1. 
There have been no significant political developments this week. In the 
Republic, the growing unemployment problem has diverted some attention from the North but there are indications that the Government is concerned about the need to strengthen security measures. A member of the RUC Reserve and a UDR Sergeant have been shot dead in Belfast. 
REPORT ON SECURITY AT CRUMLIN ROAD PRISON 
2. Mr Faulkner announced in the Northern Ireland Parliament on 11 January that Sir Charles Cunningham had submitted his report on security at Crumlin Road prison and that the report recommended the speedy completion of measures to improve physical security, including the provision of new fencing, additional lighting and more watchtowers. Action was in hand on these and on other recommendations for the provision of further physical security precautions. 
3. The report had also recommended that the number of categories of inmates 
held in the prison should be reduced, on which action was being taken, and that the proportion of experienced officers among the staff should be increased. This recommendation was under consideration. The report said that ultimately the only satisfactory answer would be to build a secure prison of modern design on a different site. This recommendation was receiving immediate and detailed study 
ARMS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND CABINET MINISTERS 4. 
It was reported on 12 January that Northern Ireland Cabinet Ministers had 
been issued with arms to protect themselves and their homes in the event of attack by gunmen. Opposition MPs were also being allowed to carry weapons if they requested them. The decision to allow Cabinet Ministers to carry arms was condemned by the Northern Ireland Labour Party. 
RUC RESERVE 5. 
It was announced on 11 January that, on the recommendation of the Police 
Authority, it had now been agreed that the authorised establishment of the Reserve should be increased from 1,500 to 2,500, and that provision should be made for full-time service by members of the Reserve in support of the regular force, on a short-term basis, to relieve the heavy burden placed on the regular force by station-protection duties. 
NEW INTERNMENT CAMP 6. 
The Ministry of Home Affairs announced on 7 January that a second internment 
camp would be opened at Magilligan in Co. Londonderry as a contingency move. The camp would be sited at a former Army barracks. Mr Faulkner dismissed reports 
that a third camp was to be opened elsewhere in the Province.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 55 JANUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours the afternoon - 
There was another murder of an off-duty member of the UDR during the fourth such murder since the beginning of 
December 1971. Sergeant Crawford, of 9 UDR (Co. Antrim) was driving his van through Newtownabey, north of Belfast, on his way home from work when another oar drew alongside and several shots were fired from it which hit Sergeant Crawford in the head and killed him instantly. A passenger who was with him in the van was uninjured. 2. 
There were eight shooting incidents in all: including three 
instances of shooting at the military in Belfast and three outbreaks of shooting in Londonderry. In one of the latter, which followed disturbanes in the William Street area during which the premises of a taxi Firm were set on fire, a gunman was wounded. There were five explosions, four in Belfast and one in Londonderry. 3. 
Two rifles, two shotguns and two revolvers were found in a 
hedge four miles west of Pomeroy. 4.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 5413 JANUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours There were only comparatively few incidents during the period, 
most of them to do with shooting. In Londonderry, early in the afternoon, a Service helicopter flying over a cemetary near Blighs Lane Post was shot at; subsequently soldiers saw some men carrying Thompson machineguns, fire was exchanged and it is believed that four of the gunmen were hit. Later, in the same area, the security forces fired at a gunman in Beechwood Street and his body was seen to be carried away. 2. 
Elsewhere, shots were fired during the day at patrols near 
Strabane, near Sion Mills and on the border at Belco. In none of these incidents were there any security force casualties. However, a police reservist, while at his work in a printer’s shop adjoining the Ballymurphy area, was attacked by three men with automatic weapons and was shot dead. 3. 
Warders searching the Crumlin Road Prison found two loaded 9 mm 
pistols in a cell. As they did so, the inmate shouted that "some of the weapons" had been found; but a further extensive search did not bring any more weapons to light. 4. 
There were 55 arrests of wanted persons during the period, and 
ten routine arrests. The former included William Hanaway, an officer on the brigade staff of the Brady IRA 
- who has already started to 
divulge information. Possible IRA campaign against RUC Reserve 5. 
It is possible that the murder of a member of the RUC Reserve 
(above) was timed to follow closely upon the Northern Ireland Government’s announcement on Tuesday that the target strength of the Reserve was being increased from 1500 to 2500, and that it heralds,

NOTE OF A MEETING WITH DR. O’CONNELL. I spent an hour and a quarter with Dr. O’Connell this morning. He 
began by saying that his objective was to meet the Home Secretary and he agreed to see me under the impression that our discussion would be only preliminary.

I explained that we certainly understood that he wanted to If the 
Home Secretary considered it appropriate to see Dr. O’Connell himself this might follow, but I could give no commitment. 
Dr. O’Connell was prepared 
to go ahead on this basis. He had had discussions with leaders of the I.R.A. and with Dr. Paisley. 
The proposal which had emerged from these discussions was that the I.R.A. would declare that they were calling off the campaign of violence on the understanding that after 30 days of peace, internment would be ended and a week thereafter talks would begin. at these talks. 
The I.R.A. wanted to be represented Dr. O’Connell suggested one from the Provisional and one 
from the Official I.R.A., though they need not appear at the table behind I.R.A. labels. 
Dr. O’Connell claimed that he had persuaded Paisley to 
accept their presence at the table; there was a precedent in Michael Collins’ discussions with Sir James Craig. There was a certain amount of obscurity as to what was to happen during Dr. O’Connell suggested that if the violence stopped, the 
I gained the impression that the the 30 days. troops could be withdrawn to barracks. 
I.R.A. envisaged the 30 days as a kind of truce in which the army would not take "offensive" action against them, and perhaps might even withdraw from the streets, whereas Dr. O’Connell emphasised that it would be a unilateral cessation of violence by the I.R.A. 
The public presentation of the agreement 
was also flexible; it was not necessary to announce on day 1 that internment would end in 30 days. 
It could be that the I.R.A. would publicly announce

WILLIAM JOHN MOORE -vR SHILLINGTON and This Civil Bill was heard on MINISTRY OF DEFENCE Wednesday the 19th day of January 1972 subsequent days the 20th, 24th, 26th, 27th and 28th day of that month. At the outset Mr McDermott QC for the Defendants, asked me for an adjournment 
since a case of similar nature in my Court had been made the subject of a motion to transfer to the High Court on the certificate dated the 10th day of January 1972 of the learned Attorney General under Section 20 of the Crown Proceedings Act l947. The Plaintiff therein as within the jurisdiction and, it was said, issues of discovery, privilege of documents and for witnesses would arise therein and I should await determination of that case. 
Mr McDermott also argued that an opinion of mine on the 3rd day of January 
1972, and Orders consequent thereon of the 14th day of January 1972 in the present case were under appeal, viz., one allowing the Plaintiff state his case on Affidavit, the other ordering Discovery of material for which privilege had been claimed, and that I should await determination of these since the Orders I had made affected the manner in which the trial should be conducted before me. 
Mr Nicholson, QC, for the Plaintiff, objected to any adjournment, argued that the appeals were made without jurisdiction, 
offered to forgo his existing right 
to discovery under my order, and to proffer the Plaintiff for examination and cross examination if the Defendants undertook that the Plaintiff would not be arrested during the trial. 
In reply, Mr McDermott indicated for the first time since November 1971 that, 
by reason of information available to the Security Forces since the 4th day of November 1971, they wished to interview the Plaintiff and that, if 
the jurisdiction, he would now be arrested under Regulation 10 of the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 for interrogation.

15 January 1972 
Dear Lord Parker, Thank you for your letter of 30 December 
about the approach you have received from Mr. Alex Lyon concerning your terms of reference. I am grateful to you for letting me see 
the letter. I do not think it would be right for me or any of my colleagues to reply to a letter which was addressed to you as Chairman of your Committee. 
You may feel therefore 
although this is of course entirely a matter for you - that it would be desirable to send Mr. Lyon some reply to his letter. 
I would 
think that you might be able to tell Mr. Lyon, if you were so minded, that, while you could

PRIME MINISTER After you had signed the letter to Lord Parker 
about the approach which he had had from Mr. Alex Lyon, M.P., departments had second thoughts. 
It was felt that it 
would be unwise for Lord Parker simply to ignore Mr. Lyon’s letter and that he should be encouraged to send some kind of positive-seeming reply. 
Otherwise there would be the 
danger that Mr. Lyon would jump to the conclusion that the Committee were not concerned in any way with the legal aspects of interrogation and would make this a Parliamentary issue with Ministers. 
On the other hand, we do not want 
Lord Parker to anticipate his Committee’s findings or to close options about the scope of their final report. Although they have been taking evidence about the legal aspects of interrogation, they may find it convenient to say 
little about this in their final report. I therefore attach a revised draft which has now been 
approved by all concerned and designed to avoid these various pitfalls. You may also be interested to see the attached 
record of a discussion which the Attorney General had with the Committee about the legal issues.

7th January, 1972 18/2/16 I accompanied the Attorney General yesterday morning 
on his visit to the Parker Committee. Lord Parker opened by saying that he had been told 
of the Attorney General’s difficulties over advising the Committee on the Human Rights aspect of the problem, now that a case before the European Commission was pending. He said that the Committee fully appreciated this and would not, therefore, wish to press him on that point. The Attorney General said that he was grateful. He could, however, tell them that H.M.G. would be strenuously resisting the allegations of the Irish Government. 
Mr. Boyd Carpenter asked whether it would be possible 
for the Attorney to speak about the Geneva Convention. The Attorney General said that it was the strong assertion of H.M.G. that Article 3 did not apply to the present situation in Northern Ireland. Lord Parker then mentioned that the general rules on interrogation issued by H.M.G. referred to Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. The Attorney General said that this was so but, of course, the rules were not originally designed for the Northern Ireland situation; and the Geneva Convention was taken as a guide line. He went on to say that he found himself in a similar difficulty in advising the Committee about the Geneva Convention, because any views he expressed on Article 3 might have a bearing on the Human Rights Convention also. He said that if the Committee wished to have any guidance on the Geneva Convention point the Foreign and Commonwealth Office might be prepared to submit a note. Lord barker commented that he thought the Foreign and Commonwealth office would be in the same difficulty as the Attorney. 
The Attorney then said that if the Committee were to 
deal with these international legal matters in their Report, a pronouncement could be very damaging to one side or the other in the pending case before the European Commission.

MINISTRY OF DEFENCE MO 19/3/6 6th January, 1972 Thank you for sending us a copy of your letter of 30th December 
to graham Angel about the letter from Mr. Alexander Lyon, M.P. to Lord Parker in which he raised the question of the Parker Committee’s terms of reference. I have also seen Stephen Boys Smith’s reply of 4th January. 
As I told you on the telephone we are not entirely content with 
the line which the Home Office draft suggests the Prime Minister should take. 
We agree with you that it is not for the Prime Minister to 
write to Mr. Lyon, as Lord Parker tentatively suggests. But on the other hand we do not think that Mr. Lyon’s letter should simply be ignored: to do so would surely aggravate a source of potential trouble. We therefore see no reason why the Prime Minister should not say in answer to Lord Parker that it would be perfectly in order for him, Lord Parker, to reply to Mr. Lyon that his Committee are considering, amongst other things, the legal aspects of the use of interrogation, but that clearly at this stage in their inquiry he cannot say more than that. There is no point in trying to conceal from Mr. Lyon the fact that the Committee are looking at the legal side of the problem. (One might indeed observe that it would be very odd if a Committee with this composition did not look at this aspect.) A number of legal bodies and individual lawyers have responded to the Committee’s public invitation and have made written representations to them, and some (e.g. Justice) have given oral evidence. 
I am sending copies of this letter to Angel (Home Office), 
Hetherington (Law Officers’ Department), Norbury (Cabinet Office) and to Sir Dick White. 
(R.A. CUSTIS) P.L. Gregson, Esq.
