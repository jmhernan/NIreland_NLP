LONG KESH III Ref As Meeting held by DS6 in Whitehall Buildings on 25 May 1971. 1. 
The completion dates for Long Kesh III were discussed with 62 CRE and CRE 
N Ireland at a meeting here on 26 May, and the following forecasts agreed. These are based on the assumption that the squadron will be able to be fully deployed on the task by 1 July 1971. 
a. Phase I Completed by 11 Sep 71. This allows 60 working 
days and is based on a 6 day week. b. 
Security for Phase I Will take 14 days to complete. This 
could run concurrently ith Phase I if a decision to implement Phase III is given early enough. 
c. d. 2. 
Phase II Completed by 13 Nov 71. Based on 6 day week. Will take 14 days to complete. 
Completion of Phase III 
This again could be concurrent with Phase II. Work should be completed by 30 Nov 71. 
Implementation of Phase III could cause difficulties with contractors, which 
would delay completion of Phases I and II. This is especially critical over the base laing and the EBNI contracts. Phase III should not therefore be implemented or announced earlier than necessary or without reference to the construction plan.

25 May 1971 1. Thank you for your letter of the 21 May about internment. You 
will probably by now have seen Lord Carrington’s minute to the Prime Minister. I have discussed the practical arrangements which need to be put in hand and I am pleased to say that work will begin on it

September for Phase 1 of the camp if it is required for internment i.e. an accommodation for around 150 people with the necessary security fencing, etc.

should have discussions about any further contingency planning which may be required. 
comments. We propose to make ad hoc arrangements during the course of construction to provide extra "boxes"; and, provided the number of internees is well below the 450 for which the camp will cater. there will be no problem in providing a separate hut for visitors. Should at any stage there be overcrowding in the camp, as Chambers has pointed out, there is space for an extra hut in the camp layout. But we would prefer not to go to that expense, unnecessarily, at the present time. 
In completing the plans we have taken into account Mr Chamber’s 4. You may think that the next steps will bet be for you to brief 
your successor and to suggest to him that he has a briefing session on internment at some early stage which could also be an opportunity for a general review of Home Office/Northern Ireland Government/ 
Ministry of Defence plans. D. A. NICHOLLS giving a likely completion date of end August/beginning

POSSIBLE INTERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND At your meeting at the end of last month to discuss 
Northern Ireland, it was agreed that the Home Secretary and I should have further discussions with the object of finding funds for the construction of a camp at Long Kesh which could be used to house internees if it were decided to bring in internment. 
2. It is clear that the Northern Ireland Government are 
precluded by practical difficulties from contributing to the project, at least at this stage; and the Home Office have no authority to finance such accommodation in Northern Ireland. I am a little hesitant about whether it is appropriate to finance it from Defence Votes but, given the importance of making a start on the camp as quickly as possible, I would not wish to spend further time on looking for other ways to fund it. 
3. I am therefore giving instructions that the necessary 
financial arrangements should be put in hand for the project to be paid for, at least initially., out of Defence Votes. I hope the work can begin by the end of the month.

Chambers, of our Prison Department, has queried the plan for the be plan shows only seven "boxes" for visitors 
to speak to internees through a partition. While he was in Northern Ireland with the reconnaissance party, Chambers pointed out that the number of such boxes should represent roughly 10 per cent of the total number of internees. We cannot be sure just how full the internment camp would be if it ever had to be used, but it would seem that provision will have to be made for 30 - 40 "boxes". 
Chambers would prefer to see visiting facilities provided in a 
separate but (at present they represent only one-third of the area of the reception centre) and there would appear to be room for an extra but in the camp layout. This of course means more cost. 
Two minor points which struck us were the descriptions of buildings 
11 and 7. Presumably these will be otherwise described at a later date and it was simply the planners’ intention not to confuse us at this stage. 
With regard to the provision of custodial staff, I am afraid that I 
can say no more than that the Northern Ireland Government have accepted the need to provide internal custodians and are considering ways in which they can provide the staff when the need arises. 
May we retain the plans for the camp? D. A. Nicholls Esq.

INTERNMENT CAMP - NORTHERN IRELAND 
US of S (Army) has seen the attached minute from AUS(GS);*he understands that the Secretary of State has so far been reluctant to agree that Defence Votes should bear the cost of providing accommodation for an Internment Camp in Northern Ireland even though we may be able to use it for other purposes appropriate to the Ministry of Defence. 
However, he feels that the arguments in AUS(GS)’s minute for accepting that the cost might fall, at least initially, on the Ministry of Defence are strong enough to justify going ahead with the project on this basis. 
In particular, he feels that the ability to use The Royal Engineers will make this a comparatively inexpensive undertaking and he recommends that the Secretary of State should write to the Prime Minister on the lines of the draft provided.

INTERNMENT CAMP - 1. NORTHERN IRELAND At a meeting to discuss Northern Ireland affairs under the 
Prime Minister’s Chairmanship on 27 April it was agreed that it would be wise to prepare suitable accommodation for an internment camp. 
It was noted that the Northern Ireland Government agreed 
with HMG in Westminster that a site at Long Kesh was the best choice for this purpose: and that it was desirable for an alternative use for the accommodation to be found. 
The meeting 
invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Defence, to seek, urgently, means of providing funds for the construction of such accommodation at Long Kesh (1). 
2. Ireland Government. 
The Home Office have had further discussions with the Northern Given that the real purpose of the accommoda- 
tion must not be divulged in public, the Northern Ireland Government have confirmed that they can see no way of overcoming two 
major difficulties: first, defence is a reserved subject under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and the financing by the Stormont Government of accommodation for troops would be unconstitutional: secondly, authority for expenditure of the order envisaged, or any attempt to get round the constitutional position, could not be concealed and would almost certainly lead to public debate in Stormont. 
At the same time, the Northern 
Ireland Government recognize our difficulties: they have given assurances that if internment were introduced, they would see what financial aid could be given and in any case would pay rent for the camp; they also recognize their responsibility to provide the custodians and domestic services required in the event of internment. 
3. The Home Office themselves have no authority to finance any 
prison accommodation outside Great Britain; and the Department of the Environment could not act as agents for them, or for any other body, without there being proper and legitimate authority so to do. 
4. Even if it appeared possible to find a way round these 
difficulties, it is clear that they could not be resolved speedily. We must therefore reconsider the grounds on which, at least initially, Defence votes could provide the funds for the camp.

INTERNMENT 1. 
We are still looking here at ways and means of getting financial 
authority to make a move on the internment camp, without prejudice to the possible assistance which the Northern Ireland Gvernment may be able to give later. 
2. In parallel we are seeking to complete the arrangements for 
the actual building of the camp. On this count I have now obtained the plans which the RE will be working to. They are substantially the same as those which I believe were shown to you at the meeting you held with Mr Stout, but it may be helpful for you to see them so that you can confirm that you have no further questions on the layout and construction as. such. Could you please ensure that your colleagues in the Prison Dept see the plan so that they may give us a similar confirmation. I should be very grateful if you could arrange this as soon as possible.

May, 1971 You wrote on 24th May asking on the Prime Minister’s 
behalf why the Army did not return fire in the shooting incident in the Falls Road on 18th May which was referred to in paragraph 2 of HO NIP(71)20. 
The Army land rover involved was driving up the Falls 
Road in the early evening when it was overtaken by a car just before a road junction. The rear window of the car had been removed, and two bursts of machine gun fire were aimed through the opening at the land rover 
- whose driver 
immediately swerved onto the pavement out of the line of fire. The car then turned off the main road and was lost. (It was found abandoned half an hour later.). The whole incident lasted only a matter of seconds and in this short time the gunmen presented no target for the crew of the land rover. 
Under the present state of alert in the Belfast area, vehicles are now travelling in pairs. Each vehicle of a 
pair is crewed by at least two men (including the driver), thus giving the occupants of the second vehicle a better chance of engaging any assailants.

PRIME MINISTER POSSIBLE INTERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND At your meeting at the end of last month to discuss 
Northern Ireland, it was agreed that the Home Secretary and I should have further discussions with the object of finding funds for the construction of a camp at Long Kesh which could be used to house internees if it were decided to bring in internment. 
2. It is clear that the Northern Ireland Government are 
precluded by practical difficulties from contributing to the project, at least at this stage; and the Home Office have no authority to finance such accommodation in Northern Ireland. I am a little hesitant about whether it is appropriate to finance it from Defence Votes but, given the importance of making a start on the camp as quickly as possible, I would not wish to spend further time on looking for other ways to fund it. 
3. I am therefore giving instructions that the necessary 
financial arrangements should be put in hand for the project to be paid for, at least initially, out of Defence Votes. I hope the work can begin by the end of the month. 
the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and to Sir Burke Trend. 
I am sending copies of this minute to the Home Secretary, 21st May 1971

HONIP(71) 20 21 May 1971 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 14 
- 20 MAY 1971 Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL SITUATION 1. 
There have been no major political development to report this 
week. Events during the week appear to show a shift in emphasis away from the use of explosives and incendiary devices, the number of which decreased, towards direct attacks on the security forces. It is, however, too soon to say how definite a trend this is. There was also evidence towards the end of the week of tension rising in Belfast, following the shooting and funeral of William Reid. Reasons for the disturbances on Thursday night are, at the time of writing, not entirely clear; nor is it certain how widespread is the feeling on the part of Roman Catholic groups that the military over-reacted to the situation, but there are suggestions of a serious deterioration in the relations between the military and the people in the New Lodge Road area. 
SECURITY 2. 
The week has witnessed continuing evidence of the known 
intention of the Brady group of the IRA to build up its attacks on members of the security forces. On 18 May, three men opened fire with a sub-machine gun through the open rear window of their car on an Army landrover in the Falls Road. No one was hurt, and there were no arrests. The military did not return the fire. Earlier, on 15 May, from a car that had been stopped for searching by military in a landrover, a man opened fire with a sub-machine gun. In the ensuing exchange of fire two soldiers were wounded, one seriously, and one of the occupants of the car, William Reid, killed. The Brady group later stated that Reid had been an officer in one of its units. The other two occupants escaped, one, it was thought, with a bullet wound. Extensive searches have been made by the security forces since the incident in order to find the two men who escaped, but so far without success. In an incident of rather different significance, an RUC landrover was stolen while its occupants were held at bay by gunmen in Garrison, a border town in County Fermanagh. 
3. Two other shooting incidents were reported during the week, one 
directed at an Army observation post in the Unity Flats area, the other not involving the security forces. In neither were the culprits apprehended.

20th May, 1971 Since I wrote to you on 18th May about 
the steps being taken by the Security Forces to deal with bomb explosions in Northern Ireland we have been notified of a small change in the plans. There are now to be three explosive detection teams (not two as stated in the fourth paragraph of my previous letter): one of these will operate in Belfast and two in the rural areas. 
I am sending copies of this letter to Johnny Graham and Brian Norbury as before.

It is not at all easy to counter either bomb explosions Both explosive and incendiary devices are easy to They are 
The matter has, 
however, been considered very recently by the Northern Ireland Joint Security Committee on the basis of a study undertaken for the Northern Ireland Government. 
This study concluded that only about 0.1% of the total 
amount of explosives used annually in Northern Ireland (approximately 3,000,000 lbs) is used illegally, and that there is no evidence of excessive storing in magazines and duly licensed quarry stores, or of any stealing from them. 
There 
is evidence, however, that the control of explosives on site in quarries, etc. tends to be lax. 
statute to a minimum of 12 hours’ notice, and is supervised by the police. 
All shot-firers have been vetted and steps are 
being taken to introduce statutory licensing for them. Magazines have to be approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs and there is a statutory obligation to return all unused explosive material to store. 
All the evidence indicates that the explosives used 
illegally come into Northern Ireland across the border or on cross-channel ferries. 
The emphasis is now to be on action to 
detect illicit supplies and saboteurs by spot checks on bulk imports, licensed stores and registered premises, points of entry and public works and contractors’ stores. 
The RUC is 
forming two explosive detection teams, one for Belfast and the other for the rural areas. 
One Army sabotage expert will be attached to each of these police P.L. Gregson, Esq. Their task will be normal detective

The Northern Ireland authorities 
are seeking advice from the Home Office about stricter control of internal movement of explosives.

You asked who would be opposing Mr. Athur 
Latham’s 10 Minute Rule Motion on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland on Wednesday. You commented that it requires a "moderate". This was apparently discussed at Legislation Committee last week. The Chief Whip agreed to Mr. Sharples’ suggestion that the opposer should be Mr. Deedes. He has already been laid on to do it and is in the process of being briefed by the Home Office. He does not quite answer to the specification you had in mind, but we cannot easily stand him down now. And, provided that he takes note of his Home Office briefing ,he ought to get the balance about right.

7 May, 1971 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 29 APRIL - 6 MAY 1971 
Memorandum by the Home office 
GENERAL SITUATION 1. 
It has been generally another quiet week on the streets in 
Northern Ireland and there is also little to report in the political field. The seriousness of the continuing incidence of explosions cannot be overlooked, however, particularly as there are signs that, as well as damaging property, they are designed to intimidate and show a callous disregard for human lives. Following Mr. Fitt’ s meeting with the Lord Chancellor, reported in paragraph 11 of last week’s HONIP, and the 25 priests’ census statements (last week’s HONIP paragraph 7) a group of 100 lawyers purporting to be from all sections of the community throughout Northern Ireland have called on the Northern Ireland Law Society and Bar Council to institute an enquiry into the administration of the criminal law in Northern Ireland. Their resolution made clear that this did not necessarily imply any fault in existing practice. 
2. The Northern Ireland Budget was presented at Stormont on 
4 May by Mr. Kirk, the Minister for Finance. Most press interest was elicited by the announcement that Northern Ireland would receive an extra £36 million from the United Kingdom Government for social services. 
3. In the Irish Republic, Mr. Boland announced his resignation 
from the ruling Fianna Fail Party on 2 May. There has also been much speculation in the Irish papers that a new Republican party, covering both sides of the border, was in the process of formation. It is unlikely, however, that such a party will be formed in the immediate future or that either this speculation or Mr. Boland’s resignation will provide the opportunity for further erosion of Mr. Lynch’s personal position. 
THE SECURITY SITUATION 4. 
The most notable feature of the week was the continuing 
number of explosions caused by charges placed outside public buildings, bars and private houses. On Sunday evening, almost

PRIME MINISTER NORTHERN IRELAND - BORDER STUDY As you know, GOC Northern Ireland was asked to submit by 
the end of April an interim report to cover any measures which he considered should be implemented at once to improve the security of the border. 
The GOC has reported that he has no firm proposals at present for immediate implementation. 
2. He is, however, pressing 
ahead with the studies and consultation necessary for the final comprehensive report which his terms of reference require him to render not later than 31st May. 
3. 
stage, it is quite clear - and of course directly relevant to any visit to London by Mr. Lynch 
the Ambassador in 
Although he does not come to any firm conclusions at this - that the major question to be 
decided is whether we would achieve more effective results through co-operation with the authorities South of the border, or through attempts to impose a higher degree of physical control. alternatives are very largely exclusive: 
These 
Dublin has advised that physical barriers would be strongly resented not only by the local communities but also by the Eire authorities and would therefore minimise the willingness of the latter to co-operate. 
4. The report brings out the ineffectiveness of previous 
attempts to impose a higher degree of physical control; lists many of the difficulties in doing so; and suggests that more effective measures of control within Northern Ireland might be more fruitful than a dissipation of effort all along the border. 
5. On a specific matter raised on Mr. Faulkner’s visit on 
1st April, it is not possible for the GOC at this stage to make firm recommendations for a change in the method of employment of the Ulster Defence Regiment. 
This must await the completion of 
his study. 6. 
The GOC is anxious to produce something more constructive 
than a list of difficulties, and I am sure that he is right to defer making firm recommendations until he has been able to make
