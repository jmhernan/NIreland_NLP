ASD2 FORCE LEVELS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
Background 1. In answer to questions it may be admitted that the force level in Northern Ireland is being reduced to that required before 1 Mar 73. 
Line to be taken Q.1. 
Is it true that some units are being withdrawn from Northern Ireland without relief? 
A.. Yes the additional units dispatched to Northern Ireland before the border referendum are returning to their peace tie locations within the next few days. 
(2RRF are returning to Catterick 1 A & SH are returning to Kirknewton) 
Q.2. A.2. 
Why has this decision been taken? 
The extra units were only sent to Northern Ireland as a precautionary measure in the case of trouble arising during the border referendum and the publication of the White Paper. 
Q.3. Have other units who were put at notice for the publication of the White Paper been stood down? 
3. 
There has been a relaxation of the degree of notice. (It is not MOD policy to disclose the details) 
Q.4 What will the overall strength of troops in Northern Ireland after the departure of the two units? 
A.4. 16,500 (18 major units in the inf role).

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION CGS/GOC NORTHERN IRELAND - 26TH MARCH 1973 The purpose of the telephone call was to discuss the relaxation 
1. 
of degrees of notice for those units stood by for the White Paper. It was agreed that with immediate effect all concerned should be released their normal degrees of notice and that reinforcement of Northern Ireland should be back to a Spearhead basis forthwith. The two battalions sent over for the Plebiscite should be returned to the UK tomorrow, 27th March. 
2. 
The GOC went on to discuss the following other matters: a. 
Mr Paisley’s Rally. Mr Paisley had rung the GOC on 
Friday night to ask if he could still hold the rally now that Captain Orr was not attending. The GOC had given the go-ahead on condition that no one was in uniform and no one was armed, even with cudgels. As it turned out, the meeting was a busted flush; half the 1750 attending were members of tartan gangs. 
b. The Border. There had been a generally quiet weekend 
with a slight increase in border activity, on both sides. This was as forecast but one item of interest had been the greatly increased cooperation of the Gardai. 
c. The Murders. The whole affair had been thoroughly 
unfortunate as although the soldiers had originally been in a pub that was in bounds, the murders took place in an area which was out of bounds at night. However, the murders could not have taken place at a worse time as far as the 
- 
opposition were concernedas public revulsion had acted against them at a time when they were looking for support for fairly unpopular views about the White Paper. It had been encouraging that the RUC were pulling out every stop to arrest those responsible. 
3. Turning to the future: a. 
The RUC. The GOC had discussed a paper on the future 
of the RUC with S of S NI, who was entirely in favour of the proposal to increase the number of RMP, as he had agreed

OP FLAXEN - RELAXATION OF NOTICE Reference: A. 1. 
a. Group A. A/120/GEN/6103 (ASD 2a) dated 14 Mar 73. If after the weekend the operational situation in 
Ulster permits a relaxation of notice, I confirm that we would wish to see: 
i.e. the two UKLF battalions (3RGJ and 1 STAFFORDS), relaxed to 72 hours notice. 
b. The balance. i.e. groups B - E, stood down to the normal 7 days notice, but if necesary still earmarked. 
2. However, if the GOC presses for a continuation of the 
stand-by arrangements I would recommend that at least the 4 BAOR battalions (group C) are released to 72 hours, thereby conforming with 40 Cdo RM at 72 hours from 220600Z). 
This 
relaxation will enable the RAF to re-activate their air movement programmee including possibly Exercise FAGAN (junior guardsmen to Kenya). 
3. Finally, I believe we should seek to recover the two 
(19th and 20th) battalions deployed for the Plebiscite. In outline their case histories are:

OP FLAXEN - HMS BULWARK AND 40 CD0 RM 1. 
GOC Northern Ireland confirmed yesterday afternoon that 
he was not expecting to ask immediately for any reinforcements to cover the publication of the White Paper, in view of the temporary lull in operational activity in Ulster. 
2. 
Bulwark, with 40 Cdo RM on board, direct to Belfast so that the Commando could disembark on about 22 Mar. 
You will recall that we had considered diverting HMS of GOC Northern Ireland’s assessment, this is no longer In the light 
necessary and I have arranged with the Navy Department that Bulwark should sail for Devonport as planned. 3. 
from 0600Z hours on 22 Mar. to move the Commando to Ulster. 
40 Cdo will then be held at 72 hours notice with effect It would take a further 24 hours

MO 19/3/1 
PRIME MINISTER You have already been informed of the precautionary measures 
being set in hand in connection with the Northern Ireland Plebiscite and the publication of the White Paper. Two additional battalions were deployed to Northern Ireland on 3/4 March to cover the Plebiscite period, as planned. 
2. I have been giving further thought to the arrangements for the 
deployment of units, should this prove necessary, following publication of the White Paper, and in particular the extent to which you and my Ministerial colleagues need to be kept in touch with developments. As you already know, two units will automatically be put at 24-hours notice on publication day, and a further six at 72-hours notice. As time will be very short, I have agreed that if the GOC, with the support of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, calls for the first two units they may be despatched without prior reference to myself; I shall of course inform you as soon as possible once this step is taken. Should the situation deteriorate to such as extent as to require the deployment of the additional six units, the matter will be referred to Ministers before any decision is taken. 
3. 
I am copying this minute to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Attorney General, 
--the Lord President of the Council, the Chief Whip and Sir Burke Trend. 8th March, 1973

Secretary of State OPERATION FLAXEN Reference: VCGS/1180/1 dated 22nd February 1973. 1. 
You will remember agreeing to our proposed arrangements for 
deploying and warning units over the period of the Plebiscite and White Paper (Op FLAXEN). 
2. I would now like to clarify the arrangements for the actual 
deployment of troops should this prove necessary. I suggest: a. 
Units should be brought to notice in relation to 
P Day (when it is announced) without any further reference to Ministers. 
b. I should have the authority to despatch the units 
on 24 hours notice when they are called for, by the GOC with the support of S of S NI, keeping you informed. 
c. d. 3. The despatch of the larger part of the reinforcements 
(72 hours notice) including four units from BAOR should be referred to you, and in all probability to Gen 79. 
Individual reinforcements should be brought to notice 
in relation to P Day and subsequently despatched with my authority. 
If you agree to these arrangements I will tell all concerned once P Day is announced. March 1973

I am directed to refer to Ministry of Defence letters A/20/GEN/7559 (ASD 2a) dated 28 February 1972 on the strength of 
infantry battalions and A/20/GEN/7559 (ASD 2a) dated 21 February 1972 which promulgated the changes to manning categories. 2. 
I am to say that the manning position in the Infantry between 
1 April 1973 and 31 March 1974 although improving will continue to be such that battalions in many cases will be unable to attain their authorised establishments during the period. 
There is, therefore, 
a continuing need to lay down a minimum manning strength in infantry soldiers for each battalion. 
3. 
The authorised establishment and minimum manning strengths for infantry battalions in 1973/1974 are tabulated at Annex A; all fi gures 
refer to infantry soldiers only, and do not include officers, bandsmen or attached personnel. 
Exceptions to the minimum manning strengths 
for the battalions of the Parachute Regiment are no longer authorised, and the battalion finding the British Honduras garrison is changed to Category 2. 
I am to add that detailed instructions for the implementation of the infantry manning plan are being issued separately by the Director of Manning (Army). 
4. Separate instructions are also being issued for personnel attached from other Corps. 5. 
Ministry of Defence letter A/20/GEN/7559 (ASD 2a) dated 28 February 1972 is to be cancelled with effect from 1 April 1973. 
I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,

CHANGES IN UNITS SERVING IN NORTHERN IRELAND Background 1. 
a classified signal today that they will relieve 2nd Ba Grenadier Guards in Northern Ireland during aid March. They will be moving from Kirknewton in Scotland. Although unit reliefs normally receive only nominal publicity, it is possible that questions about this particular one will be asked because the length of tour for the 2nd Bn Grenadier Guards will have been very short: the battalion has just moved to Northern Ireland to be available for the plebiscite. 
lst Bn The Argyl and Sutherland Highlanders are being told in 2. Copies of this defensive brief are being sent to CPRO’s in HQ NI 
and HQLF. Line to be taker 
Ql Why will 2 Gren Gds be relieved after such a short period (2 wks)? Al Because they have to be available for public duties at Windsor, when the President of Mexico visits early next month. 
Q2 Why did they move to Northern Ireland if such a short tine was envisaged? 
A2 When the plans for providing two extra battalions for the period of the plebiscite were made 2 Gren Gds were the next unit for duty. Additionally this battalion has only served once in Northern Ireland previously (Aug 69 - Jan 70) and every effort is made by the planning staffs to spread the evenly amongst all units. 
commitment Northern Ireland 
Q3 How long will 1 A & SH remain in Northern Ireland? A3 The time will be dependent on the operational situation, but in principle as short as possible. 
Q4 Will the rifle coy of 1 A & SH which is serving with 2 Gren Gds in Northern Ireland stay there on relief? 
A4 Yes. Does this mean that there will be an additional unit in Northern Ireland? 
A5 No, the total number of units in the Infantry role remains at 20 (overall strength remains At 17,500). 
Q6 How many times have 1 A & SH served previously in N. Ireland A6 Once, from June 72 until Nov 72.

March 1973 FORECAST OF EVENTS. - WEEKEND 9 - 12 MARCH 1973 
OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1. 
The main event of the week was the Border Plebiscite on 8 March. Although 
the Provisional IRA attempted to disrupt polling with a series of bomb and shooting attacks on polling stations, they did not succeed in their aim and voting went as expected. In Belfast there were six explosions against soft targets and four shooting attacks against polling stations in one of which a soldier died. In Londonderry there were five explosions against soft targets and in the rural areas one shooting attack at the Bessbrook (near Newry) polling station. Apart from these there was fairly widespread hooliganism. Voting went as expected: there was a high turnout by Protestants and a low one in Republican areas. 
2. Sniping continues particularly in Belfast where two soldiers were shot 
dead by snipers. Lollipop patrols continue to be targets. There have been some serious arms thefts. Last weekend in Armagh 8 weapons and 1500 rounds were stolen from an arms dealer and on 7 March 10 SLR’s and full magazines were stolen from UDR guarding polling stations in 2 separate incidents. 2 GREN GDS and 2 RRF deployed to the Province for the period of the Plebiscite bringing the force level to 20 major units in the infantry role.

There were 41 shooting incidents of which 28 involved SF (Belfast 33/22, 2. The Border Plebiscite and,the SF precautions covering it went according to 
plan. Provisional IRA emphasis was obviously on a major’bombing campaign and it would appear that they chose soft targets rather than polling stations because of the precautions taken by SF to protect the latter. In Belfast there were 4 shooting attacks on polling stations in one of which Pte GREEN, 1 QLR was killed. Elsewhere incidents directly relating to the poll were generally restricted to the stoning of polling stations. One shot was fired at a sentry on the polling station at Bessbrook.

Prime Minister 
Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary 
Sir Burke Trend Mr. R.T. Armstrong Mr. C.W. Roberts 
Mr. Liam Cosgrave, TD Mr. Brendan Corish, TD 
Mr. Hugh McCann 
H.E. The Ambassador of the Republic of Ireland 
Mr. Cosgrave opened with a sympathetic enquiry about the bomb 
explosions which had taken place in London earlier in the afternoon. The Prime Minister described the situation as it was then known, adding that there was as yet no firm information on who was responsible. The Prime Minister said that he was delighted to welcome Mr. Cosgrave and Mr. Corish to London. 
Discussions before the 
publication of the White Paper had originally been proposed by Mr. Lynch, but had been postponed because of the elections in the Republic. 
He was glad that it had been possible to arrange a 
meeting so quickly after the elections. His discussions with the Taoiseach were, of course, discussions between heads of sovereign Gvernments. 
What happened in Northern 
Ireland was the responsibility of the sovereign Government of the United Kingdom and of the Westminster Parliament. 
But the 
Government of the Republic also had a clear interest in events in the North, and it was right that the two Governments should discuss them together. 
Both he and Mr. Lynch had been able to make good 
progress through frank and confidential talks, the content of which was not disclosed to Parliament and the press. 
Mr. Cosgrave said that he was happy to proceed on this basis, and on the understanding

Annex A to A/BR/30/3/1/M04 Dated 
March 1973 INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY AS AT 28 FEBRUARY 1973 
PROVISIONAL IRA 1. 
There has been further confirmation of the discussion between Northern and 
Southern Divisional leaders. Consideration is being given by Northern leaders to ’going it alone’ as they feel that both finances and lines of supply are sufficient for this to be done. They are still agreed on the need to intensify their campaign of violence when the White Paper is issued to mark their rejection of it. Trouble is expected from Protestants at this critical time and plans Are reported to have been drawn up to strengthen Provisional units in Catholic areas for ’protection duties’ and to augment ASUs in border areas. 
It is 
reported that at a meeting of Provisional leaders in MONAGHAN on 11 February it was decided that all trained volunteers in Northern Ireland should be put on active service before details of the White Paper were announced. Provisional leaders have expressed no great interest in the outcome of the Border Poll on 8 March but isolated attempts to disrupt its operation and todissuade Catholics from voting must be expected. 
OFFICIAL IRA 2. 
The Official IRA have been involved throughout the month in contesting the 
Southern Irish General Election and in broadening their base of political activities in the North. In particular they are reported to have succeeded in widening their influence in NICRA. It is their stated policy to urge the boycott of the Border Poll and to picket polling stations. In general the Official IRA leaders believe that the White Paper will be unacceptable to militant loyalists, which could result in a Protestant backlash, which will in turn threaten the Catholic enclaves. Because of these fears, and also concern about recent intersectarian violence, the DUBLIN official leadership have reportedly authorised arms in the North to be taken out of storage in Catholic areas in readiness. These arms are only to be used in the event of Protestant attacks and the Officials do not contemplate using them against the security forces, thus breaking the ceasefire. There hive been reports of joint Provisional/Official and CESA patrols operating in BELFAST. 
PROTESTANTS 3. 
In the aftermath of the rioting of the 7 February Protestant militant 
activity has been confined to isolated incidents of murder, bombing and intimidation. Political activity has centred on CRAIG’s attempts to rehabilitate himself as a credible politician and on the attempts of the United Loyalist Council (ULC) to form themselves into a political party. Although Protestant para-military organisations continue to prepare themselves for militant action there is no intelligence to show whether they have any coordinated plans of action should they think the White Paper unacceptable to them. Protestant activity at the Border Poll on 8 March will be concentrated on obtaining the maximum turn out of voters and it is unlikely that they will initiate any violence at this time.

Annex B to A/BR/30/3/1/M04 Dated 
March 1973 
GENERAL 1. 
The major activity during the month has been in Belfast. In the rural areas 
the level of activity has generally been similar to recent months and Londonderry has been relatively quiet. In Belfast there had been a progressive decline in the level of violence since Christmas until 28 January when the Provisional IRA made a concerted, but unsuccessful, attempt to kill soldiers. This was the start of a period of violence which included sectarian murders, gunbattles and shooting incidents. In East Belfast Protestant extremists were particularly active and incidents included rioting and shooting at members of the Security Forces. This led, on 5 February, to the serving of Interim Custody Orders on Protestants for the first time. Protestant extremists leaders used this as an excuse to call a general strike for 7 February. The strike was well supported in Belfast but elsewhere stoppage of work was due primarily to lack of electric power. In Belfast it was a day of violence by both Protestant and Republican extremists particularly in East Belfast where the most significant incident was the ransacking of a RC church and priest’s house in Willowfield. The Protestant mob, several hundred strong, was eventually dispersed using 45 gr PVC baton rounds ( the only time they have been used). This day of violence led to wide condemnation of Protestant extremist leaders, brought into question the political credibility of William Craig , and produced a general feeling of embarrassment amongst moderate Protestants. A period of ’uneasy calm’ followed during which both Protestant and Republican extremists were relatively inactive. The Protestants have remained subdued and have particularly avoided further confrontation with the Security Forces. The Provisional IRA however have initiated a number of gunbattles particularly in the Ardoyne, New Lodge and Lower Falls areas. 
In 
addition there have been sniper attacks and planned ambushes of Security Forces. Murders without any apparent motive have continued though they have been less frequent and there has been a signifcant increase in incidents of intimidation particularly of isolated Protestants and Catholics in areas dominated by the other. 
2. The main feature of the month has been the Security Forces’ success against 
the terrorists and particularly against the Provisional IRA in Belfast. Eleven terrorists have been killed and 30 other hits have been reported. In addition at least 139 Provisional IRA (including at least 48 officers) and at least 50 Protestant extremists have been arrested. During the month 68 IRA and 51 Protestant firearms were discovered. Another setback for the Provisionals was on 10 February when 2 bombers blew themselves up near Strangford. 
It is estimated that at least 
59 IRA terrorists have killed themselves since thepresent campaign started. Another significant feature of the month has been the increasing number of IRA punishment shootings (generally in the leg) which is considered to be a definite sign of falling morale. 
3. During February 7 regular soldiers were killed and 32 wounded. An eighth 
soldier died of wounds sustained in October 1972. The most common form of attack against Security Forces has again been shooting but command detonated bombs have also featured. Although a high proportion of the number of rounds fired at Security Forces have been in gunbattles, no deaths and few casualties have been sustained in such operations. The majority of serious casualties have been in ambushes and sniper attacks,the latter being particularly dangerous against static soldiers in the open (for examples when on ’lollipop’ patrol or guarding RE working parties). A particularly unpleasant method of attack has been the small bomb in a doorway, one of which injured a soldier on ’lollipop’ patrol in the Crumlin Road and another a marine on a foot patrol at night.

TRAINING MATTERS NEGLIGENT DISCHARGES 1. 
There were 17 negligent discharges in the theatre during the period 
29 January to 27 February, of these 2 caused casualties. 2. 
SHOOTING STANDARDS 3. 
Further details including a summary are at Appendix 1. The number of rounds fired to hits claimed has increased slightly during 
the last two months. One factor which may have contributed to this is the involvement of SF in prolonged gun battles on numerous occasions during the period. 
4. Details, and the overall ratio of shots 
are at Appendix 2. PVC BATON ROUNDS 5. 
to hits since Operation MOTORMAN, The PVC baton round was used operationally for the first time in February. 
It is essential that units carry out sufficient training with the PVC round as well as the rubber baton round during pre tour training prior to arrival in Northern Ireland. 
6. Units should again be reminded that tampering with the baton for training 
purposes is forbidden. The training required is for at least 3 men per Sqn/Coy to be trained in firing the live round. Rounds are not to be fired with the baton removed or the charge reduced to add realism during urban riot training. The requirement for a blank round is realised and provision is being investigated. 
SNIPER COURSES 7. 
The first of the Northern Ireland sniper courses is expected to begin on 
29 April 1973. It is intended to run eight courses of 2 week duration covering both the rural and urban aspects of sniping in Northern Ireland. Capacity for each course will be 36 students with a minimum allocation of 4 vacancies per Infantry Unit and 3 per other arm unit in the Infantry role. 
SEARCH AND SNIFFER TEAMS 8. 
A requirement for most units in Northern Ireland to operate 6 rather than 
4 Search Teams is currently under examination. In order to overcome the problems of providing men for 6 Search Teams and 3 Sniffer Teams (3 Sgts, 6 Sgts/Cpls and 36 soldiers) it is proposed that all Search Teams should be trained in sniffer as well as search techniques. This would reduce the members requiring training to 6 Sgts/Cp1s and 30 soldiers. This proposal is also receiving consideration. 
POST TOUR REPORTING 
10. The present post-tour reporting procedure for roulement units serving tours in Northern Ireland is not entirely satisfactory. Reports are called for by differing HQs and vary in distribution, content and style.

TERRORIST BOMBING ACTIVITY FEBRUARY 1973 FINDS 1. 
March 1973 70 detonators were found by a routine patrol searching a derelict house. 
They were found inside a plastic container. 2. 
2 men stopped at a VCP were found to be in possession of weapons and 
detonators. After questioning, the men were persuaded to led the SF to a pigsty which contained a further 3 dets, 8 lb of commercial explosive and 1500 ft of Cordtex. 
3. SF search on information for a rifle thought to be in a particular area 
found a box under a gorse bush. It contained 155 lb of commercial explosive. 4. 
TECHNIQUES 5. 
6. Summary. In two cases an initial discovery or receipt of information led 
to further finds. This emphasises the need to follow up all possible leads and opportunities to obtain further information. 
Bombs are still being laid inside buildings. On the whole the explosive 
is positioned overtly by armed terrorists threatening the occupants. Holdalls and shopping bags are the more usual containers. 
In the majority of attacks against Catholic owned property, however, 
bombs are placed outside the building and are normally put in heavy cased containers such as beer kegs. Bombs are normally of about 20-50 lb in size, but larger bombs have been encountered. In general the bombs used against Catholic owned property have been larger than those used against Protestant owned property. 
7. 8. Towards the latter part of the month there was a marked increase in booby 
trappings, and the mining of roads and tracks against both vehicles and Personnel. 
In three oases where cars were booby trapped the initiating device appeared 
to be linked to the car door. The booby trapping of Army Eqpt has also occurred and finds of explosives 
have also been booby trapped. 10. The booby trapping of a petrol tanker was also a new innovation. 
11. An electrically initiated mine exploded in front of an SF landrover. On investigation the battery used was itself found to be booby-traped. 
12 Summary. The bombing of civilian premises continues. Devices put inside buildings are generally placed overtly. Booby trapping has increased and the more unusual aspects of this include the placing of a bomb on a petrol tanker and the booby trapping of stolen military equipment. 
EXPLOSIVES 
13. Of the devices neutralised this month, 1/6 of the total contained commercial explosive, the remainder were home-made.

Annex A to A/BR/30/1/M04 Dated 7 March 1973 
HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING 7 MARCH 1973 GENERAL 1. 
The general level of violence throughout the Province this week has bee similar 
to that of the previous two weeks. Four soldiers, one of whom was in the UDR, have been killed, one soldier has died from wounds received last month, and 11 Soldiers and one member of the RUC have been wounded or injured. Four civilians have been murdered. The SF have been involved in 105 of the 182 shooting incidents compared with 73 of the 111 last week. There have been 15 bomb explosions compared with 17 and 2 rocket attacks compared with one last week. 
2. A soldier was killed and another was wounded in 2 separate incidents when IRA 
gunmen fired at ’lollipop’ patrols in the Crumlin Road. These patrols exist in order to protect both Catholic and Protestant children who have to walk along the Crumlin Road interface on their way to and from 4 different schools. Each patrol requires a minimum of 120 soldiers and deploys 4 times daily because the children travel to school in the morning, home for lunch, back to school and home again in the evening. By the very nature of their duties the ’lollipop’ patrols are regularly on the Crumlin Road at fixed times and they are therefore vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Efforts to make alternative arrangements continue and on Monday agreement in principle was given to providing free buses to take children to and from school. This will reduce the number of children on the streets at any one time. 
3. After 3 shooting incidents in the Lower Falls on Sunday, in one of which a soldier 
was slightly wounded, an SF patrol carried out a hot-pursuit search of a house in which a gunman had been seen. A crowd of about 30 hostile women gathered in the area. Because the crowd were becoming increasingly hostile, the patrol commander decided to withdraw from the area as soon as the house had been searched. The women harassed and seriously obstructed the soldiers as they entered their armoured vehicle. A quick check was made and as it was thought that all the patrol were present the vehicle drove back to the SF base. It subsequently transpired that some of the women had separated one soldier from his colleagues. Within 10 minutes the SF were back at the scene but, by this time, the soldier had been shot twice and his rifle and ammunition had been stolen. He died later that night. Every effort is being made to arrest a Provisional who is thought to have been the assassin. 
4. Three other members of the SF have died during the week. A Staff Sergeant the 
UDR was abducted in his car, murdered and his body left beside the road in the Enclave near Londonderry on Saturday. When his burnt-out car was found by the SF near the Border there was an exchange of fire between gunmen and the SF who reported one hit. On Monday a soldier died of wounds received during the disturbances in East Belfast on 7 February 1973. He is the second soldier to have died as the result of violence by extreme Protestants. A soldier on foot patrol in the Ballymurphy area was killed by a sniper on Tuesday. 
5. The murders of 4 civilians, 3 Catholics and one Protestant, all took place it 
Belfast. Although one Catholic may have been murdered by the IRA as a punishment, the other 3 crimes appear to have been sectarian. In one of these, a Catholic bus driver was shot on Friday in the Woodvale Road by 2 armed youths who boarded the bus at a bus stop, killed the driver, wounded his relief and then drove away in a car. The youths are believed to be in the UVF. The drivers of the Belfast Corporation buses subsequently stopped work for 4 days as a protest against the murder of their colleagu Later the same day the IRA retaliated by murdering the secretary of an Orange Lodge in Ligoniel.

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MR COSGRAVE SHOULD HAVE ISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, DUT THINKS THAT MR COSGRAVE SHOULD DO SO ON HIS OWN. MR COSGRAVE IS KEEN TO MEET THE PRIME MINISTER, BUT SAYS THAT 12 MARCH WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM, AS THAT IS THE DATE WhEN THE PRESSURES OF FORMING HIS CABINET WILL BE AT THEIR HEAVIEST. 
3. MR COSGRAVE ASKED WHETHER IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER TO SEE HIM ON THURSDAY, 8 MARCH. AT MY SUGGESTION (AND MAKING CLEAR THIS WAS PURELY PERSONAL QUESTION ON MY PART) THE QUESTION WAS PUT TO MR COSGRAVE VIA MR LYNCH WHETHER FRIDAY, 9 MARCH, WOULD BE POSSIBILITY FOR HIM, IF THIS WOULD SUIT PRIME MINISTER. MR COSGRAVE HAS CONFIRMED THAT FRIDAY WOULD SUIT HIM. 
4. I ASKED WHETHER, ASSUMING 12 MARCH WERE THE ONLY POSSIBLE DATE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER’S POINT OF VIEW, MR COSGRAVE COULD MANAGE IT DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES. MCCAN SAID HE DID NOT BELIEVE. THAT 12 MARCH WAS COMPLETELY RULED OUT, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT.

NORTHERN IRELAND FORECAST OF EVENTS 
OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1. 
- WEEKEND 2 - 5 MARCH 1973 The major activity of the week has again been in Belfast. 
Londonderry has remained relatively quiet and the level of violence in the Rural areas has been similar to recent weeks. During the week there has been ambush and sniper attacks on SF. A soldier was killed by a sniper while on ’lollipop’ petrol in Crumlin Rd and a RUC constable was killed in an ambush at Cranagh Bridge (North of Lurgan). Two children have been killed: on Sunday in Londonderry Gordon Gallaghen (10-RC) was killed in the Creggan, Londonderry, when a claymore device exploded and on Tuesday in Newry SF returned fire and killed Kevin Heatly (13-RC). The latter incident in particular has been made the subject of an IRA propaganda campaign. The most significant aspect of the week however has been the continued success of the SF against the Provisional IRA. A 
large number of officers and volunteers have been arrested including, in a raid on a drinking club in the Ardoyne on Thursday, 8 members of 3 Bn Provisional IRA including the Explosives Officer.

rioting in the area. FORECAST OF EVENTS 2.

Ireland The Prime Minister said that he was not sure what 
would happen next in the Republic; it was a long time since Mr. Cosgrave’s party had been in power. The British Government had succeeded in making quite a lot of progress with Mr. Lynch. The number of explosions and shootings in Ulster had been considerably reduced. 
The future programme included the 
plebiscite on 8 March, which would reassure the Protestants; and the local government elections, which would help the Catholic elements 
- indeed Londonderry would probably 
be controlled by Catholics, and Mr. Heath was not sure what the consequences would be. The immediate task was to complete work on a new constitution for Northern Ireland, on which we had been engaged on consultations with Mr. Lynch. If this had gone according to plan, we could have made a big step forward. The time factor had to be reckoned with, as the constitutional plans had to be published this month, and urgent work with the new Irish Prime Minister was now required.

Framework for a Settlement for Northern Ireland (CP(73) 27) 
Perhaps the simplest way of presenting these proposals to those 
members of the Cabinet who have not been involved in the detailed discussions in GEN 79 is to remind them that direct rule cannot last indefinitely but must be succeeded by some form of political solution; that there are very obvious and powerful objections to the two extreme forms of such a solution 
- i.e. 
complete integration and total severance; and that, if these two approaches are ruled out, there remains only some kind of local Parliamentary democracy, with relative independence in some areas of policy and administration and much less in others. 
If so, however, the basic points which the Secretary of State emphasises in his covering memorandum - the 
need to govern by consent; the value of a flexible and evolutionary approach; the relevance of the "Irish Dimension"; and the critical importance of preserving bipartisan support at Westminster for the Government’s proposalsrepresent the essential parameters within which, as the Secretary of State sees it, the final solution must be found. 2. 
The Cabinet might begin, therefore, by considering whether they 
endorse these points and, in particular, whether they agree that the evolutionary approach which the Secretary of State commends is to be preferred to a more clear-cut solution, which would have to be imposed and, if it were rejected, would therefore leave us with no alternative to a further period of direct rule in conditions of tension which the failure of our initiative would itself have aggravated. By contrast the Secretary of State’s proposals at least allow us to regulate both the pace and the direction of constitutional development; and the Cabinet may feel that this argues in their favour. 3. 
Discussion can then turn to the specific items in the Annex to the Secretary of State’s memorandum.

his talk on the telephone with Mr. Whitelaw. If you were to speak you would open on the first day; there would be no wind-up speeches on that day; Mr. Whitelaw would open on the second day and a junior Northern Ireland Minister would wind. 
If you do not speak, 
Mr. Whitelaw will open on the first day, with two junior Northern Ireland Ministers on the second day. 
The Chief Whip had the impression 
that Mr. Whitelaw had a slight preference for the latter arrangement but would quite understand if you saw it as an opportunity for a major speech.

STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND 
TUESDAY 20 MARCH 1973 
Mr. Speaker, I will, with permission, make a statement. The Government has today published a White Paper setting out Constitutional Proposals for Northern Ireland. 
I will not today take the House through our proposals in detail especially as I understand that my rt hon Friend, the Leader of the House agrees that there should be an opportunity for an early debate. 
The Government proposes to present to Parliament as soon as possible a Bill which will provide for a restoration of 
elected institutionsin Northern Ireland to which a 
wide range of governmental powers will be devolved. There will be a single-chamber Assembly of about 80 members elected on this occasion by the single transferable vote method of proportional representation applied to the twelve Westminster constituencies. The Office of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will continue and, services reserved to him, 
he will represent Northern Ireland’s interests in the United Kingdom Cabinet.

1. I HAD A LENGTHY TALK THIS AFTERNOON WITH DR. FITZGERALD, 
WHO WAS READING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WHITE PAPER. 2. 
HE WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR, BUT EXPRESSED SOME DISAPPOINTMENT 
ABOUT THE SECTION DEALING WITH THE COUNCIL OF IRELAND. WHILE ITS CONTENTS WERE NOT UNEXPECTED, NONETHELESS IT WOULD Be DIFFICULT TO CONVINCE PUBLIC OPINION IN THE SOUTH THAT WE REALLY MEANT BUSINESS OVER A COUNCIL. ALSO, HE FEARED THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR THE ASSEMBLY TO REJECT THE NOTION OF A COUNCIL OF IRELAND ALTOGETHER. WE MIGHT HAVE MISSED A VALUABLE TRICK BY NOT MAKING PARTICIPATION IN A COUNCIL A CONDITION OF HE RESTITUTION OF AN ASSEMBLY IN THE NORTH. 
3. I REPLIED THAT UNWILLING PARTICIPATION WOULD SURELY GET THE 
COUNCIL NOWHERE. WHAT WE SOUGHT WAS WILLING AND GENUINE PARTICIPATION, WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS MORE LIKELY TO BE ACHIEVED AS A RESULT OF CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES CONCERNED BY MEANS OF THE TRIPARTITE CONFERENCE. THERE WAS NO DIVERGENCE BETWEEN US AS TO OBJECTIVES, SIMPLY HONEST DIFFERENCES OF JUDGEMENT AT VARIOUS POINTS OVER MEANS. DR. FITZGERALD SAID HE ACCEPTED THIS UNRESERVEDLY: THIS HAD BEEN THE EXACT IMPRESSION HE HAD BROUGHT BACK FROM HIS MEETING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AND YOURSELF LAST THURSDAY.

1. I SAW THE TAOISEACH AT 10 O’CLOCK THIS MORNING AND 
GAVE HIM THE PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE AND A COPY OF THE WHITE PAPER. 
2. AFTER READING THE PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE, MR. COSGRAVE 
ASKMED ME A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS MAINLY AOUT POWER-SHARING IN THE EXECUTIVE AND SAFEGUARDS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION. 
HE 
NODDED WHEN I EXPLAINED TO HIM THE PROVISIONS IN THE WHITE PAPER. HE THEN LOOKED QUICKLY THROUGH PART V, ON THE COUNCIL OF IRELAND. ALTHOUGH I SUSPECT IT WILL BE SOMETHING OF A DISAPPOINTMENT, THOUGH NOT A SURPRISE, TO HIM THAT THE PARAGRAPHS DO NOT GO FURTHER IN THE DIRECTION OF A BLUEPRINT, HE DID NOT SAY SO. HE ASKED IF A BILATERAL COUNCiL WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO US. 
I REPLIED THAT THE NATURE OF THE COUNCIL 
AND ALL DETAILS RELATING TO IT WOULD, WE HOPED, BE THE SUBJECT OF THE TRIPARTITE CONFERENCE, BUT THAT MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT WE FOR OUR PART WOULD BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT A BILATERAL COUNCIL, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. MR COSGRAVE AGAIN NODDED. 
3.. HE THEN ASKED ME TO CONVEY HIS THANKS FOR THE PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE AND FOR THE ADVANCE COPY OF THE WHITE PAPER. HE AND HIS CABINET WOULD STUDY THE WHITE PAPER VERY CAREFULLY INDEED, AND WOULD NOT RUSH INTO ANY PREMATURE STATEMENT ABOUT IT.

Northern Ireland White Paper The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern 
Ireland saw Mr. Harold Wilson and Mr. Merlyn Rees in the Prime Minister’s room in the House of Commons on Monday, 19 March 1973, at 6.15 p.m. The Prime Minister gave Mr. Wilson and Mr. Rees each a copy of the Northern Ireland White Paper. 
He said that, in line with 
what Mr. Wilson himself had suggested in the House of Commons, no advance copies would be made available to the press, or indeed to anybody outside official circles except Mr. Wilson and Mr. Rees and the Leader of the Liberal Party. 
The White Paper would be 
published on Tuesday, 20 March, at 2.00 p.m., and the Secretary of State would make a statement in the House of Commons at 3.30 p.m. Mr. Wilson said that he had agreed with Mr. Rees and 
Mr. Stanley Orme that they should accept invitations to appear on television after the publication of the White Paper, but that their line should be that the White Paper was the Government’s document and that what was now appropriate was that the people of Northern Ireland should consider it and decide upon their considered reactions. 
The official Opposition would say nothing which might 
prejudice the reception of the White Paper in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister outlined the main features of the White 
Paper: that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the United Kingdom, so long as the majority of its people wanted it to be so, that there should be no Government of Northern Ireland, no Prime Minister, and no Stormont as it had been known; that there should continue to be a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, a member of the Westminster Government, sitting primarily in Belfast; that there should be an elected Assembly, with certain devolved powers, elected by proportional representation from the

MY GUIDANCE NO 45 OF 16 MARCH: WHITE PAPER ON FUTURE OF NORTHERN IRELAND. 
1. THE WHITE PAPER WILL BE PUBLISHED AT 1300Z ON TUESDAY 20 MARCH. IT IS ENTITLED ’’NORTHERN IRELAND CONSTITUTIONAL PROPOSALS’’, AND IS IN SIX PARTS. 
2. PART 1 ’’THE SEARCH FOR CONSENSUS’’ TAKES AS ITS STARTING POINT PARAGRAPH 79 OF THE DISCUSSION PAPER OF OCTOBER 1972 (GUIDANCE NOS .249 AND 251 OF 1972), AND REVIEWS DEVELOPMENTS SINCE ITS PUBLICATION (ENTRY INTO EEC OF BOTH BRITAIN AND THE IRISH REPUBLIC, THE NEW ANTI-TERRORIST LEGISLATION IN THE REPUBLIC, HMG’S ACCEPTANCE IN PRINCIPLE OF THE DIPLOCK REPORT AND THE BORDER POLL). 
3. PART 2 ’’CONDITIONS FOR A SETTLEMENT’’ SETS OUT THE BASIC CONDITIONS FOR A SETTLEMENT, AND OUTLINES THE OBLIGATIONS INCUMBENT ON CITIZENS OF NORTHERN IRELAND (AND THUS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AS A WHOLE), WHATEVER THEIR VIEWS MAY BE ON THE QUESTION OF IRISH UNITY. IT SETS OUT THE BACKGROUND TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROPOSALS 
- EDUCA- 
TION, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND THE ’’URGENT AND COMPELLIN’’ PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE. 
4. THE ESSENCE OF THE WHITE PAPER IS IN PART 3 ’’THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROPOSALS’’ WHICH CONTAINS THE FRAMEWORK FOR NEW CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THIS ENVISAGES A NEW NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY OF ABOUT 80 MEMBERS ELECTED BY THE SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE SYSTEM OF PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION APPLIED TO THE 12 WESTMINSTER CONSTITUENCIES. IT PROVIDES THAT A COMPREHENSIVE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL DILL FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND WILL BE PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT TO REPLACE THE ARRANGEMENTS TEMPORARILY SET ASIDE BY DIRECT RULE. THERE WILL BE NO INCREASE IN THE PRESENT REPRESENTATION OF NORTHERN IRELAND AT WESTMINESTER. IT ENVISAGES THAT THE NEW ARANGEMENTS WILL

19th March, 1973. 
Northern Ireland Executive: form of oath or affirmation 
With regard to your letter of 16th March to Platt, 
the Lord Chancellor believes that the minimal reference to The Queen required by the Promissory Oaths Act 1868 (but not in his original suggestion) is probably the minimum to hold the Protestants and that it will be acceptable to all but an extremely small section of the Catholics. The Lord Chancellor recognises, however, that this is a matter of judgment, and that it might turn out the other way round, as he had originally thought. 
I am sending copies of this letter to the recipients of copies of yours. Private Secretary C.W. Roberts, Esq.

19 March, 1973. In your letter of 16 March you asked that we consider 
messages from the Prime Minister to the Pope and to President Nixon, and, possibly, to other Heads of State, about the White Paper on Northern Ireland. I now enclose draft messages to the Pope and President Nixon which, if the Prime Minister approves, we can despatch from here. 
We do not think messages to other Heads of State are 
necessary. In the past we have used such messages (on the introduction of Direct Rule and Operation Motorman) when we faced situations which might possibly have ended in bloodshed. At the time of the Paper for Discussion, and again now, we are moving forward on a constitutional path; it is not so necessary to brief Heads of Government personally on developments in what is a purely internal domestic matter for HMG. Posts abroad are being fully briefed. 
The Pope and President Nixon, with both of whom the 
Prime Minister has discussed the matter in recent months. are however in a somewhat different category. 
I am copying this letter to Platt (Northern Ireland Office) and Rucker (Lord President’s Office).

16 March 1973 I wrote to you last night about certain paragraphs 
in the White Paper on Northern Ireland. Since I wrote, Ministers have considered further the 
form of oath to be taken by members of the Executive. It 
may not in fact be appropriate that the oath should take the form prescribed by Section 3 of the Promissory Oaths Act 1868. The last sentence of paragraph 72 has therefore been deleted, and we are left simply with a reference to "an appropriate form of official oath or declaration" (the last two words have been added) at the end of paragraph 52. 
Lt.-Col. the Rt. Hon. Sir Martin Charteris, K.C.B., K.C.V.O., O.B.E.

March 1973 
NORTHERN IRELAND FORECAST OF EVENTS - WEEKEND 16-19 MARCH 1973 
OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1. 
The result of the Border Poll produced the expected reaction from the various 
groups in Northern Ireland but little violence. The overall level of shooting and bombing has increased, but in the case of shooting this has been largely due to an increase in incidents not involving Security Forces. One member of the Security Forces has been killed (by a radio controlled bomb on the border) and Security Forces have claimed one gunman killed, one wounded and eight unconfirmed hits. The Security Force successes in arresting members of the Provisional IRA has continued. Last weekend there was another raid on a gunshop, probably by Protestants. An Order in Council providing power to tighten up the control of firearms was passed during the week. There are signs of increasing momentum in Republican propaganda efforts to discredit Security Force actions and credibility.

16 March 1973 The Prime Minister has seen the letters which you 
and Michael Alexander (FCO) sent to me earlier today about advance copies of the Northern Ireland White Paper. 
and (e) in your letter. 
The Prime Minister agrees with points (a) (b), (c) We will be responsible for 
arranging the meetings with the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Liberal Party on Monday evening. As to point (d) the Prime Minister thinks that the right course would be for the Ambassador to give Mr. Cosgrave an advance copy, together with a message from Mr. Heath at around 10.00 a.m. on the day of publication. 
As to point (f) the Prime Minister would like to send 
messages to the Pope and to President Nixon, to be delivered with copies of the White Paper on the day of publication as soon as possible after 2.00 p.m. 
I understand that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office 
are content with these arrangements and that they will be letting me have by midday on Monday draft messages to Mr. Cosgrave, the Pope and President Nixon. 
I assume that 
the necessary arrangements are being made to get copies of the White Paper to Dublin, Rome and Washington in time for delivery to the appropriate Heads of Government at the times set out above.

16 March, 1973 In your letter of 16 March to Platt in the Northern 
Ireland Office, you asked for recommendations as to when, and to whom, advance copies of the Northern Ireland White 
Paper should be distributed. We had been working on the assumption that the Leader 
of the Opposition and the Leader of the Liberal Party would receive copies on the morning of Tuesday, 20 March, at the same time, or slightly before, the CFRs went to the media; that Mr. Cosgrave would receive his copy at the same hour and Mr. Lynch perhaps a little later. I understand that the Northern Ireland Office now propose that Mr. Wilson, Mr. Thorpe and Mr. Merlyn Rees should receive their copies late on Monday evening, but that Mr. Cosgrave should not receive his until 1.30 p.m. on Tuesday, which is only thirty minutes before the time now proposed for publication, and that Mr. Lynch should not receive an advance copy. 
We recognise the possible embarrassment were it to 
become known that Mr. Lynch had received better treatment than that extended to various political figures in Northern Ireland, and we accept the recommendation of the Northern Ireland Office on this point. But we do not think it would be consistent with the relationship of trust which the Prime Minister is establishing with Mr. Cosgrave were the latter to be treated so cursorily. We know that in the past the Irish have disliked being "informed" only an hour or so in advance, which we deliberately did when we had to undertake unpopular measures and did not wish to give them the chance to object. We know also that Mr. Lynch fully honoured his undertaking to maintain confidentiality when (at a time when we needed his support) he was given a copy of the "Paper for Discussion" to consider over the full weekend before publication. Mr. Cosgrave likewise honoured his undertaking to

16 March 1973 
Thank you for your letter about advance copies of the Northern Ireland White Paper. 
In the light of your letter and of the exchange between the Leader of the Opposition and the Lord President on the Business Question yesterday the Secretary of State would like to make the following proposals: 
(a) He agrees that there should be no release of CFRs at 9 am on the day of publication. Instead he now proposes that the White Paper should be published at 2 pm, and accordingly made available in the Vote Office and to the Press at that time. This will avoid the difficulties of CFRs, but enable the evening Press in London and, we hope, Belfast to make informed comment rather than to speculate. It will also enable the Secretary of State to record, before going to the House of Commons, a mini-Ministerial broadcast for the early evening television programmes. 
(b) Advance copies of the White Paper should be given to the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Liberal Party on Monday evening at meetings with the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. The meetings would be on Privy Councillor terms, although the Secretary of State would wish Mr Merlyn Rees to be invited to attend with Mr Wilson. The contents of the White Paper and the arrangements for the following day would be explained at those meetings. 
(c) The Governor of Northern Ireland, the General Officer Commanding, the Chief Constable and the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland would receive advance copies as early as practicable on the day of publication. 
(d) On the basis of (a) above Mr Cosgrave would receive an advance copy at 1.30 pm on the day of publication. 
(e) At 2 pm on the day of publication copies would be delivered to Mr Lynch, the Secretary of State’s Advisory Commission, the Party leaders in Northern Ireland, church leaders and the Permanent Secretaries of Northern Ireland Departments.

The Irish Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Garret Fitzgerald, 
accompanied by Mr. Hugh McCann, and the Irish Ambassador, came to see the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs at 10 Downing Street on Thursday 15 March 1973 at 7.15 p.m. The Prime Minister thanked Dr. Fitzgerald for the message which 
the Irish Cabinet had sent earlier in the day about the forthcoming constitutional proposals for Northern Ireland. been considered by the Cabinet. 
This message had had already been adopted; others were being considered. 
Some of the suggestions made in it As he had 
explained to Mr. Cosgrave and Mr. Corish a week earlier, it was not possible for the British Government to be as specific about the composition and terms of reference of a Council of Ireland as the Irish Government were suggesting. Dr. Fitzgerald said that he brought greetings from Mr. Cosgrave 
and Mr. Corish to the Prime Minister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. 
He was glad to have this opportunity of meeting them, 
and grateful to them for arranging the meeting at short notice. Dr. Fitzgerald said that the new Irish Government desired good He thought that the 
It relations with the British Government. Taoiseach’s inaugural speech augured well for these relations. 
was notable that Mr. Lynch, in his first speech as Leader of the Opposition, had addressed some of his remarks directly to the majority in Northern Ireland. 
So indeed had the Taoiseach. Dr. Fitzgerald 
said that he had been encouraged to find that in relation to the constitutional proposals for Northern Ireland there was complete identity of view between the former Irish Government and the new Government. 
In the message which his Government had sent earlier 
in the day, they had tried to avoid exacerbating feelings, and to offer useful points.

12 noon today to hand over a memorandum (of which I enclose a copy) setting out the views of Mr. Cosgrave and his Cabinet on Northern Ireland. 
The Irish Ambassador called on Robert Armstrong at straight away. 
The Prime Minister wishes to send a short acknowledgement We will draft this here; and after clearing 
it with the Prime Minister forward it to you for transmission through the Embassy in Dublin. 
like to send a fuller message to Mr. Cosgrave which would be delivered with his advance copy of the White Paper on the day of publication. 
It would go on- and this would be the main purpose of the message - to emphasise the The Prime Minister would also 
that we had considered carefully the points he raised when he was in London last week and those in the memorandum delivered this morning by his Ambassador. 
This message might assure Mr. Cosgrave again 
many important respects in which the White Paper proposals are on the lines advocated by Dublin; and it would also deal with the main issues on which we are not meeting Dublin’s views, for example in that the White Paper does not set out in detail the functions and representation of the Council of Ireland. 
I should be grateful if a draft message on these lines 
could be prepared in consultation with the Northern Ireland Office and could reach me by mid-day on Monday 19 March. 
to Platt (Northern Ireland. Office), Nicholls (Ministry of Defence) and Norbury (Cabinet Office). 
I am sending copies of this letter, and of the enclosure,

NORTHERN IRELAND AND HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE 
Deedes plus 30 Members They discussed security in the UK. Most contributions 
were direct to security in the House which seemed rather narrow. The main points raised were. 1. 
Identity Cards Several Members said that they should 
be introduced throught the UK. Biggs DAvison, Deedes, Wall, Churchill, Corfield, Fookes, (who said that the public should be softened up to the idea), J. Page, Goodhart, Morgan-Giles, Kilfedder and Longden. Some Members expressed doubts about the use of it - Fraser and Marten. 2. 
There were calls to declare the IRA illegal. Soref, 
McMaster, Winterton (Government is weak and woolly), Kilfedder. 3. 
Strong appeals were made to restore capital punishment. 
Soref, Corfield, (live prisoners are hell to deal with, much easier to have a corpse), Fookes, J. Page, Wiggin and Churchill (we shall never get this until the Payroll is wheeled in). 4. 
Much criticism of House of Lords security and general 
acceptance that someone will loose off a bomb or assassination before long. Marten, Haselhurst, Renton, Churchill, Fraser, McMaster, Longden (who wanted all lobbying stopped) Winterton, Kilfedder. In particular, there were strong demands for Members cars to be searched. 
Other points raised were:

Hobert Armstrong Esq 10 Downing Street Whitehall SW1 
15 March 1973 
I enclose a revised version of paragraphs 52, 72 and 81 of the White Paper on Northern Ireland. 
Paragraphs 52 and 72 have been re-drafted in the light of discussion at Cabinet this morning to deal with the difficult question of subversive elements in the Executive and an oath. 
The Secretary of State has followed up the suggestions made by the Lord Chancellor in Cabinet and has read over to him the enclosed re-draft. The Lord Chancellor is content with this revise and the Secretary of State is this evening letting the Private Offices of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and Defence Secretary know what is proposed. 
As regards paragraph 81 which in fact deals with the position of the Governor, the Secretary of State has re-drafted the passage in a way which he feels will be best likely to be acceptable to the Governor personally and to relevant sections of opinion in Northern Ireland. As you will see greater prominence is given to the continuation of strong links with the Crown and indeed the paragraph heading itself has been altered to give additional stress to this point.

Formation of the Executive 52. There is no future for devolved institutions of government in Northern Ireland unless majority and minority alike can be so bound. This is not to say that any "right of veto" can be conceded to violent, subversive or unconstructive elements determined, if they can, to undermine any new system from the outset. But the Government does not believe that this is the wish of the overhelming majority in either community. What has to be found through their representatives - is a system of exercising executive power in Northern Ireland which is broadly acceptable to them. One important means of ensuring this will be more effective participation by the Assembly as a whole, through its structure of committees, in the development of policy; but it is the view of the Government that the Executive itself can no longer be solely based upon any single party, if that party draws its support and its elected representation virtually entirely from only one section of a divided community. The Executive must be composed of persons who are prepared to work together by peaceful means for the benefit of the community. Members of the Executive will be required to take an appropriate form of official oath on taking up their appointment (see paragraph 72). 
Appointment of Heads of Departments. 72. The constitutional Bill will provide that the formal appointment of persons to be the political Heads of Departments in Nothern Ireland for the purpose of administering services under the devolved executive powers will be effected by the Secretary of State. These Departments will include a central secretariat whose political Head will lead the Assembly and preside over the Executive. This is a power of appointment analogous with that conferred upon the Governor by Section 8 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920, but when an agreed understanding on the formation of an Executive is reached in discussion with elected representatives, it would be the intention to make appointments in accordance with that understanding. On appointment the Had of a Department will be

AT STORMONT CASTLE ON 14 MARCH 1973 PRESENT: 
Mr I Cooper Mr A Currie Mr J Hume 
Mr P Devlin Mr F Steele Mr T Platt Mr C Abbott 
Opening the meeting the Secretary of State said that he (1) welcomed the maximum possible discussion of Northern Ireland’s future; (2) thought that there were a number of areas in the economic and social fields 
for co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Any such developments should be based on consent following full discussion by those concerned; 
(3) did not feel that the SDLP’s condominium proposal would work because of the problems which would arise when the two Governments disagreed. Moreover, Protestant opinion had first to become accustomed to the view that there was a value in working with the Republic. 
SDLP representatives made the following points (1) A pre-condition to progress was that there must be no return to Protestant ascendancy. 
(2) The essence of the conflict was the clash of loyalties and consequently both should be recognised. That was why they had proposed joint sovereignty. Symbols of both loyalties, for example emblems, should be permitted. 
(3) The Government’s long-term intention should be made clear, especially as regards a Council of Ireland. Such a Council should have real responsibility in, for example, the fields of tourism and electricity. They hoped that a Council of Ireland would operate in the political as well as the economic and social fields. 
(4) Policing presented a major problem, the solution to which would be a new police force. At present the RUC lacked the confidence of the minority community. They felt themselves regarded as subvertionists by the police. The Secretary of State agreed that the acceptability of the police was vital. Be pointed out that there had been a significant number of arrests recently among violent men on both sides.

Secretary of St e Mr F Steele Mr T Roberts Mr T Platt 
Hull 
LOYALIST COUNCIL AT 12 NOON ON WEDNESDAY 14 MARCH IN STORMONT CASTLE Present: 
Herron 
Mr Henderson Mr Green Mr Crowe 
The Secretary of State said that the United Loyalist Council (ULC) had asked to see him again, and in accordance with his previous undertaking he had agreed to see them before the publication of the White Paper. There was a number of points which he wished to put to the ULC. The fact that the Border Poll had been held, its form and timing, demonstrated that the British Government could be trusted to keep their word. The result of the Poll would be fully honoured by the Government, and this would be made clear in the forthcoming White Paper. There was therefore no justification for any fear of a "sell out" and certainly no justification for any form of violence. He hoped that the White Paper would be carefully considered. It would not be an end in itself and there would be opportunity for the proposals to be modified in the light of representations and discussions. If despite what he had said people turned to violence the full force of the security forces would be used to suppress it. 
Mr Henderson said that the ULC were mostly not politicians, they were simply patriots interested in the future of their country. They were particularly concerned about the security situation, the failure of the security forces to take up their offers of assistance and the use of detention against Loyalists. 
Mr Hull said that before the introduction of Direct Rule he had led a demand for internment. He fully accepted that if people committed subversive acts the State had to take action. But he was concerned about the treatment of Loyalists. Some had been arrested in their houses during the night and their families abused. Internment was being improperly used in order to get people out of the way before the publication of the White Paper. He was convinced that some of the Loyalists detained under Interim Custody Orders could not have been guilty of subversive acts. Mr Herron said that by their acts the Army were alienating the Loyalist community and encouraging the establishment of a Protestant counterpart to the IRA. 
There might in the past have been Ulster Defence Association (UDA) clubs selling

OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST PARTY AT 12 30 PM ON TUESDAY, 13 MARCH 1973, IN STORMONT CASTLE 
Present: 
Secretary of State Mr T C Platt 
Dr Ian Paisley MP Rev W Beattie MP Mr J McQuade 
Dr Paisley said that in the view of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) it was important that the representatives of the people should have a real say in the affairs of Northern Ireland. 
It was also important to lift Northern Ireland politics out 
of their past and present parochial context into the broader contex of the United Kingdom rather than into what the Paper for Discussion had described as the Irish Dimension.

If this were done the minority community could fully participate in The DUP considered, however, that it was not 
The DUP had been particularly incensed at the 
statement by the Social Democratic and Labour Party that they would call off the rent and rate strike if the White Paper was "acceptable". Finally, the DUP were anxious that the proposals in the Diplock Report should be implemented as soon as possible. 
The Secretary of State said that the Diplock Report would be implemented separately and before the constitutional proposals. 
endorse the results of the Border Poll on the continuation of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. 
The fact that the Poll had been held, its form and timing, demonstrated that the British Government kept their word. This should go 
some way to reassuring those who still had doubts about the Government’s determination to preserve the integrity of Northern Ireland. 
On security he hoped that people 
would recognize the substantial achievements of the security forces and, in particular, of the RUC in arresting and charging murderers. 
In the brief discussion which followed the following additional points were also raised:- 
He emphasized that the White Paper would

(ii) The Bill ill declare that Northern Ireland will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of its people (para. 32). 
(iii) As part of the United Kingdom Northern Ireland will maintain its existing representation of twelve members in the United Kingdom Parliment (para.33). 
(iv) There will be a Northern Ireland Assembly of about 80 members elected on this occasion by the single transferable vote method of proportional representation applied to the twelve Westminster Constituencies (para.39). Elections to the Assembly will be held as soon as possible (para. 40). 
(v)

Cabinet: Northern Ireland White Paper (CP(73) 30) 
You will wish to inform the Cabinet that:(a) Publication is at present envisaged for Tuesday, 20th March (on 
which basis the final text should be with the printer by the evening of Friday). (b) For obvious reasons of security no announcement about the precise 
timing of publication will be made in advance. (c) 
in hand. 2. You will then wish to direct the Cabinet’s attention to the substance 
of the White Paper. They should be told that it has been considered in detail by GEN 79,whose main criticism was directed to its form - i. e. to the absence of any clear and concise summary of its proposals,showing how they interlock and reinforce one another. The Secretary of State has attempted to remedy this defect by producing a Summary for insertion at the beginning of Part 6. 
I hope that the text of this Summary may have 
been circulated to the Cabinet in advance; but, if not, it will be available to be handed round. 
3. For the rest, you will presumably not wish to take the Cabinet 
through the White Paper paragraph by paragraph. But I attach a note on the main points which engaged the attention of GEN 79, with an indication of the line which the Committee were disposed to adopt. It might be most convenient if you took these points in order, indicating the suggested amendments; then asked the Secretary of State for his own view; and finally asked the Cabinet to reach a decision point by point. 
Security precautions, both in Northern Ireland and in London, are

He was told that the Coalition Party now in power were prepared to listen to moderate voices in the North. Mr Simpson told

Presented to the Secretary of State by the NILP at the meeting of 13 March 1973 
NORTHERN IRELAND LABOUR PARTY 1 - 5 CHEVIOT AVENUE, BELFAST BT4 3AG 
Secretary: DOUGLAS McILDOON MEMORANDUM FOR MEETING WITH MR WHITELAW. 
(i) In stressing the importance of the electoral system we would point to the adventagous effect of p.r. in other conflict ridden societies 
- for example it was an 
intrinsic part of the 1913 Dutch settlement, it enables democracy to survive in Italy by creating a buffer betwen the Communists and the Christian Democras, it enables National Minorities such as Swedes in Finland to participate in government it enables extreme left wing parties 
- such as the Communists in Sweden on the 
Socialist Peoples party in Denmark to play an important and legitimate parlament role. Our own experience of P.R. in 1920 in local government and in 1925 electionswas that it enabled a non-sectarian group to establish a bridgehead. At that time the bridgehead was destroyed by the Unionists. P.R. could again result in the establishment of a bridgehead from which could be launched a general assault on the power and positions of the sectarian parties. 
(ii) In opposing a system of power sharing by allocating a proportion of executive places to political parties which to all intents and purposes are bound together not by common principle but by the same religion, we believe again that the evidence of history is on our side. In the 1890’s when the boundaries of Belfast were being extended Catholic pressure grew for the creation of Catholic wards. This pressure was successful. Two of the 15 wards were delibrately created with enormous Catholic majorities and these wards were never even contested by Unionists. This had two results. The first is that Catholics were always under represented on the City Council. The second is that those wards created a Catholic vested interest i sectarian politics and these wards have almost always been held by politicians who most succosfully pandered to Catholic fears, prejudices and grievences. The existence of Catholic tribal leaders not only has a bad effect on the Catholic community. It also provokes, justifies and perpetuates on equally,pernicious kind of politics on the Protestant side. The politicans those Catholic areas have thrown up are in no small part to blame or the conflicts of recent years. It is worth noticing that the Nationalist leader and subsequent .P. for West Belfast Joe Devlon foresaw the dangers of creating these two wards and opposed the plan which he said would perpetuate the conflict. 
(iii) THE ECONOMIC DIMENSION 
We have already pointed out to the Prime Minister the positive relationship between the percentage unemployed in a district and the degree of violence emenating fro, that district. We see no hope of any settlement working which does not provide everyone with opportunity of worthwhile employment. 
(iv) THE COUNCIL OF IRELAND 
The establishment of peace and harmony throughout the island requires much more thaninter-governmental co-operation. Indeed inter-governmental co-operation free 
from opposition or minority party secrutiny might cause more suspicion that harmony. We feel it is essential to establish inter-parliamentary nature of the council a) 
so that parties suspicious of the very concept of a council of Ireland can maintain a witching brick b) So that parties with similar outlooks on economic and social issues separated by national bordrs or by religion, can begin to cO-operate in pursuit of their common objectivs.

PRIME MINISTER 
Constitutional Proposals for Northern Ireland: Draft White Paper (CP(73) 30) 
I hope that, after seeing for the first time the separate elements of the 
proposed settlement within a single, comprehensive framework, Ministers will feel that this text is a very valiant shot at an extremely difficult target. It is well written; and, given the hypothesis of a gradualist or evolutionary approach, it is a persuasive presentation of its main features. 2. 
several minor respects. The latter are itemised, for convenience, in the annex to this brief. 
But they are relatively unimportant; some are little 
more than questions of drafting. The major point onwhich I feel doubt is the clarity of the document on the one issue on which public opinion of all shades will fasten as soon as it 
Nevertheless, it seems to me to be open to criticism in one major and published - namely, the means by which 
power is to be shared in such a way as to guarantee the minority both effective participation in government and protection against discrimination in ordinary life. 
Parts 3 and 4 of the White Paper leave me with an 
impression of scrappiness on this issue, in the sense that individual subjects are discussed initially in particular paragraphs, are picked up again several paragraphs later and, in some cases, yet again still later, At no point does one get a clear, succinct, statement of the manner in which the various safeguards envisaged by the White Paper will interlock in such a way as to reinforce one another and to provide a systematic structure of both constitutional and social rights and obligations. 3. 
This is very much a matter of subjective judgment; and, given 
the intractable nature of the subject,matter and the complexity of the interrelated issues, one may be quite wrong in suggesting that the White Paper could deal with them in a more clear and less diffuse way. (In any event an evolutionary approach may positively require 
- and derive 
advantage from - a rather more opaque and piecemeal presentation!). But I am left with an uneasy, albeit indefinable, feeling that a lot of very good material could be displayed even more effectively.

had, in any event, established that elections could be held in Northern Ireland. As he had indicated in his letter of invitation he was, for his part, clear from the Unionist Party documents and the various meetings he had had with them about their views on the future constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland. 
In 
accordance with his earlier undertaking, however, he wished to give the Unionist Party representatives an opportunity to put any further views to him although he would not be in a position to respond at this stage to what they said. 
Mr Faulkner said that the Unionist Party very much appreciated the fact that their arguments on the timing and form of the Border Poll had been accepted.

There

said that the United Kingdom Government intended to propose that the Executive could not be based upon any single party, if that party drew its support and its representation virtually entirely from one section of a divided community. 
The Prime Minister But it would be for the 
parties represented in the Assembly to decide after the elections how they could best work together, provided that they did so on a non-sectarian basis. 
powers to be devolved to the Executive would be generally ones, such as education and agriculture, on which there was no great division between the parties; and there would be a specific legal safeguard against discrimination. Mr. Cosgrave and Mr. Corish suggested that it would be a 
retrograde step to increase the representation of Northern Ireland at Westminster.

Appendix 1 to Annex A to A/BR/30/8/M04 Dated 26 March 1973 
ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT IN THE FLAT AT 358 ANTRIM RD ON FRIDAY 23 MARCH 1973 1. 
2. 
Many of the details are still not clear and this is only a preliminary report. Five SNCOs; SSgt GREEN RAOC, SSgt FOSTER DERR, Sgt PENROSE RCT, Sgt MULDOON 
RADC and Sgt WOLSEY QRIH were invited by two women to a "house warming" party at 358 Antrim Rd on the evening of Friday 23 March. The first four SNCOs are stationed at HQ Northern Ireland and Sgt WOLSEY is a member of 93/95 AYT. 
3. Sgt WOLSEY was unable to attend the party because of a previous engagement 
but will be able to identify the two women. He says that Sgt PENROSE had met the two women at the Woodland Hotel Lisburn on the 12 March and again at the request of one of the women on the 19 March. It was at the latter mooting that the "house warming" party was arranged. 
4. 5. It would appear from information from SSgt GREEN that there was one woman at 
the flat when the four SNCOs arrived by car. It is not yet known whether this woman left to get more women or whether more women arrived and one of them went off. 
However one woman returned with two men one of whom was armed with a Thompson 
SMG and the other of whom was armed with a pistol. The four SNCOs were forced to lie on a double bed and then shot. SSgt FOSTER and Sgt MULDOON were killed and Sgt PENROSE has since died in hospital. 
6. 7. SSgt GREEN who is VSI in hospital was able to raise the alarm. It is believed that the flat was hired by the women, using fictitious names, 
on 19 March. 8. 
With the assistance of Sgt WOLSEY Scotland Yard have been able to produce 
two Identikit pictures which have been sent to the RUC. 9. 
HQ Northern Ireland’s comment is that it appears from the prior arrangements 
which had been made and the fact that the flat had been laid out for a party that this was a well planned premeditated murder.

26th March 1973 We spoke earlier today about the murder last weekend of 
three soldiers in Belfast, and I promised to send you a note. I explained to you that the soldiers involved were out of 
bounds at the time of the shooting. Under existing regulations virtually all of Belfast is out of bounds, except that four or more men may go into the City centre during daylight hours; the shooting took place at night. (You may like to know, however, that the pub at Lisburn where the first meeting took place is within bounds.) 
The soldiers should have known what the position was. 
Every week a general instruction is promulgated by the GOC to which the attention of all ranks is drawn, and this lays down which areas of Belfast are out of bounds 
- in practice 
there is little if any change in the geographical limits from week to week, but the reiteration is intended to serve as a reminder. Disciplinary action is of course taken against anyone acting in breach of this instruction. 
The regulations are self-explanatory and are not 
susceptible to any tightening up; as a result of this incident everyone will have been reminded of their existence, although the details of the incident were sufficiently gruesome and it has been so widely publicized that this should not really be necessary.
