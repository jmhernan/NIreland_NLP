NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 270700 HRS TO 300700 HRS OCTOBER 1972 GENERAL 
1. The level of violence was low. On Fri/Sat there were 31 shooting 
incidents (16 involving SF) and nil explosions; on Sat/Sun 22 (13) and one; and on Sun/Mon 17 (12) and 2, making a total over the three days of 70 shooting incidents (41 involving SF) and only 3 explosions. Casualties included one L/Sgt of 2 SG killed by a sniper in Londonderry and 2 other soldiers, one of them UDR, slightly wounded; two terrorists claimed hit (one in Belfast and one in Armagh, both on Saturday); and one civilian killed (a 16 year old RC shot on Sunday from a passing car in Cliftonville, Belfast, a mixed area) and six wounded. There were no major incidents over the weekend and nine marches in Belfast on Sunday were held without any trouble. About 1800 orangemen attended seven of the marches and the other two were by PD (1000) and NICRA (300), themes not known. 
(31), UVF serving 
6 years for armed robbery, escaped on Friday from the Crumlin Road Jail. In the Republic, seven IRA Provos, four of them reportedly from Ulster, names not yet known, escaped from the Curragh military prison by tunneling. UVF are being blamed for causing small fires in four Dublin hotels, and for planting a bomb (defused by Irish ATO) at the railway station in Dublin serving Belfast. The Provisional Sein Fein AGM was held in Dublin on Sat/ Sun. There were reportedly 1000 delegates, 200 of them from Ulster. Rory O’Brady was unanimously reelected President. He apparently stressed the Provisional plan for a United Socialist Irish Republic based on regional government for the four anicent Irish Kingdoms. John Stephenson reportedly urged parallel political /military action. If there was a theme, it could be said to be a new emphasis on political action through local issues, north and south. In GB, weekend press comment almost universally welcomed the postponement of the local government elections. Other comment was largely devoted to speculation about the contents and likely effect of the publication of HMGs paper for discussion

Annex A to A/BR/30/1/M04 Dated 25 October 1972 
HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING 25 OCTOBER 1972 
BACKGROUND 1. 
General. The week was relatively quiet and saw the cessation of Protestant 
inspired violence. 2. 
IRA Activity. Provisional IRA activity in Belfast and Londonderry has 
remained at a relatively low level with a total of 158 shooting incidents and 20 explosions. Londonderry continues to suffer hooligan activity with the Security Forces the main target. There has been no increase in border or rural activity although in one serious incident one UDR soldier was killed and another, his brother, injured. The soldier seriously injured in the booby-trapped house in Armagh died on 24 October, and another soldier was shot dead in a single shot sniping incident in the Falls. There have been further indications that the Provisionals are losing support. Andersonstown,once the hardest area in the City has been progressively quieter since Operation Motorman. Residents of a number of housing estates there have reportedly expressed their wish for the IRA to end hostilities and the local IRA battalion is known to be thoroughly disorganised. There are indications that the Provisional IRA in Belfast is suffering from lack of effective leadership; Seamus Twomey may be in the Republic and the continued SF domination seriously restricts IRA command and control. In Londonderry, where there continue to be conflicting reports of IRA undergoing training in nearby County Donegal, the Provisionals issued a statement on 18 October warning that anyone in the city "found collaborating with the RUC or the Army verbally or otherwise would be executed accordingly". 
3. Protestant Activity. Evidence that the UDA, whilst attempting to conceal the 
part they played in the violence of the previous week, were in fact encouraging it, was highlighted during the week. William Craig’s "shoot and kill" outburst offended moderates but regrettably attracted Vanguard and UDA rank and file support. After a meeting between UDA and senior Army officers on 18 October the UDA issued instructions ordering the abeyance of further confrontations with the Army. This order seems to have been largely obeyed although UDA patrol presence has not diminished. Sectarian attacks have however continued, spreading from the city to the country. Realising the greater difficulty in protecting isolated targets ’midnight marauders’ burnt Catholic-owned haysheds, a church, a church hall and two schools in the countryside. Perhaps the most significant and, from all the available evidence, extreme Protestant activity of the week was the theft of weapons from the Lurgan TAVR Centre in the early hours of 23 October. In this raid 104 weapons were stolen, of which 69 were recovered within four hours. Vanguard Headquarters is thought to be planning a number of courses of action designed to disrupt the local Government elections. The Loyalist Defence Volunteers declared that the "loyal British people of Ulster would not tolerate the imposition of the Proportional Representation system of voting". 
4. Security Force Activity. Troops redeployed during last week’s Protestant 
rioting have returned to the hard IRA areas and the week has been fairly quiet though tense. There has been no reduction in force levels and selective anti-terrorist operations have continued, including finds of 24 weapons and arrests of 13 IRA officers.

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING 18 OCTOBER 1972 
1. General. 
Defence Association (UDA) were about to mount coordinated attacks on Catholic properties located in predominantly Protestant areas. 
Throughout the week there were persistent rumours that the Ulster These rumours were supported 
when during Wednesday night UDA and Tartan gangs rampaged in the Shankill and .East Belfast. 
(SF) to recapture ’Gusty Spence’ an escaped murderer and acknowledged UVF leader. 59 Protestant arrests were made but subsequently all were released. 
There was only one serious SF casualty and it is likely that the reaction was instinctive rather than contrived. on Sunday night and has continued each night since. 
Major rioting followed an operation mounted by the Security Forces During the 
same night there were at least 18 separate incidents of fire being directed at SF from within Protestant areas. 
Though the following 
night was less active intersectarian incidents continued according to the expected pattern. 
Extreme Protestant activity both anti-Catholic and anti-SF occurred After renewed rioting in East 
Belfast and the Shankill on Monday night in which there were at least 40 Protestant shooting incidents at SF, the UDA issued a statement calling on all Loyalists to withdraw cooperation from the Army and the Whitelaw administration ".......to hell with the British Ary, to hell with the Whitelaw administration. Ary and the British Government are now our enemies". 
The British On Tuesday night there was 
no let-up and Protestant terrorists engaged SF in over 50 shooting incidents unprovoked either by IRA or SF. 
IRA shooting incidents and bomb attacks. 
Meanwhile there has been a slight decrease in Despite this overall decrease there 
were a number of serious IRA incidents including a brutal attack on a Catholic magistrate renowned for his firm attitude towards terrorism. For different reasons both Republican and Protestant extremists now seem united in their opposition to the local government elections on 6 December. 
Six Provisional Officers were 
arrested including the OC of the Newry Provisional Company; the operations officer of the 1st Belfast Bn and two of those believed to be involved in the murders of CSgt Ruddy (UDR, brutally murdered last week); and Spr Stewart (shot in the Four Square Laundry incident). 
2. Protestant Activities. 
the week which included the first sustained shooting attacks by extreme Protestants against SF since Internment Week. 
on Catholic properties, including three churches, continued. Extremist Tartan 
gang activity took place on the Sunday and Monday nights, both nights beginning with attacks on Catholic properties but becoming entirely anti-SF when the Army intervened. 
Information that UVF leaders, including Gusty Spence, were meeting 
on Wednesday evening in a Shankill Club led to the temporary arrest of 59 Protestants. On Tuesday the UDA in Londonderry claimed responsibility for destroying a fertiliser factory, an alleged source of IRA explosives, across the border in the Republic.

(ii) The Diplock Commission Names of the 3 members serving on the Commission would be announced shortly. 
(iii) Tribunals

3. Protestant Extremists 
The risk of militant Protestant activity over the coming weekend was discussed, and in particular the danger of the UVF operating under the cover of UDA offers of assistance to the Army in controlling Tartans. It was agreed that the Secretary of State should be alerted to the risks of Protestant activity over the weekend. 
The next NIOM will be held at noon on Tuestay 17 October in Conference Room "B". The meeting on Friday 20 October will be held in Room 35 (on the same floor). Present:

OUTLOOK 
4. Reiorts have been received that militant Protestant activity is likely to escalate at the weekend. Details are not available but it will probably take the form of that of the 11 October 1972. Continuing Protestant activity may then spread to Rural areas durin the coming week. 
5. If Protestant violence-is aimed against Catholic people or pronerty, then 6i 
the Provisional IRA will enage in a counter reaction in their ; sned capacity as defenders of the minority. The Provisionals can be expected to continue their campaign against the Security Forces along much the same lines 
as in recent weeks. 6.

NOTE OF A MEETING AT NOON ON 6 OCTOBER 1972 1. The Chairman reported the general conclusions reached by Ministers that morn- 
ing on the timing of possible political developments and other matters, and said that work in the Northern Ireland Office on the setting up of tribunals and the Diplock Commission was proceeding urgently. 
2. The meeting discussed the possibility that the Sunday Times Insight team might 
publish an article on the use of patrols in plain clothes by the Army. The information services have been working hard on countering IRA propaganda about "assassination squads" by making the facts available to the press. The line should be taken that it is natural and essential for the security forces to have recourse to patrols in plain clothes. If an unreasonable article did, appear this Sunday, it was possible that a reply might be delivered in a major speech. 
3. Although there has been little change in the security situation, two dangers 
in particular remain: that Provisionals who have been in the Republic will step up their activity in Northern Ireland; and that Protestant extremists will grow in strength. Any information about the Provisionals in the Republic which could be passed to the authorities there for action should be sent to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 
4. The next meetings are due to take place at noon on 10 and 13 October in Conference Room B.

The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. The weekly intelligence report as at 6 October 1972 has been issued 
separately. OUTLOOK 4. 
October 1972 6 OCTOBER 1972 01-930-7022 Ext 7876 Provisional IRA activity may be expected to continue to comprise mainly of 
sniping attacks against the Security Forces in Belfast and the rural areas, and attempts to mine Security Force vehicles in the country. In border areas, while the Provisional IRA are able to mount raids from the Republic, continuing attacks must be expected particularly around Strabane, Clady and Castlederg. 
5. The Official IRA are likely to continue to place their main emphasis on 
political activities in preparation for the forthcoming local government elections: they are likely to increase their propaganda activity designed to ensure the removal of the proscription of Republican Clubs in order that their candidates may stand as representatives of this political grouping. The forthcoming Official Republican sponsored rallies in Londonderry are likely to be well attended and act as a focus for political attack. 
6. 7. The likelihood for further interfactional incidents remains. Any interference 
by the Security Forces will result in fire from both groups being directed onto the soldiers. 
There continues to be divergent views amongst Protestant extremists as to 
what their future activities should be, particularly as Darlington has not given them a focus for opposition. The possibility exists of increased emphasis on attacks on suspected IRA members or premises.

NIOM(72) 40 NOTE OF A MEETING AT NOON ON 3 OCTOBER 
THE COMMISSION 1. 
There will be a maximum of 5 members. Lord Diplock has accepted the post of 
Chairman and it is hoped to nominate the other members soon. THE TRIBUNAL 2. 
GEN 79 3. 
Legislation to set up Tribunals is at present being drafted. Two papers concerning Northern Ireland will go to Gen 79 on Friday. The first 
by the Secretary of State deals with progress on the Green Paper and puts forward a tentative timetable for action in the next 3-6 months. 4. 
The second has been written by a Committee of Permanent Secretaries from the 
Northern Ireland Civil Service, and discusses possible future constitutional arrangements. IRISH STATE CASE AT STRASBOURG 5. 
Some of the allegations by the Irish Government concerning Britain’s actions 
in Northern Ireland have been ruled admissible by the European Commission on Human Rights. It is possible however, that the Irish Government might drop the case brfore the allegations themselves are heard. Further action should wait until the constitutional proposals for Northern Ireland are more firmly settled. 6. 
The Attorney General has written to the NIO and the FCO, saying that not 
enough was made of our success in having some of the charges withdrawn. The FCO will reply. OPERATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE 7. 
The Official IRA’s threat to call off the ceasefire was probably made to take 
advantage of the publicity gained thereby. It seems they are more worried about the inter-factional struggle between themselves and the Provisionals and the statement was probably made in an attempt to reassert their influence over events in Northern Ireland.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 290700HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 to 020700 HOURS OCTOBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
The level of violence was higher than previous weekends over the last two 
months. On Fri/Sat there were 50 shootings and two explosions, on Sat/Sun 53 shooting incidents and 4 explosions. On Sun/Mon 27 shootings and one explosion. Casualties totaled 2 soldiers killed and 3 wounded ( 1 x VSI); 6 RUC wounded; 18 terrorists claimed hit, and 5 civilians killed and 30 wounded. Most of the trouble was in Belfast with Londonderry and the Rural areas relatively quiet. The major violence was in the Lower Falls area which continued throughout Friday afternoon and evening and seems to have been started by Provisional action against the Officials-this being a predominately Official area. The bombing of a Catholic club, perhaps by Provisionals, and a funeral procession were the main cause and apportunity for the serious violence between the factions and against Security Forces. 
This 
developed on Saturday into attacks on Security Force posts mainly in the Falls, but died away during the late evening with Sunday being mainly quiet. Meanwhile the Vanguard rally passed off without violence. ZU3 estimates of the attendance were 15000 including a parade of UDA members some wearing masks and carrying cudgels.

25 October 1972 Cabinet agreed this morning that the 
Local Government elections in Northern Ireland should be postponed. Your Secretary of State said that he had not finally decided whether It would be better to announce this decision tomorrow, Thursday or to do so next week when the plebiscite bill has been published. 
When the Prime Minister met Mr. Lynch at 
the Summit LAst week, he gave im an account of the expected timetable of events in Northern Ireland over the coming months. 
He feels 
therefore that he must tell Mr. Lynch of the postponement of the Local Government elections before 
announcement is made. I should therefore be - but only shortly before - a public 
grateful if, in consultation with The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, you could let me have a draft message for the Prime Minister to send to Mr. Lynch. This draft should reach this office as soon as possible, and in any case in time for it to be considered by the Prime Minister and despAtched to Dublin in time to reach Mr. Lynch before the announcement is made. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Alexander (Foreign and Commonwealth Office).

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 200700 TO 230700 OCTOBER 1972 GENERAL 
1. The level of violence remained relatively low. On Fri/Sat there were twenty two shootingincidents and three explosions; on Sat/Sun twenty seven and two; and on Sun/Mon nineteen and one. There were no civilian casualties at all. One terrorist was claimed hit. SF casualties were one private in 4 UDR murdered, one RUC constable died of injuries received on 17 Oct, and two regular soldiers and two UDR men were wounded. The major incidents were a gun battle between 1 QUEENS and some Provisionals in NEW LODGE on Sunday afternoon (no casualties on either side); and the theft of 106 weapons (but only 1500 rounds of ammunition) from the 11 UDR (& TA) armoury at Lurgan. Of the 85 SLPs taken 78 were UDR and of the 21 SMG, 19 were UDR. The raiders, who claimed to be UVF, were apparently mistaken for UDR coming on duty by the 
sentry. GB Sunday press comment covered the 
outburst of Protestant militance last week (the two day wars S Times); and tended to support the view that Craig had more supporters than detractorsin Ulster for his shoot and kill/bullets not ballots statement. The Sunday Telegraph named the UDA 13 man inner council. Robin BAILIE, the former Stormont Minister and Unionist moderate, contributed an important article to the Observer, presumably as a moderate Protestant reply to the earlier articles by Conor Cruise O’Brien. On BBC 1 on Sunday evening SSNI appared on ’A Chance to Meet’. Postcard questions were reportedly the heaviest yet for any single interview on this. series and the majority asked ’why not withdraw the Army’, a sentiment predictably supported by Derek Marks in the Sunday Express as a means of compelling some reasonable thinking, and equally predictably rejected by Peregrine Worsthorne in S Tel on the grounds that the Army must stay to demonstrate that lawful authority must prevail against revolutionary (not republican or unionist) violence. 2. During Fri/Sat(20/21 Oct). 
This was a relatively quiet period with SF

23rd October, 1972. The Defence Secretary has seen your Secretary of State’s 
minute of 19th October to the Prime Minister about his intention to issue a leaflet setting out very briefly the contents of the Paper for Discussion. 
Lord Carrington has no comment to make 
on the idea of such a leaflet, but he has asked me to make the following points about the draft text of it. 
First, as regards the paragraph headed "Security", we would 
like at least to see the words "maintenance of" inserted before the word "security" in the first line, in order to make it clear what this paragraph is really about. 
In addition, however, we 
feel that the final part of the paragraph would be better if it stuck to the wording of the equivalent passage in the Paper itself, at paragraph 79h. 
We therefore suggest that the paragraph in the leaflet should read as follows: 
"The Paper points out that the maintenance of security in Northern Ireland, though it primarily affects the people of Northern Ireland, must also take account of the general United Kingdom interest 
- since it may, as at present, 
involve the commitment of the armed forces, the use of emergency powers, or repercussions at international level." 
Kingdom concerns", which is of course a straight quote from paragraph 74. 
- is, I understand, a thought which was 
The second point arises from the paragraph headed "United The last of the three concerns - "that Northern 
Ireland should not offer a base for any external threat to the United Kingdom" 
incorporated into the draft of the Paper which went to Cabinet without any discussion with this Department; 
and as it was 
included in a paragraph on which we had offered no comments at the earlier stage, I am afraid we did not pick it up. 
not arguing that the point is invalid, but that there are at least two snags in focusing any attention on it: 
a. that it may invite readers to ask what particular sort 
of threat we have in mind - which we might then have some difficulty in spelling out; and 
T.C. Platt, Esq., We are

State’s minute of 19 October about the plans to produce a leaflet setting out very briefly what 
is to be found in the Northern Ireland paper for discussion. 
such a leaflet should be published. The Prime Minister would, however, like He suggests that the first 
indented paragraph should read as follows:- 
"* MUST BE ABLE TO GET THINGS DONE, to enable the houses, the schools, the factories and the jobs which Northern Ireland needs to be provided." 
The point of this amendment is that the Government cannot directly provide the jobs - others must do that. 
The Prime Minister has seen your Secretary of The Prime Minister agrees that 
to propose one amendment to the final page of the leaflet.

of major developments in Northern Ireland, and Sir John Peck will need instructions on the action to take on this occasion. 
new developments to Mr. Lynch a very short time before they happen. 
Our normal practice has been to pass information on On this occasion however security considerations are 
not significant in the same way as they were for, e.g. the start of Operation Motorman or the introduction of internment. The fact that the document is to be published is public knowledge, and the Prime Minister has been briefed to give Mr. Lynch an indication of the ground it will cover. 
circumstances it would seem reasonable to hand over a copy a reasonable time before publication. 
The latter is to be on Monday 30 October and our suggestion would be that Peck should 
give him a copy, to be kept confidential until publication, before Mr. Lynch leaves his office for the preceding weekend. He usually spends these near Cork and leaves Dublin on Friday. I should be glad of your agreement that we can give Peck discretion to deliever a copy before his departure, which would probably be Friday 27 October though circumstances might make it desirable to act on Thursday 26 October. 
that Mr. Lynch is being consulted about the matters dealt with in the discussion paper. 
We should regard it as important to avoid any suggestion On the other hand, the document is 
designedly drafted to stimulate the views of the different interests, and it would be reasonable for Peck to say to Mr. Lynch that, if he wished to put forward any views we should be glad to receive them through the diplomatic channel. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Platt and Andrew. In these

Following the meeting of GEN 79 last week the arrangements for publishing the Green Paper have gone ahead and it will be published on Monday 30 October. I intend to announce this in the House next week, possibly by means of an arranged Parliamentary Question. 
The Paper for Discussion is pretty heavy going. It is none the worse for that since we have to state accurately and carefully the various options that are open. Some people in Northern Ireland will read it but, as always, most will depend upon the press, television and on popular versions. I am arranging for maximum publicity. It seems to me,however, that we shall be justified in producing a short leaflet to set out very briefly what is to be found in the Paper for Discussion and to tell people how they can purchase copies of it. I attach a draft of such a paper. My intention is that this should be widely available free of cost throughout Northern Ireland and I hope to issue it at the same time as the Paper for Discussion is published or as soon as possible afterwards. One can never be sure what the Irish will seize upon and before issuing this leaflet I thought you and our colleagues on GEN 79 ought to see it. I also intend to produce a pamphlet which will be a shorter, and simpler, version of the Paper for Discussion but this will be done some time afterwards and will comprise mainly suitable extracts. I need not trouble you with this. 
May I take it that you will see no objection to issuing the attached leaflet? I am sending a copy of this minute to our colleagues in GEN 79 so that they can comment too. If I am to issue the leaflet at the same time as the Paper for Discussion is published, I shall need agreement to it at latest by Monday of next week.

The Future 
The GOVERNMENT has published a paper for discussion entitled THE FUTURE OF NORTHERN IRELAND, which sets out the basic points to be taken into account in deciding how best to reach a fair and just settlement of Northern Ireland’s problema. 
This leaflet provides a summary of the contents of the paper and explains how it seeks to help in the search for a solution. 
The Paper can be bought at bookshops or at any of the offices of the Ministry of Health & Social Services, price 2 0 p. 
THE PAPER * 
SETS OUT in detail how the present grave situation has arisen, 
* OUTLINES point by point the proposals of the various political parties on what they consider should be done, 
* EXPLAINS the factors which must be taken into account in working out which steps have the most promising chance of success, 
* DOES NOT offer any single, cut-and-dried plan for Northern Ireland. The Paper is intended to set out fairly all the facts and all the choices, so that there may be further discussions with those most directly concerned the people of Northern Ireland themselves. Only after this has been done will firm decisions be taken.

Thank you for your letter of 17 October about two further points on the "Paper for Discussion". I understand that officials have been in touch with each other and that as a result an agreed amendment has been inserted in paragraph 68 which meets the essence of the two points you make in your letter. 
Perhaps I could also take this opportunity of confirming that we have had from you at official level a suggested amemdment about the role of the GOC following the Downing Street declaration of 1969, and we have adopted in the "Paper for Discussion" the wording which your officials were kind enough to suggest.

18th October, 1972. I am sure that you are as worried as I am, now 
that the long dreaded and awaited Protestant backlash, how I hate the word, appears to be with us. 
but I think there are two principal ones. 
There are many reasons for this, as you will know, Firstly the 
Army has not been as efficient as it could have been in dealing with the I.R.A., for political reasons principally, the fear of antagonising the Roman Catholic population. Secondly the complete absence of respected leadership, irrespective of political influence. 
is a proven disaster, I will say no more about it. 
The first reason The 
second reason is one which can be repaired, and in my opinion must be, as it is our only hope. 
Again I recommend to 
you our Governor, a professional, extremely well liked by both sides, intelligent, knowledgeable, dedicated to do all in his limited power to help, and by virtue of the terms of his appointment almost powerless. 
He has the particular 
advantage, above all others at this time, by being a New Zealander. 
speed, to permit him to be the same sort of Governor that he was in the Bahamas. 
Surely his status can be altered, and with It only took 24 hours to 
eliminate Stormont! Surely he can gather unto himself 
a Council with and through which he can govern Northern Ireland. 
He advised by him in this. in putting this before you, many people have come to me I am also not alone

17th October 1972 After this morning’s Cabinet Lord Carrington agreed 
with Mr. Whitelaw that I should write to you putting some commentson the "Paper for Discussion". 
First of all, we were pleased to note that the revised 
draft had taken account of our suggestions on the passages concerned with responsibility for internal security, in what are now paragraphs 48 and 79(h). 
As to paragraphs 68 to 70 - the Armed Forces as a factor 
we noted that our draft of paragraph 69 was accepted in its entirety, but that paragraph 68 had been compressed in such a way as to omit two points which we regard as important. These were : 
a. that the very large build-up of our force level, as described in the third sentence, was not brought about solely by the efforts of the terrorists (whom we would not wish to flatter with such an inference) but also by our self-imposed observance of the doctrines of maximum restraint and impartiality 
- without which one 
could expect to achieve the same results with fewer troops: 
b. that there was a price to be paid for this heavy commitment, in terms of turbulence, interference with training etc and also financial cost 
- as well as in 
terms of casualties. (Even this was less specific than the original draft, which referred to the need for "the temporary withdrawal of some troops from NATO obligations.") 
We should not want either of these points which are not made in these terms anywhere else in the paper - to go by default, 
the more so since the reference to the Armed Forces in the original draft of paragraph 67 has now been excluded. I understand that an amendment which we proposed at 
official level (Stephens/Trevelyan) to paragraph 21, designed to T.C. Platt, Esq.

PRIVATE NOTICE QUESTION - TUESDAY 17th OCTOBER 1972 
Rev. Ian Paisley(Antrim, North): to ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the. ivil disturbances in Northern Ireland last night and the deaths which resulted therefrom. 
MR. WILLIAM WHITELAW Last night there were.serious disorders in some 
predominantly Protestant areas of East and West Balfast. Between 8.30 and 9 p.m., rioting broke out in East 
Belfast. About the same time, the Army controls on three of the bridges across the river Lagan checked an attempt by groups of Protestant youths, some armed with cudgels, to move across into East Belfast. Thereafter trouble in East Belfast escalated, with the hi-jacking of a bus and the building of barricades. 
At 9.50 p.m. it was learned from an anonymous 
telephone call to the Tennant Street Police Station in West Belfast that two RUC Reserve Constables had been taken hostage in that area. The Army vehicle that went to rescue them was greeted by stones, bottles and a blast bomb which was thrown towards it. Thereafter there were serious disorders in the Shankill Road area of West Belfast as well as in East Belfast. 
Between 10.15 and 10.30 pm two civilians were killed in incidents involving army vehicles. In the course of the right over 130 rounds were fired at the security forces. They fired 72 rounds in return. 
were admitted to hospital, 4 of them with gunshot wounds. 22 more soldiers were slightly injued.. 32 people were arrested. 
11 soldiers

NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NOON ON MONDAY 16 OCTOBER 1. 
Mr Woodfield reported that the Green Paper was before the Cabinet that morning, and should be published on 30 October. The names of the 3 members of the Diplock Commission (Professor Cross, Mr George Woodcock and Sir Kenneth Younger) would be announced very shortly. 
2. Local Government Elections 
The Secretary of State’s view was that it was too soon to decide whether to postpone the Local Government elections. A paper on this problem was being prepared in Belfast. 
3. Gusty Spence 
The Chief Constable had ordered an enquiry into the arrest of the UVF leaders and the reported release of Gusty Spence. Meanwhile it was imperative that nothing should be said which could indicate any disagreement between the Army and the Police on the events of that night. 
4. IRA Futnerals 
It is army policy to prevent the IRA from firing shots over coffins at funerals, but the problem is to prevent them from staging a quick operation for publicity purposes. This had occurred at the IRA funeral reported recently with photographs, in the press. The guns had been visible for a matter of seconds only, and then hiden and hurried away. 
5. 6. Mr O’Malley 
Mr O’Malley’s recent article in the "Times" about the Republic’s success on border control had evoked no interest from news media in the UK. 
Strasbourg 
FCO, MOD, Attorney-General’s Departments and NIO would shortly meet to discuss the way forward on the Strasbourg hearings. 
7. Special Powers Act 
The Army in Northern Ireland would continue to take a calculated risk on whether or not they exceeded their powers (under Section 7) by stopping and searching. 
8. New "Plastic Bullet" 
Brigade Commanders in Northern Ireland had been authorised to introduce at will a new "plastic bullet" (45 grade PVC).

" but a "paper for discussion". (ii)

9th October, 1972 I am writing to let you know that the Defence Secretary, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, has approved the use by the Army in Northern Ireland of a new type of CS Bursting Grenade. 
Until now the standard means of dispensing CS have been the 
CS Grenade and the CS Cartridge. But their value in operation has been limited; for example, rioters have learned to avoid their plume of CS by moving to windward, or to smother them with a bucket, or even to kick them back at the troops. 
In an attempt to overcome these problems, approval was given 
in December 1970, for the development of a bursting grenade designed to burst open on the ground and scatter 400 smouldering pellets which gave off CS. The operational instructions which were prepared for this grenade took into account certain new hazards which it presented; its explosion, although small, scattered debris which could cause minor lacerations at short range and its smouldering pellets could cause small local burns if they lodged in the eye or became caught between clothing and skin. 
Unfortunately, the bursting grenade proved unreliable in full 
production and, as a result, only very limited quantities have been sent to the troops in Northern Ireland. It has been used operationally only twice 
- in July and September 1971 in Londonderry. In 
the meantime, further research has led to the development of a new type of bursting grenade which holds promise of reliability while achieving the aims of the earlier version, and is considerably safer. 
The new Grenades are designed to burst open in the air about - each about 38mm in length, 15mm in diameter 
30 ft above rioters’ heads and to scatter 23 "mini-canisters" of CS. These "mini-canisters" 
and 8 grams in weight - are scattered over a radius of about 15 m, 
providing a quick and even concentration of CS which cannot easily be avoided or nullified.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR TILE PERIOD 060700 HOURS TO 090700 HOURS OCTOBER 1972 
1. The weekends violence followed the usual pattern of a more active 
Friday with quieter Saturday and Sunday. However there were less shooting incidents (77) than in recent weekends (130 last weekend). On the other hand there were 12 bombings compared with 7 last weekend causing 1 civilian killed and 16 injured. Another bomb in the Lower Falls had the appearance of a Protestant attack. Several useful arrests were made and there were 6 hits on terrorists (including 1 killed).

2. During Fri/Sat (6/7 Oct). There was an increase in shooting incidents (35) in Belfast and one gunman was shot dead. There were no SF casualties but 2 other hits were claimed. An explosion caused extensive damage to a Youth Club in Mullhouse St (Falls). A number of arrests were made including 2 officers and 4 volunteers of the Provisional IRA. Londonderry was extremely quiet; there were no shooting incidents and only sporadic stoning in the Shantallow area. A 150 lb bomb caused extensive damage in Ballymena. A UDR soldier was abducted in Newry and in 3 separate incidents, other UDR soldiers were robbed of a total of 3 rifles, a shotgun, an SMG and ammunition, a 9mm pistol and an air rifle. UDA members were active in Lurgan and Lisburn.

NOTE OF A MEETING AT NOON ON 6 OCTOBER 1972 1. The Chairman reported the general conclusions reached by Ministers that morn- 
ing on the timing of possible political developments and other matters, and said that work in the Northern Ireland Office on the setting up of tribunals and the Diplock Commission was proceeding urgently. 
2. The meeting discussed the possibility that the Sunday Times insight team might 
publish an article on the use of patrols in plain clothes by the Army. The informtion services have been working hard on countering IRA propaganda about "assassination squads" by making the facts available to the press. The line should be taken that it is natural and essential for the security forces to have recourse to patrols in plain clothes. If an unreasonable article didappear this Sunday, it was possible that a reply might be delivered in a major speech. 
3. Although there has been little change in the security situation, two dangers 
in particular remain: that Provisionals who have been in the Republic will step up their activity in Northern Ireland; and that Protestant extremists will grow in strength. Any information about the Provisionals in the Republic which could be passed to the authorities there for action should be sent to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 
4. The next meetings are due to take place at noon on 10 and 13 October in Conference Room B.

Northern Ireland Two memoranda by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland are 
to be considered by Ministers at the meeting of GEN 79 tomorrow. The first is GEN 79(72) 23, a Note by the Secretary of State covering four memoranda by Northern Ireland officials on future developments; the second is GEN 79(72) 24, a Note by the Secretary of State reporting on the present state of play and suggesting a timetable of work for the next few months. 2. 
The second memorandum is the more urgent in terms of the need 
for decisions; and the Committee should therefore tackle it first. The main points on which the Secretary of State seeks agreement are as follows:(a) He suggests that the amendment of Regulation 24A, which would strengthen our hand in charging leading terrorists in the open courts, should not be made at present; that the matter should be referred to Lord Diplock’s Commission; and that, in the meantime, the establishment of the new Tribunals should suffice to enable us to deal with these individuals. The reasons in favour of this change of plan are deployed in paragraph 4; and the Secretary of State is probably on strong ground in arguing that the amendment of Regulation 24A would be likely to have a more favourable hearing in the House if it has the prior backing of the Diplock Commission. (b) 
It is proposed that the Green Paper should go rather further than a 
bare description of possible options for the future and should indicate the general direction in which we intend to move, not by committing us at this stage to any precise constitutional development but by indicating certain constitutional features which would not be acceptable. The question arises 
- how far should we go in this direction in the Green Paper? 
Ministers may wish to defer a decision on this point until a text is available; but the discussion on the second memorandum before them (on which see below) may throw some light on it. (c) Mr. Whitelaw wishes to publish the Green Paper by the end of October (paragraph 7(b)). 
next week, the European Summit the week after and the Opening of In view of the Conservative Party Conference

world were making the same sort of mistakes now that Europe had made over the last centuries. The Prime Minister thought that British entry into Europe 
would contribute to the removal of the difficulties which had bedevilled relations between the United Kingdom and Ireland for so long. We in the United Kingdom had lost a chance, thanks to President de Gaulle,.of entering Europe in 1962, and if we had entered then it was possible that the troubles which we had since experienced in our relations with the Irish might never have taken place, or would have been much alleviated. 
He hoped that the common membership of the 
European Community would be helpful to relations between the United Kingdom ad Ireland, and would also assist the latter in raising her standard of living to the level of other countries in Western Europe; this would in itself help to reduce the significance of the Border. Meanwhile there were serious problems facing the United 
Kingdom in Northern Ireland, particularly the questions of violence and constitutional reform. 
He conceded that there 
had been grievances in the past and he had finally decided to introduce direct rule, in order to try and remove these once and for all. 
It has been a difficult decision to take; 
William Pitt was the last Prime Minister to do this at the end of the 18th century and it had been no easier then. 
He 
pointed out that the United Kingdom had already carried out substantial reforms in Northern Ireland and intended to

NOTE OF A THE COMMISSION 1. There will be a maximum of 5 members. Lord Diplock has accepted the post of 
Chairman and it is hoped to nominate the other members soon. THE TRIBUNAL 2. 
GEN 79 3. 
MEETING AT NOON ON 3 OCTOBER Legislation to set up Tribunals is at present being drafted. Two papers concerning Northern Ireland will go to Gen 79 on Friday. The first 
by the Secretary of State deals with progress on the Green Paper and puts forward a tentative timetable for action in the next 3-6 months. 4. 
The second has been written by a Committee of Permanent Secretaries from the 
Northern Ireland Civil Service, and discusses possible future constitutional arrangements. IRISH STAT CASE AT STRASBOURG 3. 
Some of the allegations by the Irish Government concerning Britain’s actions 
in Northern Ireland have been ruled admissible by the European Commission on Human Rights. It is possible however, that the Irish Government might drop the case brfore the allegations themselves are heard. Further action should wait until the constitutional proposals for Northern Ireland are more firmly settled. 6. 
The Attorney General has written to the NIO and the FCO, saying that not 
enough was made of our success in having some of the charges withdrawn. The FCO will reply. OPERATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE 7. 
The Official IRA’s threat to call off the ceasefire was probably made to take 
advantage of the publicity gained thereby. It seems they are more worried about the inter-factional struggle between themselves and the Provisionals and the statement was probably made in an attempt to reassert their influence over events in Northern Ireland.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 290700HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 to 020700 HOURS OCTOBER 1972

Most of the trouble was in Belfast with Londonderry and the Rural areas relatively quiet. The major violence was in the Lower Falls area which continued throughout Friday afternoon and evening and seems to have been started by Provisional action against the Officials; -this being a predominately Official area. The bombing of a Catholic club, perhaps by Provisionals, and a funeral procession were the main cause and apportunity for the serious violence between the factions and against Security Forces. 
This 
developed on Saturday into attacks on Security Force posts mainly in the Falls, but died away during the late evening with Sunday being mainly quiet. Meanwhile the Vanguard rally passed off ithout violence. RUC estimates of the attendance were 15000 including a parade of UDA members some wearing masks and carrying cudgels.

NOTE OF A MEETING AT NOON ON 29 SEPTEMBER 
THE CONFERENCE 1. 
A brief report on the Conference was given. It was useful in so far as it 
clarified the areas of agreement and dissension among the three political parties whose representatives attended. All agreed there should be some form of regional assembly, but were against complete integration with the United Kingdom or the condominium solution. The Alliance and Northern Ireland Labour Parties were in favour of the diffision. of power as between the majority and minority communities, but the Unionist proposals would continue to concentrate power in the hands of the majority party. 2. 
Mr Whitelaw’s statement at the end of the conference pointed out that any 
settlement that was reached would have to take account of the interests of the UK. We had not only a large commitment in terms of money and troops, but also had to take account of internal and external security factors both for Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom as a whole. THE SECURITY SITUATION 3. 
A report was given on the measures taken so far on setting up the commission 
and the tribunal. 4. 
Although the level of force reductions would be borne in mind when setting the 
date of the local elections, nothing could be decided at this stage as it depended on when the necessary legislation went through Parliament. FUTURE ACTION 5. 
A progress report would be given to GEN 79 on the content and timing of pub- 
lication of a Green Paper on proposals made at the Conference; and on the new interim measures for security.

NORTHERN IRELAND (BORDER POLL) BILL SECOND READING SPEECH 
I beg to move, that the Bill be now read a second time. 
This Bill comes before the House in fulfilment of a promise to the people of Northern Ireland. That promise was made when the Parliament of Northern Ireland was prorogued in March this year. The House will know that. Her Majesty’s Government included a proposal for periodic plebiscites in the measures which were discussed with the Northern Ireland Government shortly before the Northern Ireland Parliament was prorogued.

October 30, 1972. The Governments objective in Northern Ireland is to deliver its people 
from the violence and fear in which they live today and to bring about a peaceful future, states Mr. William Whitelaw, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in a foreword to a Discussion Paper on Northern Ireland which is made public today*. The Discussion Paper does not set out any single scheme for the future of the Province but defines some of the fundamental conditions which must be met by any settlement. The purpose of the Paper, Mr. Whitelaw says, is to place the Northern 
Ireland situation "in the wider context of certain unalterable facts of life 
- political, economic and military - which must fundamentally influence 
any settlement. This Paper is intended to provide a comprehensive basis for further discussions which I now propose immediately to put in hand. These must go ahead with the utmost urgency. What is at issue is the future of Northern Ireland The main body of the Paper is in four parts. Part One deals with the 
historical background to the present situation, summarising the events of the years between the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and the Northern

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 270700 HRS TO 300700 HRS OCTOBER 1972 GENERAL 1. 
The level of violence was low. On Fri/Sat there were 31 shooting 
incidents (16 involving SF) and nil explosions; on Sat/Sun 22 (13) and one; and on Sun/Mon 17 (12) and 2, making a total over the three days of 70 shooting incidents (41 involving SF) and only 3 explosions. Casualties included one L/Sgt of 2 SG killed by a sniper in Londonderry and 2 other soldiers, one of them UDR, slightly wounded; two terrorists claimed hit (one in Belfast and one in Armagh, both on Saturday); and one civilian killed (a 16 year old RC shot on Sunday from a passing car in Cliftonville, Belfast, a mixed area) and six wounded. There were no major incidents over the weekend and nine marches in Belfast on Sunday were held without any trouble. About 1800 orangemen attended seven of the marches and the other two were by PD (1000) and NICRA (300), themes not known. James Strutt (31), UVF serving 6 years for armed robbery, escaped on Friday from the Crulin Road Jail. In the Republic, seven IRA Provos, four of them reportedly from Ulster, names not yet known, escaped from the Curragh military prison by tunneling. UVF are being blamed for causing small fires in four Dublin hotels, and for planting a bomb (defused by Irish ATO) at the railway station in Dublin serving Belfast. The Provisional Sein Fein AGM was held in Dublin on Sat/ Sun. There were reportedly 1000 delegates, 200 of them from Ulster. Rory O’Brady was unanimously reelected President. He apparently stressed the Provisional plan for a United Socialist Irish Republic based on regional government for the four anicent Irish Kingdoms. John Stephenson reportedly urged parallel political /military action. If there was a theme, it could be said to be a new emphasis on political action through local issues, north and south. In GB, weekend press comment almost universally welcomed the postponement of the local government elections. Other comment was largely devoted to speculation about the contents and likely effect of the publication of HMG’s paper for discussion

NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NOON ON FRIDAY 27 OCTOBER 1. 
Local Government Elections 
A copy of the press announcement about the postponement of Local Government Elections is attached. Postponement until "the Spring" ould leave the date open for the period March-May, ie before or after Easter. 
2. Green Paper 
The arrangements for the release of the Green Paper to the press at noon on Monday, and to certain individuals over the weekend, were discussed. 
3. White Paper 
A tentative estimate for the publication of the White Paper was 15 February15 larch. It was noted that there could be additional risks to security at that time if Protestant extremists decided to oppose the Governments proposals, 
4. 
Plebiscite The Bill is expected to be laid on 1 November and published next day. 
5. Tribunals 
The Order-in-Council will go to the Privy Council on 1 November, and be laid on 6 November. Security arrangements for the hearings by the Tribunal were discussed. The review of internment orders and detention orders would probably take place at Long Kesh. 
6. Bail 
The granting of bail in Magistrates’ Courts was further discussed. Summing up, Sir William Nield said that 3 possible courses of action should be followed up: 
(i) (ii) 
The appearance in Court of persons charged (eg with offences connected with rioting) could be postponed 24 hours. 
The presentation of cases in which bail was opposed could be improved by the Police, notably by using lawyers skilled in this type of work. 
7. 
(iii) The procedure for guidance to Magistrates should be explored further. Diplock Commission 
The possibility had to be faced that the Commission might report that there was no effective alternative to internment. In case this should happen, 
it was all the more important that the Tribunals should be seen to be operating fairly and effectively.

27 October 1972 POSTPONEMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS 
The secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr William Whitelaw, has today decided to postpone the Northern Ireland Local Government Elections until the spring. The new date will be determined after consulting the political parties. The decision to postpone the local elections will require an Order of the Westminster Parliament. 
The date of December 6 for the local elections was carefully chosen because it was the last convenient date if the new local authorities were to function properly from April 1 1973 - the date set in the original scheme. 
However, the Secretary of State has rcceved very strong representations from political parties and many other responsible organisations for a postponement of the date for polling from December 6. Postponement would enable the local elections to be held at a more normal and convenient time of the year; on a more up-to-date electoral register which is a considerable advantage; and after the border plebiscite, so that the local elections could more easily focus on truly local issues. 
Postponement of the local elections involves deferring the introduction of the reshaped local government system, of which the new district councils and the new administrative arrangemnts for education, health and personal social services, roads planning and other major regional services are integral parts. The effective date for the reorganisation will therefore be moved back from April 1 to October 1 1973. Preparations will go ahead for the new scheme to start then. 
The existing authorities will be asked to carry n for a further period of cix months. The Secretary of State is confident that he can rely on their help and co-operation in maintaining services at their present high level. He will be consulting them and will afford them every possible assistance in doing so.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE NEW ULSTER MOVEMENT AT STORMONT CASTLE ON TUESDAY, 24 OCTOBER 1972 
Present: The Secretary of State 
Mr Brian W Walker MrBrian McK McGuigan Mr C Hull Mr H Stevenson Dr John Whyte 
Mr Whalley 
The Secretary of State saw a deputation from the New Ulster Movement on 24 October. The deputation raised the following points in discussion: 
They were grateful to the Prime Minister for the work he had done in securing EEC regional policy. 
1. The Secretary of State said 
that he would pass on this comment. 2. 
Between the publication of the White Paper and the holding of 
the referendum there should be a strong campaign (if necessary involving the Prime Minister) to spell out to the Northern Ireland people the choice facing them between the maintenance of the British link on British terms and an independent Northern Ireland. It was in any case important to spell out the Government’s views strongly. There had been expressions of strong opinion on a UTV broadcast at 11 00 am on 22 October that the Protestant community should seek a solution on its own terms. This line of thought should be vigorously countered. 
3. It was important to preserve the support of the Labour Party. 
One way of doing this would be to have a senior member of the Labour Party either as a Minister or as an adviser to the Government at Stormont Castle. The Secretary of State said that he believed the Labour Party were being involved as much as possible at present, although he would see what more could be done. He believed that it was important to carry through the legislative proposals with as much support from the Labour and Liberal Parties as possible. 
4. The Green Paper should be distributed to every household. The

CONFIDENTIAL 1972 TO FLASH DUBLIN TELNO 229 OF 26 OCT INFO PRIORITY UKREP BELFAST 
M.I.P.T.: POSTPONEMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND LOCAL ELECTIONS. 1. FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF ANNOUNCEMENT. 
1. THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS TODAY DECIDED TO POSTPONE THE NORTHERN IRELAND LOCAL GOVERNEMENT ELECTIONS UNTIL THE SPRING. THE NEW DATE WILL BE DETERMINED IN CONSULTATION WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES. THE DECISION TO POSTPONE THE LOCAL ELECTIONS WILL REQUIRE AN ORDER OF THE WESTMINISTER PARLIAMENT. 2. THE DATE OF 6TH DECEMBER FOR THE LOCAL ELECTIONS WAS CAREFULLY CHOSEN BECAUSE IT WAS THE LAST CONVENIENT DATE IF THE NEW LOCAL AUTHORITIES WERE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY FROM THE DATE SET IN THE ORIGINAL SCHEME OF 1ST APRIL 1973. 3. HOWEVER, THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS RECEIVED VERY STROG REPRESENTATIONS FROM POLITICAL PARTIES AND MANY OTHER RESPONSIBLE ORGANISATIONS THAT 6TH DECEMBER WOULD BE A VERY UNSATISFACTORY DATE FOR POLLING. POSTPONEMENT ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD ENABLE THE LOCAL ELECTIONS TO BE HELD AT A MORE NORMAL AND CONVENIENT TIME OF THE YEAR: ON A MORE UP TO DATE ELECTORAL REGISTER WHICH IS A CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE: AND AFTER THE BORDER PLEBISCITE, SO THAT THE LOCAL ELECTIONS COULD MORE EASILY FOCUS ON TRULY LOCAL ISSUES. 4. POSTPONEMENT OF THE LOCAL ELECTIONS INVOLVES DEFERRING THE INTRODUCTION OF THE REFORMED LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM, OF WHICH THE NEW DISTRICT COUNCILS AND THE AGENCIES FOR EDUCATION, HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES, ROADS, PLANNING AND OTHER MAJOR REGIONAL SERVICES ARE INTEGRAL PARTS. THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR THE REORGANISATION WILL THEREFORE BE MOVED BACK FROM ST APRIL TO 1ST OCTOBER 1973. PREPARATIONS WILL GO AHEAD FOR THE NEW SCHEME TO START THEN. 5. THE EXISTING AUTHORITIES WILL BE ASKED TO CARRY ON FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS. THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS CONFIDENT THAT HE CAN RELY ON THEIR HELP AND CO-OPERATION IN MAINTAINING SERVICES AT THEIR PRESENT HIGH LEVEL. HE WILL BE CONSULTING THEM AND WILL AFFORD THEM EVERY POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE IN DOING SO.

NOTE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE’S MORNING MEETING AT 10.00AM ON WEDNESDAY 18 OCTOBER IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE’S OFFICE, GREAT GEORGE STREET 
Present: 
Secretary of State Lord Windlesham Mr Channon Mr Raison Mr Woodfield Mr Trevelyan Mr Lewin Mr Seaman Mr Perkins 
The main points discussed at this morning’s meeting were as follows: SECURITY SITUATION 
There had been a meeting the night before with members of the UDA. The meeting had lasted 21/2 hours and had consisted of the UDA complaining about the British Army, no reference being made to politics. 
During the night the level of rioting had fallen but the number any of three views on the current situation: 
a. the UDA leaders wanted to calm the situation but had been unable to call off the gun man in time; 
b. the UDA leadership had lost control of the rank and file members; and 
c. the UDA efforts to calm the situation were a pretence. They would incite more violence in the near future to prove that they were the people in control. 
It would be possible for the Secretary of State to make a statement on the situation on either radio or television but be felt that as the British Press was generally in support of his action he should put off doing so until next week. It was considered that it would be better if we could guide the television interviewers etc towards some of the more moderate elements and it was agreed that Mr Seaman should speak to Mr McDowall with a view to arranging this. Mr Seaman was also asked to keep a close watch on events
