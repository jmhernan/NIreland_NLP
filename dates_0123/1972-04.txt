NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 117 13 
APRIL 1972 
Incidents during the past 24 hours The Province was again comparatively quiet. A woman was 
however killed when a 50 - 100 lb bomb exploded in a stolen van 
parked outside a drapers shop at Ballymoney in the north of County Antrim. An anonymous telephone call had warned of the bomb shortly before midnight. There was however insufficient time to evacuate the area completely before the bomb went off and a woman in a flat above the shop died in the resulting fire. 2. 
There were three other explosions in rural areas. At Kilrea 
a bomb exploded in a car belonging to a RUC constable, wrecking the car but causing no casualties and at Killea (near Londonderry) the Customs caravan was blown up. At Newtownbutler, Co. Fermanagh a telephone exchange was extensively damaged by a 10 lb bomb. 3. 
The bomb located in the dry cleaners in Londonderry on Tuesday 
(Situation Report No. 116 refers) was exploded by Army bomb disposal experts. There were no casualties. 4. 
There were nine shooting incidents in Belfast and troops returned 
fire on three occasions. It is believed that one gunman was hit. In Londonderry terrorists fired at security forces four times. Fire was returned twice and one hit was claimed. There were two shooting incidents in the rural areas when gunmen ambushed troops close to the border near Londonderry. Fire was returned on both occasions. There were no casualties but an Army landrover was hit twice. 5. 
There were three instances of hooligan activity in Belfast all 
involving children. Five baton rounds were fired at children stoning a patrol in Andersonstown and two children were later treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital for minor injuries. Protestant and Catholic children stoned each other in the Shankill Road/Springfield Road

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 116 12 APRIL 1972 
Incidents during the past 24 hours It was a comparatively quiet day throughout the Province. There were 12 shooting incidents - five in Belfast and seven in 
Londonderry. Troops either returned fire or took the initiative in firing at gunmen on seven occasions but there were no casualties on either side. 2. 
There were three minor bomb attacks in Belfast and two in 
Londonderry. In one of the incidents in Londonderry two youths walked into a dry cleaners and placed a device near the counter. They told the Manageress it was a bomb, appeared to adjust it and then walked out. The Army’s first reaction was that the bomb was a hoax. During the evening, however, Mr. Hume MP, Mr. Cassidy (Daily Journal reporter) and Mr. Barrow (RTE) were all phoned up by a man who advised them that the bomb was real. Bomb disposal experts were called in and the area was evacuated during the night. It is not yet known whether the bomb is a hoax or not. In the other incident in Londonderry superficial damage was done to a hut at Duncreggan TAVR centre by a 2/3 lb bomb which was thrown over the fence. There was one bomb incident in the rural areas when a bomb exploded causing minor damage to a food store in Benburb (between Dungannon and Armagh). 3. 
Soldiers were called by the RUC to a disturbance at the home 
of the parents of Mrs. McGuikan (who had been painted and feathered on Sunday). The crowd dispersed when the patrol arrived. There were two intersectarian stoning incidents in Belfast and a soldier of the 2 Royal Irish on leave was beaten up. There was the usual hooliganism in Londonderry though at a lower level than normal. 4. 
A Vanguard meeting was held at Windsor Park, Belfast at which Mr. Craig and Rev. Herne spoke. About 400 attended.

Note of a meeting at 11 a.m. on 11 April 1972 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 1. 
The Army is continuing to adopt a ’lower profile’: patrols in sensitive 
areas are being restricted, and arrests being made only of key terrorists, or in hot pursuit or on the basis of reliable intelligence. But discreet watch is being kept on areas where inter-sectarian clashes are possible. 2. 
posts, as a result of which more serious disturbances have broken out. The Northern Ireland Office is arranging for ways of dealing with this to be considered in Northern Ireland. 3. 
There have been occasions when children leaving school have attacked Army The Army is experiencing no hindrance in its patrolling of Protestant areas. 
Only in the Roman Catholic Creggan and Bogside areas of Londonderry would very large patrols be required if, for example, a simple arrest operation were to be carried out 
Any criticism that these are ’no-go’ areas will be met by 
stressing the hope that the political measures being taken by the Government will so reduce tension that talks may begin and normal conditions return. INTELLIGENCE 4. 
The Director of Intelligence has estimated that while the strength of the 
two wings of the IRA has not altered recently in Northern Ireland as a whole, they have doubled their strength in Londonderry. Aerial reconnaissance has shown a system of trenches and permanent barricades in the Creggan and Bogside areas. 5. 
It now seems possible that in spite of earlier signs to the contrary some 
public sympathy in Roman Catholic areas is drifting back in favour of the Provisional IRA, who are showing signs of regaining the initiative in public relations.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 115 11 APRIL 1972 
Incidents during the past 24 hours The Province generally was fairly quiet, tho h two soldiers 
of the 5 Light Regiment RA were killed in Londonderry when a bomb exploded near Rosemount RUC Station. Telephone warnings had been given that a bomb was in a pavilion near Brooke Park. A bomb disposal unit was summoned but before they arrived the bomb had exploded killing 2 NCOs who had been engaged in keeping youths away from the pavilion. The Official IRA have claimed responsibility. 2. 
There were three other bomb attacks in the Province. Two 
were small explosions in rural areas, one at the old railway station, Omagh, which caused no damage and no casualties, and the other at a farm three miles south of Armagh which caused slight damage. In Belfast a nail bomb was thrown at a wine shop in East Belfast. The shop is in a Protestant area but is owned by a Catholic who has been threatened before. 3. 
There were fourteen shooting incidents, six in Belfast and 
eight in Londonderry. Troops returned fire four times in Belfast and it is believed two gunmen were hit. There were no shooting incidents in rural areas. 4.

11 April, 1972 You wrote to John Graham on 29 March enclosing a 
copy of a secret message from Mr. Lynch to the Prime Minister and said that you thought the Prime Minister would wish to send a more than merely formal reply. You also asked for advice on how the Prime Minister might handle the relationship with the Irish Government in the coming weeks. 
Since then you will have seen the exchange of 
telegrams with Sir J. Peck, which set out not only the main points which the Prime Minister himself had raised, but also some other points we had in mind. 
The text has been approved by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. 
the attached draft is, I hope, self-explanatory, It is based on the belief that the IRA’s 
grip on the minority has not been sufficiently loosened; that the brighter future, which we hope will materialise, is not certain to do so; and that firm action against the IRA is necessary if the opportunity given by the initiative is not to be missed. 
The draft concludes by making 
specific suggestions about how co-operation between the Garda and the Security Forces could be improved. 
to Leonard Davies (Northern Ireland Department) and to Robert Andrew (MOD). 
I am sending copies of this letter and its enclosure The ideas contained in the draft 
to Mr. Lynch have been discussed with officials in those Departments, but have not yet I understand been seen by their Ministers.

NORTHER I R ELAND: C URRENT SITUATION REP ORT NO l14 10 APRIL 1972 
Incidents in the last 72 hours There was a noticeable increase in terrorist activity through- 
out the Province from the comparative quiet of the previous aster weekend. Over the three days there were 43 shooting incidents, 14 bomb explosions and 14 armed robberies as well as several incidents of minor intersectarian violence. There were five ’wanted’ arrests over the weekend. 2. 
In a shooting incident in Belfast on Friday a Lance Corporal 
Sine. of the King’s Own Scottish Borderers was killed by sniper fire outside the Henry Taggert Memorial Hall in Ballymurphy. He had left the Hall to attempt to break up a fight between two bus conductors. It is not thought however that the bus conductors were connected with the murderer. During exchanges of fire in Londonderry three gunmen are believed to have been hit on Friday and one on Saturday. One gunman is also believed to have been hit by the security forces in a shooting incident in Belfast on Sunday. 3. 
There were five shooting incidents in rural areas over the 
weekend. On Saturday a patrol was fired on by terrorists from across the border near Rosslea; there were no casualties and fire was not returned. A UDR private in uniform was also fired at on the Pomeroy/Dungannon road on Saturday: he was unharmed but there were four hits on the car. On Sunday a military landrover was damaged by a mine near Crossmaglen: wires were seen leading across the border from the mine. There were no military casualties. One shot was fired at a man seen running away from the area of the mine. 4. 
There were nine bomb explosions in Belfast and three in 
Londonderry. None of them were of major proportions. Three men were killed in Belfast on Friday when a bomb exploded while, it is

1. THIS PROJECT IS BOUND UP WITH CURRENT IRISH THINKING ON THE SUBJECT OF IRISH UNITY, WHICH IS A POLICY AIM UNDERLYING THE IRISH ATTITUDE TO EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE NORTH. THE SUSPENSION OF STORMONT, AID THE DEMANDS OF THE PROVISONAL IRA HAVE BROUGHT THE ISSUE FURTHER OUT INTO THE LIGHT. LADEN WITH EMOTION AS THE SUBJECT IS, THERE IS A BODY OF OPINION IN DUBLIN WHOSE APPROACH TO UNIFICATION IS SO MODERATE AND INTENDED TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE THAT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF IT. MOREOVER I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT IDEAS ALONG THESE LINES ARE BEING FED TO MR LYnCH WHO IS SAID TO FIND THEM BROADLY ACCEPTABLE, AND THEY ARE THEREFORE THE LIKELY CONTEXT IN WHICH SUGGESTIONS FOR ANECONOMIC COUNCIL WOULD BE CONSIDERED. THE FORM IN WHICH IT REACHED ME IS BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS. IT COMPRISES 8 POINTS. 
2. 1. THERE IS N0 DESIRE TO COMPLCATE THE PRESENT SITUATION 
BY A PUBLIC CLAIM TO EARLY REUNIFICATION, WHICH IS NEITHER EXPECTED NOR DESIRED, BUT RECOGNITION BY HMG OF THE ULTIMATE POSSIBILITY IS AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT IN SOLVING THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM. NEGATIVELY, THE ESSENTIAL IS THAT HMG SHOULD DO NOTHING TO INTEGRATE NORTHERN URELAND IN THE UK, WHICH WOULD GIVE THE IRA A CAUSE WITH GENERAL POPULAR BACKING AND CREATE A SITUATION FAR WORSE THAN EXISTED BEFORE THE SUSPENSION OF STORMONT. II. 
WESTMINSTER WOULD RETAIN THE ULTIMATE RESPONBILITY 
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND FOR A PERIOD WHICH, THOUGH UNSPECFIED WOULD BE TACITLY UNDERSTOOD TO BE SOME TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS. III. 
DURING THIS PERIOD THE NORTHERN IRISH WOULD REMAIN 
BRITISH BUT ANYONE WHO QUALIFIED FOR IRISH NATIONALITY UNDER THE EXISTING LAWS OF THE REPUBLIC WOULD CONTINUE TO BE FREE TO CLAIM IT.

ACTION AGAINST THE IRA. WHEN THE DAIL REASSEMBLES THIS WEEK, TDS WILL RETURN 
PRIMED WITH THE FEELiNGS OF THE I R CONSTITUENTS ABOUT DIRECT RULE AND HMGS ACTIONS SINCE. WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT PUBLIC SENTIMENT IS NOW OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOUR OF PEACE AND AGAINST THE PROMOTERS OF VIOLENCE. THIS WILL FORTIFY THE TAOISEACH AND MINISTER OF JUSTICE IN THEIR INTENTION, WHICH WE KNOW THEY POSSESS, TO ACT AGAINST ANYONE INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES WITH GUNS, EXPLOSIVES, SUBVERSION ETC, AS VIGOROUSLY AS THE LAW PERMITS. THERE SHOULD ALSO BE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF JUDGES AND JURIES CONVICTING. 
2. NEVERTHELESS, THE IRAS MAY CONTINUE TO KEEP WITHIN THE LAW: 
AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT, WITH THE HOPE OF SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE NORTH AND IN VIEW OF HIS BELIEF THAT THE IRA CAN BE INDUCED TO ’’WITHER AWAY’’, MR LYNCH WILL CONSIDER IT NECESSARY OR DOMESTICALLY POSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE MILITARY COURTS OR INTERNMENT. 
AS WE 
HAVE SAID BEFORE, WE BELIEVE MR LYNCH REGARDS THE IRA IN THE SOUTH PRIMARILY, AND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY, AS AN INTERNAL PROBLEM FOR HIMSELF: HE WILL NOT TAKE DRASTIC ACTION UNLESS HE BELIEVES IT TO BE INESCAPABLE FOR DOMESTIC POLITICAL REASONS. 3. 
INCREASED SECURITY ACTIVITIES NEAR THE BORDER HAVE BECOME 
POSSIBLE BECAUSE MOST IRISH NOW APPEAR TO BE WILLING TO PUT SOME CONFIDENCE IN HMGS INTENTIONS TO MAKE A JUST SETTLEMENT IN THE NORTH, AND BELIEVE THAT THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF VIOLENT CRIMES IS CONTRARY TO THEIR WISHES AND INTERESTS. 
I 
DOUBT WHETHER THE EXISTING LAWS WILL BE CHANGED, AND WE SHALL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO HAVE A NUMBER, DECREASING ONE HOPES, OF EXASPERATING VERDICTS AND SIGNS OF POLICE INEPTITUDE. THE /LEADE

APRIL 1972. 
YOUR TELNO 108. 1. MY ANSWERS TO YOUR SPECIFIC POINTS ARE AS FOLLOWS. A. 
MR LYNCH UNDERSTANDS OUR NEED TO PROCEED VERY CAUTIOUSLY AND IS NOT PRESSING FOR AN EARLY MEETING. 
HE IS MORE CONCERNED 
TO ENSURE THAT WHEN IT TAKES PLACE IT IS CAREFULLY PREPARED AND COVERS ALL THE BASIC ISSUES INVOLVED. FOR THE PRESENT IT WOULD SUFFICE TO SAY THAT THE PRIME MINISTER LOOKS FORWARD TO A FULL DISCUSSION WITH THE TAOISEACH, THAT IT WOULD BE INADVISABLE IN HIS VIEW TO MAKE SUCH A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC MOVE AT THE MOMENT, AND IN THE MEANTIME HE WOULD LIKE TO MAINTAIN REGULAR CONTACT THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS. B. 
PLEBISCITES. MR LYNCH IS BOUND TO JIB AT THESE, ON THE 
CUSTOMARY GROUNDS THAT A SIX-COUNTY UNIT FOR A VOTE IS A FAKE, AND THE ELECTORATE FOR THE PURPOSE SHOULD BE EITHER THE 32 COUNTIES OR THE WHOLE UK, APART FROM THE PRACTICAL ISSUES ABOUT VIOLENCE, POLARISATION, ETC. HE ALSO FEARS THAT THE PRO-UNITY VOTE WILL BE SMALL. I THINK HE WOULD NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE FIRST ONE IF WE COULD REASSRE HIM ABOUT THE TIME WE SEE ELAPSING BEFORE THE SECOND, AND IF WE FELT ABLE AT SOME POINT TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF THE QUESTION OR QUESTIONS PUT BEFORE THE ELECTORATE. C. ALL-PARTY TALKS. 
I DO NOT THINK THAT THE EXACT MEANING OF 
THIS PHRASE NEED BE RAISED OR DISCUSSED AT PRESENT. MR LYNCH HAS SET UP AN ALL-PARTY COMMITTEE IN DUBLIN, AND HIS CONTACTS WITH THE SDLP ARE CLOSE. HE PRESSED THEM VERY HARD INDEED TO RESPOND WELL TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF DIRECT RULE. ALTHOUGH THE IRISH GOVERNMENT ARE FURIOUS WITH MR WILSON FOR SEEING IRA LEADERS THEY WILL NO DOUBT MAINTAIN CONTACTS WITH THE WESTMINSTER OPPOSITION. USING ’’PARTY’’ IN ITS NON-POLITICAL SENSE, MR LYNCH WILL BE SATISFIED IF HE CAN FEEL THAT HE IS MAINTAINING A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH HMG, AND CAN VAGUELY AND WITHOUT ALARMING THE UNIONISTS INDICATE IN THE DAIL THAT THIS IS SO. 
2. I THINK HOWEVER THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR INFORMAL DIRECT 
CONTACTS TO BE ESTABLISHED AT AN EARLY DATE WITH MINISTERIAL AND/OR OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVES OF MR WHITELAW IN DUBLIN. THIS COULD BE INITIALLY PRIVATE AND SOCIAL, THE MAIN AIM BEING TO LET THE IRISH KNOW THAT SUCH CHANNELS EXIST.

FM FCO 071750Z SECRET TO PRIORITY DUBLIN TEL N0 108 OF 7 APRIL INFO BELFAST. MY TEL NOS 105 AND 106 OF 7 APRIL. MR LYNCH’S MESSAGE OF 29 MARCH GIVES THE PRIME MINISTER THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT SOME SUBSTANTIVE POINTS IN RETURN. BEFORE A DRAFT REPLY IS PREPARED, I SHOULD WELCOME YOUR ADVICE ON HOW WE MAY BEST FOLLOW UP WITH MR LYNCH THE ACTION WE ARE NOW TAKING IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
I SHOULD ALSO WELCOME AN UP-TO-DATE 
ASSESSMENT OF MR MYNCH’S OWN POLITICAL POSITION IN THE WAKE OF THE INITIATIVE, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH HE HOW PLANS, OR MAY BE PESUADED TO ACT MORE FORCEFULLY AGAINST THE IRA. .SPECIFIC POINTS WHICH ARISE, AND ON WHICH I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR COMMENTS, ARE THE FOLLOWING: (A) MR LYNCH MENTIONED IN HIS MESSAGE THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCUSSING QUESTIONS RAISED BY HMG’S INITIATIVE AND PARTICULARLY THE PROPOSAL FOR PLEBISCITES AT A MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO PRIME MINISTERS. ALTHOUGH SUCH A MEETING WILL NO DOUBT BE DESIRABLE LATER, TO FIX ONE IN THE NEAR FUTURE SEEMS TO US PREMATURE. TO DO SO WOULD AROUSE THE PROTESTANTS’ FEARS AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE. (B) PLEBISCITES ON THE BORDER. THIS PROPOSAL IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THE BALANCED PACKAGE OF MEASURES TAKEN AND PROPOSED BY HHG, AND PROVIDED THE IDEA APPEALS TO THE PROTESTANT COMMUNITY, WE SHOULD NOT AGREE TO DROP IT. WE CAN OF COURSE AGREE THAT THERE MUST BE A DANGER THAT THE HOLDING OF PLEBISCITES MIGHT BE OCCASIONS, FOR TENSION AND EVEN VIOLENCE BUT WE SHOULD EMPHASISE OUR INTENTION TO CONDUCT THESE IN A WAY AND AT A TIME CHOSEN TO MINIMISE THE DANGERS. (C) 
’’ ALL-PARTY TALKS ’’. THE IRISH TEND TO INTERPRET CALLS FOR 
TALKS BETEEN THE ’’INTERESTED PARTIES’’ TO MEAN THAT DUBLIN IS INVOLVED ON EQUAL TERMS WITH LONDON AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMUNITIES IN THE NORTH. 
IN OUR VIEW CONTACTS WITH DUBLIN WILL 
PROBABLY BE BEST MAINTAINED THROUGH THE DIPLOMATIC CHANNEL SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME BY MEETINGS BETEEN MINISTERS OF THE TWO GOVERNMENTS, BUT NOT BY THE ATTENDANCE OF DUBLiN REPRESENTATIVES AT ANY MEETINGS ’WHICH HMC MAY ARRANGE WITH MEBERS OF THE NORTHERN COMMMUNITIES. DO YOU THINK THAT ANYTHING NEEDS TO BE SAID AT THIS STAGE IN DUBLIN OR SHOULD WE WAIT UNTIL WE ARE NEARER TO THE SETTING UP OF ALL-PARTY TALKS?

SECRET TO IMMEDIATE FCO TELNO 015 OF 7 APRIL INFO IMMEDIATE DUBLIN pRIORITY NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE FROM SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND. NOW THAT WE HAVE STARTED TO RELEASE PEOPLE FROM INTERNMENT 
AND DETENTION, I HOPE HM AMBASSADOR IN DUBLIN MAY BE INSTRUCTED TO SPEAK TO MR LYNCH ON THE FOLLOWING LINES. 
2. MR LYNCH WILL BE AWARE THAT THE DECISION TO INTRODUCE UK RULE HAS PRODUCED A FAVOURABLE REACTION AMONG MANY CATHOLICS IN THE NORTH, AND A STRONG DESIRE ON THEIR PART TO HAVE AN END TO VIOLENCE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FIGURES ANNOUNCED TODAY FOR THE FIRST GROUPS OF INTERNEES AND DETAINEES TO BE RELEASED, AND THE STATEMENT THAT WE EXPECT TO CLOSE DOWN THE MAIDSTONE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL HAVE STRENGTHENED THAT DESIRE. THE LEADERSHIP OF THE IRA IN THE SOUTH IS CLEARLY AWARE OF THE THREAT TO ITS POLICIES IN THE NORTH POSED BY CATHOLIC OPINION HERE. WE MUST EXPECT THAT LEADERSHIP TO DO ITS UTMOST TO RECOVER LOST GROUND AND TO NEGLECT NO MEANS WHICH VIOLENCE MAY OFFER IN ORDER TO FRUSTRATE OUR POLICIES OF RECONCILIATION AND PEACE FOR ALL. THE NEXT FEW WEEKS ARE LIKELY TO BE VERY IMPORTANT. 
3. WE HAVE TAKEN AND ARE TAKING CONSIDERABLE RISKS IN OUR DETERMINATION TO PURSUE THE NEW POLICY. WE ARE AWARE OF THE FAVOURABLE RESPONSE WHICH IT HAS EVOKED AMONG POLITICAL AND PUBLIC OPINION IN THE SOUTH AND WE HOPE THAT THE GOVERNMENT. OF THE REPUBLIC WILL, ON THEIR SIDE, BE PREPARED TO TAKE STEPS TO HELP THE POLICY WHICH, AS WE SEE IT, IS IN THEIR INTEREST AS WEWL AS OURS. WE TRUST THAT MR LYNCH WILL DO ALL HE CAN TO ENCOURAGE THE ISOLATION OF THE IRA LEADERSHIP. WE ALSO HOPE HOWEVER THAT HE WILL FEEL ABLE TO TAKE CERTAIN PRACTICAL MEASURES WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN HIS ABILITY AND OURS TO PREVENT THE CONTINUATION OF VIOLENCE OR ANY ATTEMPT TO RAISE ITS LEVEL.

Northern Ireland Office Note of a meeting at 10 a.m. on 7 April 1. The interdepartmental meetings which have taken place in the Ministry 
of Defence, chaired by Sir James Dunnett, have been discontinued. In future meetings will be held in the Northern Ireland Office chaired by Mr Cairncross. Notes of the meetings will be circulated to those listed in Annex B. A daily report on the security situation in Northern Ireland will continue to be circulated by the Ministry of Defence. INTELLIGENCE 2. 
With the security forces not being active in the Roman Catholic enclaves, 
and adopting in general a ’lower profile’ the Director of Intelligence has reported that less information is being obtained from people arrested. This is to be expected. He has drawn attention to the risk that morale in the RUC Special Branch might deteriorate if the terrorist campaign continues during these developments, but has reported no sign of it doing so yet. The future plans of both the Ulster Vanguard and the IRA (Provisional) continue to be uncertain. SECURITY SITUATION 3. 
Although the number of incidents of terrorism is much the same, attacks 
are being pressed home with less determination. The Army is studying further ways of ’lowering its profile’ and improving its relations with the community. INTERNMENT 4. 
The Secretary of State announced today the release of 47 internees and 
26 detainees, which will enable HMS Maidstone no longer to be used as a place of detention. The present members of the advisory committee on internment have agreed to stay on only until 14 April and possible replacements are being considered.

THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A STATEMENT MADE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE, MR WILLIAM WHITELAW, AT A PRESS CONFERENCE IN STORMONT CASTLE ON FRIDAY 7 APRIL 1972 
A few days ago, when I first came here I called for an end to violence and asked for everyone to work for peace. 
Since then on all sides I have been struck by the will to end this tragic period in Northern Ireland’s history and to move forward again. 
I have been encouraged by the willingness to think again by those who may have reacted strongly to the measures which were so recently taken by Her Majesty’s Government. Equally I have been impressed by the courage of those who have been prepared to speak up against the law of the gun. 
So it is right that you should ask what My contribution is going to be. 
Without doubt a key issue is internment. Let no-one be under any illusion. The people who are behind the wire were put there because of the dangerous situation confronting this community in the recent past. 
But in this new mood of peace and reconciliation I have now decided it would be right for me to release some of the men interned immediately. 
As I promised I have begun to review personally the cases of the 728 people still interned under the Special Powers Act. This of course takes time. Initially I have looked at those cases which the security authorities have advised might be considered for early release and last night I signed Orders authorising the release of 47 internees. It did not seem to me to be right to delay the release of any internees until I had been able to complete my review of every case. I shall now proceed as quickly as possible to review the remaining cases and intend to authorise the release of any whom I consider suitable as soon as I have completed each one. 
The internees released today were not asked to give an undertaking about their future behaviour.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 113 
7 APRIL 1972 Incidents during the oast 24 hours The amount of shooting re 
the fact that casualties have been relatively slight suggest that much of it is inexpert and unco-ordinated. Yesterday there were eight shooting incidents in Londonderry and five in Belfast 
- 
none on the border. One soldier suffered a gunshot wound in Londonderry, and one policeman was hit in the leg in Belfast. 2. 
There were three explosions in Belfast - in one of which a 
warehouse in Dunmurry was severely damaged by a bomb of 50 - 100 lbs. There were no casualties. Between Aldergrove and Antrim a bomb exploded in a car outside a pub, but caused no damage to the building. Three bombs were found in a house near Coalisland and were safely detonated by a disposal team 
in the process. In Londonderry an armoured personnel carrier was attacked with a grenade in William Street and, while it was halted, 
a second bomb was placed alongside it by a boy aged about ten. He evaded capture and his contribution in fact did no material harm. 3. 
There was one armed robbery in Londonderry and another at 
Dungannon. 4. 
Hooliganism of the usual kind was well to the fore in London- 
derry. In Andersonstown the hooligans devoted their efforts to stoning an ambulance. 5. 
though - though the house was wrecked 
Three firearms in poor condition were found at a point near Ballynahinch, Co. Down - which is well within the Protestant- 
dominated part of the county, though that is not of course conclusive evidence as to which faction hid the weapons.

TO IMMEDIATE FCO TELNO 015 OF 7 APRIL INFO IMMEDIATE DUBLIN PRIORITY NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE FROM SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND. NOW THAT WE HAVE STARTED TO RELEASE PEOPLE FROM INTERNMENT 
AiD DETENTION, I HOPE HM AMBASSADOR IN DUBLIN MAY BE INSTRUCTED TO SPEAK TO MR LYNCH ON THE FOLLOWING LINES. 
2. MR LYNCH WILL BE AWARE THAT THE DECISION TO INTRODUCE UK RULE HAS PRODUCED A FAVOURABLE REACTION AMONG MANY CATHOLICS IN THE NORTH, AND A STRONG DESIRE ON THEIR PART TO HAVE AN END TO VIOLENCE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FIGURES ANNOUNCED TODAY FOR THE FIRST GROUPS OF inTERNEES AND DETAINEES TO BE RELEASED, AND THE STATEMENT THAT WE EXPECT To CLOSE DOWN THE MAIDSTONE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL HAVE STRENGTHENED THAT DESIPE. THE LEADERSHIP OF THE IRA IN THE SOUTH IS CLEARLY AWARE OF THE THREAT TO ITS POLICIES IN THE NORTH POSED BY CATHOLIC OPINION HERE. 
WE MUST EXPECT THAT LEADERSHIP TO DO ITS UTMOST TO 
RECOVER LOST GROUND AND TO NEGLECT NO MEANS WHICH VIOLENCE MAY OFFER IN ORDER TO FRRSTRATE OUR POLICIES OF RECONCILIATION AND PEACE FOR ALL. THE NEXT FEW WEEKS ARE LIKELY TO BE VERY IMPORTANT.

7 APRIL. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR MESSAGE OF THE 24TH MARCH ADVISING ME 
OF WHAT YOU INTENDED TO SAY IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS LATER IN THE DAY. 
SO FAR AS PUBLIC RESPONSE TO YOUR STATEMENT IN THE HOUSE IS 
CONCERNED I ISSUED A BRIEF COMMUNIQUE EARLY ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON LAST. ITS CONTENTS, NO DOUBT, WERE CONVEYED TO YOU. 
NATURALLY WE SAW IT AS OUR PRIMARY DUTY TO ENSURE, TO THE 
FULLEST EXTENT OUR INFLUENCE EXTENDED, THAT YOUR PROPOSALS SHOULD BRING AN END TO VIOLENCE ON THE ONE SDE WHILST ALSO AVOIDING VIOLENCE ON THE OTHER. THE LEADERS OF THE OPPOSITION PARTIES HERE, WITH WHOM I HAD PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS, WERE EQUALLY CONCERNED THAT THEIR COMMENTS AND THOSE OF THEIR COLLEAGUES SHOULD BE SUITABLY HELPFUL. THE SAME WAS THE VIEW OF THE LEADERSHIPS OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC AND LABOUR PARTY AND OF THE NATIONALIST PARTY WITH WHOM MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAD AMEETING ON FRIDAY EVENING. 
SO FAR EVENTS HAVE BEEN REASONABLY FAVOURABLE. I AM CONFIDENT 
THAT THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP OF THE MINORITY IN THE NORTH NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY, ALLIED TO THE SKILL AND DETERMINATION, TO LEAD THEIR COMMUNITY AWAY FROM ANY CONDONING OF THE FURTHER USE OF VIOLENCE. I AM ALSO MORE THAN A DEGREE OPTIMISTIC THAT THE BROAD MASS OF THE MAJORITY COMMUNITY PREFER TO LIVE IN PEACE AND WILL NOT FOLLOW A VIOLENT CRUSADE TO RESTORE A POLITICAL LEADERSHIP WHICH HAD GRIEVOUSLY FAILED THEM OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

NORTHERN IRELAND CURRENT SITUATION NO 110 Summary of the weekend 
Th Easter weekend - which, with its Republican connotations, 
tends to be a tense period in Northern Ireland at the best of times 
parade; the turnout was quite modest in - passed off relatively quietly. Both in Belfast and in 
Londonderry the Provisional and Official wings of the Republican movement ach staged a 
every case, the largest being just over 2,000, and rather unexpectedly the Officials march attracted a larger number than the Provisionald in Belfast 
- though it was the other way round 
in Londonderry. 2. 
These parades, and the other smaller ones which were held 
throughout the Province on Sunday, passed off without incident as did two further Republican parades, and a rally by the Protestant Apprentice Boys, on Monday. However, there were periodic outbreaks of shooting and explosions throughout the weekend, the worst day for them being Thursday 
- when a women died after being caught in 
cross-fire during a prolonged exchange of shots in Andersonstown ; there were several other shooting incidents; and nine explosions caused injuries to an Army Officer and 30 civilians. 3. 
Throughout the weekend there were statements and counter 
statements by those in favour of the IRA calling a halt to violence and by those who favour the IRA fighting on. On Sunday Cardinal Conway, in an interview with RT, spoke out in favour of an and to violence, claiming that this was the view of the majority of Catholics in the North; While in Londonderry the Provisionals’ Chief of Staff, John Stephenson, urged Catholics to maintain their solidarity with the IRA On Monday, following the funeral

TO PRIORITY FCO TELNO 318 OF 1 MAY INFO SAVING UKREP BELFAST. 
1. FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF TAOISEACH’S SPEECH AT BALLYBOFEY, CO. DONEGAL, ON 30 APRIL. EEC. 
THE TWO QUESTIONS WHICH NOW FACE US CONCERN THE KIND OF NEW IRELAND WHICH WE WANT. WE CANNOT OPT UT OF EITHER OR POSTPONE A DECISION BECAUSE INACTION TOO IN ITS OWN WAY WILL BE A KIND OF DECISION. WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE AS A NATION ACT ON EACH OF THESE TWO QUESTIONS IN THE MONTHS AHEAD WILL DETERMINE THE WHOLE CHARACTER OF OUR COUNTRY AND OUR OWN FUTURE FOR AS FAR AHEAD AS WE CAN SEE. THE FIRST CHOICE WE FACE IS A CLEAR-CUT ONE. ON 10 MAY YOU AND ALL OF US MUST DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO CHANGE OUR CONSTITUTION SO AS TO ALLOW IRELAND TO ENTER THE EEC. YOU HAVE HEARD THE ISSUE DEBATED ON RADIO AND TELEVISION. YOU HAVE READ ABOUT IT IN NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES. YOU ARE TOLD, ON THE ONE HAND, THAT TO JOIN THE EEC WILL SERVE OUR BEST INTERESTS AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT OUR INTERESTS WILL BE BETTER SERVED BY STAYING OUT. YOU CONSIDER, PERHAPS, THAT BOTH SIDES MEAN WELL BUT THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO WEIGH THE COMPLEX ISSUES WHICH ARE RAISED ON EITHER SIDE. FROM ALL THAT HAS BEEN SAID ON THESE QUESTIONS, I MUST ASK YOU TO KEEP THREE THINGS CLEARLY IN MIND. THE FIRST IS THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO ON 10 MAY, YOU CANNOT ESCAPE A CHOICE BETWEEN SAYING ’YES’ OR ’NO’ TO IRISH ENTRY TO THE EEC. THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY IN WHICH YOU CAN STAY WHOLLY ALOOF FROM THIS DECISION. IF YOU VOTE ’YES’ AT THE REFERENDUM, YOU CLEARLY ACCEPT THAT IRELAND’S FUTURE IS WITH THE EEC. IF YOU VOTE ’NO’ OR IF YOU DO NOT VOTE 
- YOU THEREBY HELP TO DECIDE THAT WE SHOULD 
STAY OUT. THE TRUTH IS THAT YOU CAN AVOID VOTING BUT YOU DO NOT THEREBY AVOID MAKING A CHOICE. THE SECOND POINT I SHOULD LIKE TO IMPRESS UPON YOU IS THAT THE CHOICE YOU MAKE IN TEN DAYS’ TIME IS BETWEEN TWO POSSIBLE FUTURES FOR IRELAND. WHATEVER YOU DO ON THAT DAY WILL HELP TO CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER. THE CHOICE OPEN TO YOU IS TO SAY WHAT KIND OF /CHANGE YOU

I HAVE MINUTED ON A TELEGRAM FROM DUBLIN THAT I DO NOT THINK 
I SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER MEETING WITH MR LYNCH UNTIL HE HAS CLEARLY INDICATED TO OUR AMBASSADOR IN DUBLIN THAT HE WILL PRODUCE HARD RESULTS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF IT. 
I SEE THAT NORA BELOFF MAKES 
THE SAME POINT IN THE OBSERVER TODAY, THOUGH I DO NOT THINK I WENT QUITE SO FAR AS SHE INDICATES WHEN I SAW HER LAST WEDNESDAY. 
THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS OF THIS. FIRST, I DO NOT THINK IT IS 
POLITICALLY POSSIBLE TO HAVE SUCH A MEETING IN LONDON AFTER THE INITIATIVE WE HAVE TAKEN WITHOUT BEING SURE OF GETTING RESULTS OUT OF MR LYNCH. 
AND SECONDLY, AS HE APPEARS TO WANT A MEETING, 
IN THE FIRST PLACE NO DOUBT TO BOOST HIS OWN POLITICAL PRESTIGE AND IN THE SECOND PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT HE GETS IN ON ANY CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAY BE MOOTED, IT WOULD SEEM TO BE THE ONLY WAY LEFT TO US TO BRING ANY PRESSURE ON HIM AT ALL. 
WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT ALL THIS?

Dr Hillery called on the Secretary of State on Thursday 27 April. Mr McCann (PUS to Dr Hillery), Dr O’Sullivan, the Irish Ambassador, Sir William Nield and Mr Trevelyan (Northern Ireland Office) and Sir Stewart Crawford (FCO) were present. 
The Secretary of State welcomed Dr Hillery who asked what were his impressions of Londonderry on his recent visit. The Secretary of State said that there were undoubtedly fears of Protestant reaction but that signs, such as the recent incident in the Waterside area, had been much exaggerated. He added that he had been encouraged by response from the Catholic community so far and hoped that the most recent releases from internment, including Sean Keenan, would help further. 
The Secretary of State said thathe intended to announce the lifting of the ban on marches later in the day together with an amnesty which would cover, amongst others, Miss Devlin and Mr McManus. He was considering the difficult problem of the "hard core" of internees and would welcome advice on how these people, some of whom had been involved in considerable violence, might best be treated. 
Dr Hillery said that Mr Lynch, who had asked him to make this visit, was anxious to help in the new situation which he described as something of a vacuum so far as normal political activity was concerned. It would be important to guide the IRA and other militant groups into politics. From the point of view of the South there was also the problem of bringing moderate middle opinion in the North to take a more open-minded view of the prospects of an eventual united Ireland. Mr Lynch could make a statement in the fairly near future which, if this seemed helpful, might indicate possibilities of constitutional change on the part of the Republic which made it easier for North and South to come together. Would it be useful to initiate contacts at official level, in particular on economic problems? One of the results of internment had been to remove a number of people who might have helped with a transition to politics by the IRA. This was not so much the case in Londonderry where Mr Hume seemed to carry considerable weight but did appear to be so in Belfast where many of those now involved were teenagers who could not easily be controlled by the truncated leadership.

ARMSTRONG AFTER I ANNOUNCED DIRECT RULE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND I 
EMPHASISED THE NEDED TO SET UP A SPECIAL BODY TO PRODUCE CONSTITUTIONAL PROPOSALS FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF MINISTERS, ETHER WITH A DETAILED PLAN AS TO HOW NEGOTIATIONS COULD BE CARRIED THROUGH. 
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SUCH A TASK, BOTH FORMULATION AND 
NEGOTIATION, REQUIRES HIGHLY SPECIALISED KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNIQUES. 
THE HOME OFICE NO LONGER HAS ANY CONNECTION WITH 
NORTHERN IRELAND AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND HIS COLLEAGUES, AND INDEED THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND, ARE TOO HEAVILY COMMITTED TO DEALING WITH DAY-TO-DAY AFFAIRS TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THE NECESSARY THOUGHT TO THESE MATTERS. 
KINDLY ADVISE ME WHAT ACTION IS BEING TAKEN IN THIS MATTER. I CANNOT OVER-EMPHASISE THIS URGENCY.

28th April, 1972 Northern Ireland: GEN 79 I am writing to confirm the arrangements made on the telephone 
for the slightly postponed meeting on Northern Ireland which the Prime Minister would like to hold. The meeting will be held at No. 10 on Tuesday, 2nd May, at 5.30 p.m. (a time which Irecognise is not entirely convenient to all those invited to attend, but is, I think, the least inconvenient possible). 
I understand the Secretary of State would wish to be accompanied 
at the meeting by senior officials and I should be grateful to be advised who they will be. 
I am sending copies of this letter to the Private Secretaries to 
the other Ministers invited to the meeting - the Home Secretary, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Secretary of State for Defence (who, I understand, wishes to be accompanied by the Minister of State for Defence and the CGS), the Lord President and the Attorney General; and to Alan Simcock at No. 10.

Present: The Rt. Hon. Sir Alec Douglas-Home 
KT MP Mr J A N Graham 
Dr Hillery Mr McCann 
HE Dr O’Sullivan 
Mr W K K White Sir Alec Douglas-Home welcomed Dr. Hillery and asked how the 
Irish now saw the situation. 2. 
Dr. Hillery said they thought there was something of a 
political vacuum. Mr. Lynch was prepared to try to give a lead, if he, Dr. Hillery, could obtain a clear picture of the likely course of events through his talks in London. 3. 
Sir Alec Douglas-Home said that Mr. Whitelaw was playing 
things very quietly, giving a chance for confidence to grow, and for those seeking a peaceful solution to come forward. Things were rather better, but there were grounds for very real concern in that more soldiers were now being killed. There was no doubt about substantial cross-Border movement. What more could the Irish do? 4. 
were a problem. 
Co-operation there was best achieved locally and not agreed formally at the political level. 
Sir Alec Douglas-Home 
emphasised the importance of a clear directive from the top instructing the Irish Police and Army on the Border to co-operate 
Dr. Hillery said they were trying their best. The Courts The Police on the Border had been reinforced.

PLEASE PASS THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO MR. LYNCH. 
BEGINS. ’’ I WAS GLAD TO RECEIVE YOUR MESSAGE AND GLAD ALSO TO SEE 
DR. O’SULLIVAN BACK IN LONDON. 
2. THE PROSPECTS FOR PEACE HAVE IMPROVED BUT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. IT IS TRUE THAT MANY OF THE MINORITY HAVE SPOKEN UP FOR PEACE, AND THAT THE IRA ARE IN SOME DISARRAY, BUT VIOLENCE CONTINUES. THE IRA HAVE SEEN THAT OUR INITIATIVE ITSELF, THE RELEASE OF INTERNEES, THE CLOSURE OF THE MAIDSTONE- INDEED THE WHOLE POLiCY OF RECONCILIATION 
- THREATENS THEIR STANDING WITH THE MINORITY 
OF THE NORTH. WE CAN BE SURE THAT THEY WILL FIGHT HARD TO RETAIN THEIR HOLD, AND THEIR ACTIVITY AS WELL AS THEIR STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN INFLAMMATORY. THEY SEE THE CONTINUANCE OF VIOLENCE AS NECESSARY TO PRESERVE THEIR POSITION. THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL BE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. ON OUR SUCCESS IN RE-ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER HANG THE CHANCES OF CREATING IN THE LONGER TERM A STABLE AND PROSPEROUS SOCIETY IN NORTHERN IRELAND WITH PEACE AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. 
3. I AM SURE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE FAIL TO BRING TERRORISM 
TO AN END DESPITE THE POLITICAL INITIATIVE WE HAVE EMBARKED UPON, THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WHOLE OF IRELAND WILL BE INCALCULABLE. 
4. BECAUSE OF THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF THIS FOR BOTH OUR GOVERNMENTS I WANT TO TAKE YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS OUR THINKING DEVELOPS. AT SO EARLY A STAGE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SET OUT IN DETAIL THE LINES OF OUR FUTURE POLICY, ASSUMING PEACE RETURNS TO NORTHERN IRELAND, BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WELCOME SOME INDICATION OF OUR THOUGHTS AS

HILLERY, DR. PATRICK JOHN Minister for External Affairs. Born 1923 in Milltown Malbay, Co. Clare. 
Educated at local National School, Rockwell College, Cashel, and University College Dublin (B.Sc. 1943, M.B., B.Ch. 1947); research into Tuberculosis in Canada and Ireland; T.D. for Co. Clare since 1951; member of Health Council, 1955-7; Medical Officer, Milltown Malbay, 1957-9; Coroner for West Clar, 1958-9; Minister for Education, 1959-65; for Industry and Commerce, 1965-66; for Labour 1966-9; and for External Affairs since 1969; Joint Honorary Seoretary of Fianna Fail since July, 1970. 
Dr. Hillery’s father, also a doctor, was 
Medical Officer of the Clare IRA during the liar of Independence: the family home was burned down by tho Black and Tans. 
Dr. Hillery was attracted to politics whilst in 
Canada: returning to Ireland in 1950, he became a supporter of Dr. Noel Browne over the Mother and Child Scheme. Until his appointment as Minister for Education in 1959, he was virtually unknown: but the then Taoiseach, Mr. Sean Lemass, described him as perhaps the most intelligent man in that Government, which was the first to admit new blood into the old party ranks. His experiences at the local National (i.e. State Primary) School and as a doctor had led him to believe in social and educational reform, leading to equality of opportunity, and to realise the need for some State restrictions on the capitalist system. He is a socialist: he has said that if tho Labour Party in the Republic were stronger he would Join it instead of Fianna Fail, whose tradition of speaking for the small farmers and town workers he considers the best practical platform for his views. As Minister for Education, Dr. Hillery was responsible for a steady improvement in schooling at all levels. The National School building programme was doubled. State scholarships were introduced. A Comprehensive Schools Scheme for areas inadequately served was introduced and substantial aid given to the Universities. Post-primary education was made compulsory, a Commission formed on Higher Education and an OECD report on the educational system invited. 
As Minister for Industry and Commerce, Dr. 
Hillery introduced the first Labour legislation for many years, including the establishment of a Labour Court and laws regulating unofficial strikes. He continued this programme in the new Department of Labour.

Fine Gael Labour 
Independent Fianna Fail 
(Blaney, Foley, Paudge Brennan) 
Aontacht Eireann 
(Sherwin) Independents

Although Fianna Fail still contains a few deputies who would regard themselves as fairly extreme Republicans, the main trouble-makers (Sherwin, Blaney, Foley and Brennan) are now out. Excluding the Speaker, that leaves 69 votes. Lenehan and Sheridan, the two Independents can be expected to vote solidly with the Government on all crucial issues, thus leaving the Government with a fairly certain 71 votes. 2. 
Blaney, Foley and Paudge Brennan said on 25 February 1972 
that their undertaking to support the Government in the Dail except on Northern Ireland policy no longer stood. 
This does not 
necessarily mean that they will henceforth vote as one with the Opposition. If, however, they did, Sherwin would almost certainly vote with them, giving a total Opposition vote of 72. (If he did not, there would be a tie

SECRET TO IMMEDIATE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE TELNO 003 OF 25 APRIL INFO FCO, DUBLIN 
FOLLOWING FOR TREVELYAN. 1. THE PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE TO MR LYNCH (FCO TEL NO. 118 TO DUBLIN) IS CLEARLY A BASIC DOCUMENT FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE’S MEETING WITH DR. HILLERY. I ASSUME THAT MR WHITELAW WOULD WISH TO BEGIN BY GIVING HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE POSITION FOUR WEEKS AFTER HIS ENTERING INTO OFFICE. WHEN THE DECISION WAS TAKEN TO IMPOSE UNITED KINGDOM RULE IT WAS RECKONED THAT THE IRA WOULD MAKE A STRONG EFFORT TO FRUSTRATE POLICIES OF RECONCILIATION, AND THAT PROTESTANT BITTERNESS MIGHT WELL LEAD TO SERIOUS TROUBLE FROM THEIR SIDE. THE PICTURE SO FAR HAS BEEN LESS UNFAVOURABLE THAN WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE PROTESTANT SUSPICIONS AND BITTERNESS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY DEEP BUT THE PROTESTANTS HAVE, WITH ONLY A FEW EXCEPTIONS, REFRAINED FROM VIOLENCE THE IRA HAVE CONTINUED THEIR POLICY OF VIOLENCE, NO DOUBT TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY, 
AND WE MUST EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO WHAT 
DAMAGE THEY CAN: BUT THE DESIRE OF THE GREAT MAJORITY OF CATHOLICS TO SEE VIOLENCE ENDED HAS BEEN EVIDENT AND IMPRESSIVE. NEVERTHELESS THE SITUATION IS FULL OF UNCERTAINTIES AND WE MUST EXPECT DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS TIMES AHEAD. DESPITE MANY PRESSURES THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS STUCK TO THE POLICY OF RUNNING DOWN INTErNMENT. HE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO, BUT WHAT HE CAN DO MUST DEPEND IN LARGE DEGREE ON WHAT THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY AND OTHERS CAN DO TO ISCLATE AND THUS DEFEAT THE IRA. THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS KEENLY AWARE THAT MEASURES IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS WELL NEED TO BE TAKEN, OF A KIND WHICH WILL GIVE CONFIDENCE TO ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY AND HOPEFULLY, TO ENCOURAGE THEM TOWARDS A GREATER PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE COUNTRY. 
HE IS GIVING URGENT THOUGHT TO THE CRUCIAL PROBLEM OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT, AND IN PARTICULAR TO THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING MEASURES WHICH WOULD HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT, ESPECIALLY ON THE YOUNG UNEMPLOYED. 2. MR WHITELAW MIGHT WISH TO SAY THAT WHILE RECOGNISING, AND APPRECIATING, THE WELCOME THAT WAS GIVEN IN THE REPUBLIC TO HMG’S DECISION AND THE EVIDENT WISH THERE THAT THE INITIATIVE SHOULD SUCCEED, HE BELIEVES THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT THESE ATTITUDES

Note of a meeting held on 25 April 
SECURITY SITUATION Shooting incidents continue to be many and explosions few. More shooting 
incidents than usual have been unexplained, possibly reflecting the increased tension between the communities which was evidenced by disturbances in Londonderry over the weekend. The barricades put up in the Waterside area then were removed yesterday as a result of peaceful persuasion. INTELLIGENCE 2. 
The Director of Intelligence has reported a deterioration in relations 
between the two communities and increased evidence of Protestant extremists trying to procure arms. 
Although there is still a feeling amongst Roman Catholics 
that the violence should end, practical support continues to be given to the IRA. CIVIL PROCEEDINGS 3. 
The settlement by which damages were awarded to 16 people who have been 
interned has not attracted much unfavourable comment. The claims were based on alleged treatment at Ballykinlar (during the ’exercises’) and Long Kesh (during disturbances there). 4.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 210700 hrs to 240700 hrs APR 72 GENERAL 1. 
The 72 hour period ending at 0700 hrs on Monday 24 April saw the first 
sign in Londonderry of the emergence of a Protestant reaction to the continuing situation in the BOGSIDE and CREGGAN: Protestant barricades were erected in the WATERSIDE area of LONDONDERRY. There were 24 minor instances of intersection activity throughout the province and a higher than usual level of unexplained shooting incidents. During the period there were 104 shooting incidents (in 29 of which Security Forces ore not involved and in 34 of which Scurity Forces returned fire) and 8 bomb explosions. 
2. On Friday21 April there were five explosions throughout the Province 
and a bomb on the border was neutralised with the cooperation of the Gardai. The current high rate of shooting incidents continued with 17 in BELFAST and 14 in LONDONDERRY. There were three Security Forces casualties, one serious; four terrorists are believed hit. On Saturday 22 April the number of shootig incidents was again high - 13 in BELFAST and 14 in LONDONDERRY, but only two explosions. The LAW meeting of 250 Protestants addressed by GlennBARR in LONDONDERRY failed to reach WILLIAM St after the intervention of the RUC, bit followingits dispersion across the FOYLE intersecterian strife flared up in IRISH St. Three barricades were built in the Protestant estate. The Northern Resistance Movement (NRM) rally at LONG KESH addressed by FARRELL, DEVLIN, BOYDE, McMANUS, HUNTER attracted only 120. On Sunday 23 April the two communities in the WATERSIDE of LONDONDERRY were again at loggerheads after a quiet night. The Catholics erected a barricade in IRISH St and stoning of the Security Forces continued with the military trying to keep a low profile. The Official Republican Convention in BELFAST in a DIVIS St building went off without incidents. There were shooting incidents in BELFAST, 19 shooting incidents in BELFAST, 13 in LONDONDERRY, and only 1 explosion overall. Hooligansism was at its normal high weekend level. 4 Security Forces and 3 civilians were wounded. 3 hits are claimed.

2. THE PROSPECTS FOR PEACE HAVE IMPROVED BUT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. IT IS TRUE THAT MANY OF THE MINORITY HAVE SPOKEN UP FOR PEACE, AND THAT THE IRA ARE IN SOME DISARRAY, PUT VIOLENCE CONTINUES. THE IRA HAVE SEEN THAT OUR INITIATIVE ITSELF, THE RELEASE OF INTERNEES, THE CLOSURE OF THE MAIDSTONE - INDEED THE WHOLE POLICY OF RECONCILIATION 
- THREATENS THEIR STANDING WITH THE MINORITY 
OF THE NORTH. WE CAN BE SURE THAT THEY WILL FIGHT HARD TO RETAIN THEIR HOLD, AND THEIR ACTIVITY AS WELL AS THEIR STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN INFLAMMATORY. 
THEY SEE THE CONTINUANCE OF VIOLENCE AS NECESSARY 
TO PRESERVE THEIR POSITION. THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL BE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. ON OUR SUCCESS IN RE-ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER HANG THE CHANCES OF CREATING IN THE LONGER TERM A STABLE AND PROSPEROUS SOCIETY IN NORTHERN IRELAND WITH PEACE AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. 
3. I AM SURE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE FAIL TO BRING TERRORISM 
TO AN END DESPITE THE POLITICAL INITIATIVE WE HAVE EMBARKED UPON, THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WHOLE OF IRELAND WILL BE INCALCULABLE. 
4. BECAUSE OF THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF THIS FOR BOTH OUR GOVERNMENTS I WANT TO TAKE YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS OUR THINKING DEVELOPS. AT SO EARLY A STAGE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SET OUT IN DETAIL THE LINES OF OUR FUTURE POLICY, ASSUMING PEACE RETURNS TO NORTHERN IRELAND, BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WELCOME SOME INDICATION OF OUR THOUGHTS AS MATTERS STAND.

Note of a meeting held on 21 April 
SECURITY SITUATION The numbers of shooting attacks and casualties to the security forces 
continues to be high, but there have been fewer explosions. The incident in Armagh prison was dealt with very effectively. The CGS has asked for an assessment to be made by 2 May of the effects of the Army’s ’lower profile’. INTELLIGENCE 2. 
The amount of informatin being obtained as a result of questioning at 
police holding centres is about one tenth of the amount being obtained before 24 March, and the amount derived from Army patrolling about one third. The state of intelligence in Londonderry is as good as, for example, in the Ardoyne in Belfast. The Provisional IRA is reliably reported to have ordered all trained men with arms to Northern Ireland this weekend, (such reports have been received before). A watch is being kept on a meeting due to be held on 23 April by the Republican Clubs: it is thought Tom McGill may attend. CROSS-BORDER ACTIVITY 3. 
The recent kidnapping and murder of a Corporal of the U.D.R. raised the 
question again of what might be said to the authorities in the Irish Republic about terrorist activity across the border. A possible message to Mr Lynch is still being considered. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office have been in touch with officials of the Irish Republic about this particular incident, but it would be unwise to rely on any new action flowing from their assurances. CREGGAN AND BOGSIDE 4. 
An article by Richard Cox in today’s ’Daily Telegraph’ is unfortunate in its 
assessment of the risks that would be involved in carrying out a military operation to remove the barricades and institute patroing in the reggan and bogside.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORTS It has been decided that, in the interests of speed, it would 
be preferable to circulate the situation report prepared every morning (Monday-Friday) by the General staff, rather than to continue issuing the separate DS10 report laterin the day - which covers essentially the same ground. (Reports of the routine meetings held twice a week 
- now in the Northern Ireland Office 
are of course now being issued separately by NIO. Distribution of these within MOD is on a slightly narrower basis than that of the daily sitrep.) 
2. 3. The General Staff sitrep is normally available by 9.30 a.m. 
Circulation within MOD will be undertaken by M04; circulation outside MOD will be the responsibility of DS10. 
A copy of today’s sitrep is attached for addressees outside MOD (NIO copies already despatched separately.)

NIOM (72) 4 Note of a meeting held on l8 April 
INTELLIGENCE It is tnought that an Active Service Unit coming from the Irish Republic 
and consisting of six members of the Official IRA was responsible for the shooting attack in the Divis area of Belfast yesterday. 2. 
The Director of Intelligence-reports that both factions of the IRA have now 
succeeded in giving the impression that they wish the campaign of violence to go on. Some of the recent violence may be designed to make it more difficult to release internees, but the shooting of McCann (a leading member of the Officials) is being used by the Officials as an excuse for violence in ’retaliation’ His funeral is this afternoon. (Also see paragraph 5). OPERATIONS 3. 
The recent level of shooting attacks has been high, and the rate of Army 
casualties has not dropped in spite of the ’low profile’ currently being adopted. 4. 
Ways in which the Army could broaden its activities by contributing to civil 
projects are being considered with a view to this being further discussed in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office in London will also be kept in touch. DEATH OF McCANN 5. 
The IRA are reported to have claimed that McCann was responsible for the 
death of fifteen British soldiers. He was shot by the Army after he had evaded arrest and taken no heed of warnings. Replies to press enquiries about the incident will concentrate on giving the facts and, sofar as possible, avoid entering into argument about the justification for opening fire. 6. HQ Northern Ireland have been asked to consider whether any further guidance is necessary to cover situations in which people attempt to evade arrest or escape from detention.

18 April 1972 LYNCH TELEGRAM 
Since we spoke this morning I have confirmed with my Secretary of State in Northern Ireland that he is in agreement with the telegram as drafted by the Foreign Office and amended by our officials. His only additional point is that he considers there should be a reference to Mr Lynchs helpful speech of 15 April. I am sending a copy of this letter to Robert Andrew in Ministry of Defence and to Johnny Graham in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

If the present 
pattern of events is allowed to continue it could in a very short time destroy the prospects of putting an end to violence. 
You know that my colleagues and I have never advocated a "military victory" policy; we are, however, gravely concerned at the obvious change in the role of the security forces - I need only cite the TV evidence of armed men openly and without hindrance controlling vehicular and pedestrian traffic in Londonderry. 
We would welcome an assurance from yourself that the security forces will continue to seek out and detain dangerous men and that the terrorists will not be permitted to strengthen their grip on entrenched enclaves. 
For that reason I hesitate to criticise

MONDY - 17th APRIL 1972. At their meeting this morning the members of the former 
Northern Ireland Cabinet, who are continuing to meet as a shadow Cabinet, expressed their sympathy with the relatives of the three soldiers killed at the weekend. They considered on a province-wide basis the present security situation and were unanimously of the conviction that the marked escalation in violence, both in the bombing campaign and in outbreaks of rioting, was a matter of the utmost concern. They had received evidence that changed directives, issued to the security forces last week, were enabling the terrorists to promote riot, arson and shootings on a wider scale, especially in areas which had previously been relatively clear of I.R.A. activity for many mont The shadow Cabinet believes that unless firm measures are 
taken Northern Ireland will be back to the perilous position in which terrorists can rebuild the strength of their own organisations and engender riot situations in areas where they have support. 
This would constitute not only a grave threat to 
the lives and property of the Ulster community but would unnecessarily put at risk the lives of other members of the security forces who have fought so gallantly against this menace to society. The shadow Cabinet is concerned that Mr. Heath’s instructions are quite different to his attitude expressed on many occasions about the need for ruthless pursuit of terrorists. The shadow Cabinet has today sought directly from Mr. Heath an explanation of the change in policy.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 119 17 APRIL 1972 
Incidents during the last 72 hours The main feature of the weekend was the very large amount of 
shooting. In all there were over ninety outbreaks of firing, nearly all of them in the two cities (with Belfast having roughly two-thirds, to Londonderry’s one-third). On the other hand, after the many bomb attacks of the previous three days, there were just eight explosions during the weekend and none of them caused any major injuries. 2. 
The most significant shooting incident was that in which 
Joseph McCann, a leading member of the Official IRA, was shot and killed. McCann was spotted at about 3.15 on Saturday afternoon by two Special Branch detectives, on his home ground in the Markets area in central Belfast. As they followed him they encountered a patrol of 1 Para, whose help they enlisted. The detectives then attempted to arrest McCann but he pushed past them and ran off, ignoring warnings to stop. Details of what ensued are still being obtained, but it is certain that he was hit by at least two or three shots from the patrol, and that he died on the way to hospital. No firearm was found on his body. He was by his own admission a leading terrorist and boasted of having killed several people; he was actually wanted for the murder of two soldiers outside the Royal Victoria Hospital last September, though it is not certain that these or other murder charges could have been proved. 3. 
There was a sharp reaction to McCann’s death among the 
Catholics. It mainly took the form of barricade-building and minor rioting in the areas around the Upper Falls Road, but there was also an intensification in the amount of shooting. There had already been 14 outbreaks in Belfast on Friday; on Saturday there were 20

11 April, 1972 You wrote to John Graham on 29 March enclosing a 
copy of a secret message from Mr. Lynch to the Prime Minister and said that you thought the Prime Minister would wish to send a more than merely formal reply. You also asked for advice on how the Prime Minister might handle the relationship with the Irish Government in the coming weeks. 
Since then you will have seen the exchange of 
telegrams with Sir J. Peck, which set out not only the main points which the Prime Minister himself had raised, but also some other points we had in mind. 
The text has been approved by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. 
The attached draft is, I hope, self-explanatory, It is based on the belief that the IRA’s 
grip on the minority has not been sufficiently loosened; that the brighter future, whichwe hope will materialise is not certain to do so; and that firm action against the IRA is necessary if the opportunity given by the initiative is not to be missed. 
The draft concludes by making 
specific suggestions about how co-operation between the Garda andthe Security Forces could be improved.

NORTHERN IRELAND The Defence Secretary held a meeting yesterday afternoon 
with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The Chief of the General Staff and the GOC Northern Ireland were also 
present. Security Situation 2. 
Mr. Whitelaw said that the security authorities in 
Northern Ireland, and in particular the Special Branch, were concerned about the effects of the new low profile security posture, and about the diminution of intelligence which was resulting from the reduction in the number of arrests. There were fears that the morale of the Special Branch might suffer, which would have serious consequences since their continued cooperation was essential. On the other hand, he felt that the continued arrest of relatively unimportant people was of limited value and was likely to have adverse political effects. It was necessary to walk a tight rope between getting the necessary intelligence and not alienating moderate Catholic opinion. He added that he believed it was important to keep up a steady release of internees: from the cases he had examined he was not convinced that there had in many instances been strong grounds for internment. 
3. In discussion the point was made that the arrest of even 
minor IRA members helped to build up the intelligence picture and to contribute to the attrition of the IRA; it could also lead to more important arrests. On the other hand, the collection of intelligence must not be allowed to become an end in itself. It was now important to try to separate the moderate Catholics from the IRA and the arrest by night of minor suspects by the Army could frustrate this objective. The aim should be to try to arrest those extremists whom moderate opinion would like to see removed because they stood in the way of conciliation. It might be necessary in future to play down the arrests, to adopt softer methods and to make more use of the police. General Tuzo undertook to brief General Ford on this aspect

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 14 APRIL 1972 
118 
Incidents during the past 24 hours Terrorist activity was at a comparatively high level throughout 
the Province with a concerted bombing campaign by the IRA apparently designed to impress on the Catholic population their determination to continue the campaign of violence. There was a total of 24 bomb explosions and a further five bombs were defused by Army disposal experts. 2. 
18 of the bomb explosions were in the rural areas. They 
included a bomb attack on the Council Office at Newry, where a security guard was shot in the legs; an explosion in a derelict house near Crossmaglen in which three soldiers were slightly injured; an attack on electricity pylons near Crossmaglen and an attack on the Cattle Marketing Office at Newtownhamilton. In addition four other bombs were defused by Army bomb disposal experts. 3. 
There were three explosions in Belfast. The Smithfield Bus Station was extensively damaged by a 50 - 100 lb bomb; a car hire 
firm in Grosvenor Road was also seriously damaged by a 100 lb bomb; and a 15 lb bomb caused minor damage to the Beechlawn Hotel, Dunmurry A malicious fire at the University Air Squadron building in Belfast caused four civilian casualties, afourth bomb, in a car in Corporation Street, was dealt with by a trained soldier firing a Carl Gustav anti-tank rocket with an inert warhead at the car under the supervision of a bomb disposal expert: the first operational use of this technique and a considerable success.

Note of a meeting held on 14 April 
INTELLIGENCE The Director of Irtelligence’s assessment is that the IRA are doing a 
lot towards regaining the initiative, and that while the mood for peace is still present it will take time to grow. The drop in the amount of intelligence being received has been considered in Northern Ireland and in London. The Director of Intelligence is considering with the Head of RUC Special Branch what might be done to increase it, and the G.O.C. and Chief Constable are considering what increased part might be played by the RUC. Meanwhile a few less important suspects may be arrested as well as ring-leaders (who produce less information). In the light of wild rumours that have been circulating in Northern Ireland about the future of the RUC, and divergent views within the force on present policies, the Secretary of State is attending a R.U.C. Special Branch monthly conference and, later, a meeting of the Police Representative Body. TOM McGILL (McGIOLLA) McGill, President of Sinn Fein (Official) is reported to be planning to 
speak in the centre of Belfast on 16 April. If he did he would be liable to be arrested, but th political implications of this are being considered. SECURITY SITUATION The Provisionals have carried on with violence much as before. The recent 
spate of explosions might have been a training exercise. Shooting attacks continue not to be pressed home. Membership of the Ulster Defence Regiment indicates that there have been neither resignations nor a falling off in recruitment of significance.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND UPON THE SCARMAN REPORT 
Following is the text of Mr. William Whitelaw’s comment today: "The events of 1969, which have had such desperate and long- 
lasting consequences for the people of Northern Ireland and indeed for the United Kingdom as a whole, have attracted worldwide attention and have been subjected to the examination of many observers. I am satisfied that Mr. Justice Scarman and his 
colleagues, whose enquiry into these events has been patient, thorough and immenselypainstaking, have provided the definitive historical account of those tragic and traumatic events. 
Mr. Lavery and to Mr. Marshall our very sincere appreciation of thessacrifices they have made and of the public spirit which they have shown in carryng through their enormous task. The Tribunal has disentangled the conflicting evidence which has been submitted from many sources to give a full-scale history and interpretation of what can only be described as the tragedy of 1969. 
"It is my first duty to express to Mr. Justice Scarman, to "I am not now concerned with the attribution of blame. As 
we read this Report carefully and with a sense of responsibility which all of us in Northern Ireland must share I hope we will find that such attribution is merely a continuation of sterile and disruptive thinking. 
"I am convinced however that the people of Northern Ireland now wish to go forward in harmony and in co-operation and will 
regard this uniquely important historical document as the end of an era. Even more important, they must regard it as the beginning of a much better and much more constructive time. 
"Much more could be said. I would suggest, however, that the 
main lesson to be. drawn from the Tribunal’s Report is that judgment taken in the heat of violent controversy can be a dangerous contributory factor to an escalation of that controversy and of the physical violence which can accompany it. The exercise of reason, goodwill and patience, however difficult that may be, is the surest way to contribute to community harmony. I want to see reason, I want to see goodwill, above all I want to see peace. Many myths have been exploded by this Report 
- myths about the 
IRA’s role in the 1969 riots: myths about the so-called organised attack by Protestants on Catholics and myths about the behaviour of the RUC, which in general terms emerges well. While noting the specific criticisms of members of the force while under extreme pressure, it is onty fair to stress that the Report rejects utterly the charge that the RUC was a partisan force co-operating with one section of the community against another. 
"If the lesson is learned then I am certain that never again 
will we see a recurrence of the events which so distorted and so debased our community in the past few years."

THE SCARMAN REPORT The Scarman Report on tho violence and civil disturbance in 
Northern Ireland in 1969 published today says there was no plot to overthrow tho Government or to mount an armed insurrection. The Report says that neither the IRA nor any Protestant 
organisation, nor anybody else, planned a campaign of rots. There were communal disturbances arising from a complex political, social and economic situation. (Para 24). There wore however planned acts of violnce by both extreme 
Protestants and by republican elements and the attack on Crossmaglen RUC police station in August 1969 is hold to be an IRA operation which, if it had succeeded, would have led to the murder of a number of innocent people (para 3 -7) and serious damage to private property. The Royal Ulster Constabulary is f ound to have made serious 
mistakes in six incidents including the use of armoured cars fitted with browning machine guns. But the Report stresses that the great majority of the members of the RUC were concerned to do their duty, to maintain order on the streets, using no more force than was reasonably necessary to suppress rioting and protect life and limb. It rejects the accusation that the RUC was a partisan force 
co-oporating with Protestant mobs to attack Catholic people. The Report says the charge "is devoid of substance and we reject it utterly" (para 3 -2). Of tho USC the Report states that there are no grounds for 
singling out mobilised USC as being guilty of misconduct although when used for riot control outside Belfast they showed on several oooaaions a lack of proper discipline particularly in the use of firearms (paragraphs 3 -23 and 24). The Report states that the USC were neither trained nor equipped for riot control duty (paragraph 3 -11).

Scarman Report The Scarman Report is being published tomorrow, 
6 April. With Stormont standing prorogued it will not be laid before the Northern Ireland Parliament and the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act imposes no obligation on the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to lay it before Parliament at Westminster. Copies are, however, being sent personally to all Members of the Northern Ireland Parliament and they are also being made available in some quantity to Parliament at Westminster. The bulk of the Report consists of detailed narrative 
and the Tribunal, as they make clear in their preface, have confined themselves to making findings "only in those instances in which we have felt sure that we know the truth." As a result, and conveniently, the Report is unlikely to inflame opinion significantly. Such criticisms as it makes are cautious and restrained and are spread fairly evenly over most of the parties to the disturbances. The important section of the Report is from page 10 
to page 19, about the origin and nature of the disturbances, and about the role of the RUC and USC. The main conclusions which emerge are:(i) There were certain planned acts of violence, i.e. explosions engineered by extreme Protestants on public utility installations in March and April 1969, bomb attacks on Belfast post offices in

4th April 1972 The Searman Report, of which I enclose an advance copy, will be 
published on Thursday 6th April. With Stormont standing prorogued it will not be laid before the Northern Ireland Parliament and the Northern Ireland 
(Temporary Provisions) Act imposes no obligation on the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to lay it before Parliament at Westminster. I understand, however, that copies will be sent personally to all members of the Northern Ireland Parliament and they will also be made available on a generous scale to Parliament at Westminster. 
I write this letter without having seen the report but I gather that 
it is critical of particular individuals on both sides of the fence without making sweeping condemnations. Now that copies are available we shall be working out what should be said to the press but my guess is that in present circumstances we shall want to play it in as low a key as possible. 
I am sending copies of this letter with copies of the report to 
Peter Gregson (No. 10), Brian Norbury (Cabinet Office) and Ronnie Custis (M.O.D.) . Copies of the letter without enlosure go to Clive Cullerne-Bown and Steve Bennett (H.O.) and to Neil Cairncross (N.I.O.).
