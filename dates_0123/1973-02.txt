REINFORCEMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND Reference: A. 
1. 
A/120/GEN/6103 (ASD 2a) dated 29th January 1973, (not to all). Contingency planning is in progress for the possible reinforcement 
of Northern Ireland to cover the period of the Plebiscite and the publication of the constitutional White Paper. 
2. If deployed, reinforcements for the period of the Plebiscite will 
affect neither BAOR nor the AMF(L). 3. 
As regards the White Paper it is planned to place four battalions 
in BAOR at 72 hours notice to move to Northern Ireland from the day of publication of the White Paper (P day). At this stage the plan has not yet been finally approved. The units concerned would be warned by P-4 days. 
4. If the reinforcement takesplace, it will raise the number of major 
units temporarily redeployed from BAOR from its current figure of seven to eleven, of which six (at the likely date for P day) will be infantry battalions and five will be other major units acting in the infantry role. 
If this contingency plan is put into effect we seem certain to be criticised by our NATO Allies on at least two grounds: 
5. 
a. that the total number of units withdrawn from BAOR will have reached a new peak - the previous all-time high was nine major units at the time of Operation MOTORMAN. 
b. that the withdrawal of six of the thirteen infantry battalions from the three divisions of 1 (r) Corps will have extremely serious consequences for NATO in operational terms. 
6. Under the terms of SOP36 DS7 is to inform DS12 and the FCO(WOD) and 
give advance warning to UKDEL, and COSSEC is to give advance warning to UKMILREP and UKNMR, if it is decided to place units at 72 hours readiness. For practical purposes this usually has meant that DS7 and COSSEC send out an agreed signal to all these addressees.

REINFORCEMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND TO COVER THE PLEBISCITE AND THE PUBLICATION OF THE WHITE PAPER 
BACKGROUND 1. 
You are aware that GOC Northern Ireland has asked for 
reinforcements: a. 
b. To deploy (on 3/4 Mar) to cover the Plebiscite. To stand by to cover the publication of the White 
Paper should there be a sudden upsurge of violence, particularly in the hard Protestant areas of North and East Belfast. 
2. The day of the White Paper’s publication is referred to 
throughout this minute as P Day. The date has not of course been settled yet, but we are working on the assumption that it will be approximately 2-3 weeks after the Plebiscite. 
3. 
GOC Northern Ireland has assessed the requirement as being: a. 
The Plebiscite. To deploy on 3/4 Mar: Two battalions 
b. 
The White Paper. (1) 
To be at 24 hours notice from P Day: 
Two further battalions One field squadron Royal Engineers 
(2) To be at 72 hours notice from P Day: 
Six further battalions One armoured car squadron One further field squadron Royal Engineers

1. I have been considering proposals to reinforce Northern 
Ireland for the Plebiscite on 8 March and the need for precautionary measures following the subsequent publication of the White Paper. 
You will wish to know my conclusions. 
THE PLEBISCITE 2. 
should be deployed to Northern Ireland. 
For the Plebiscite, the GCC has asked that two more units These will be found 
from the UK and the units concerned will be warned on 26 February and will deploy on 3/4 March. 
In reply to press inqiiries we 
shall say that the two units are being sent as a precautionary measure in case trouble arises during the polling and to assist the RUC in protecting polling stations. THE WHITE PAPER 3. 
It 
The publication date is not yet settled, but we are assuming that it will take place 2 - 3 weeks after the Plebiscite. 
is not proposed to deploy more units to Northern Ireland in advance of publication but, against the possibility that publication will be followed by a strong upsurge of violence particularly in the hard Protestant areas in North and East Belfast, it is proposed to put 2 units at 24 hours notice, and a further 6 units at 72 hours notice, from the day of publication of the White Paper. These plans will involve cancelling arrangements already made for training overseas; the units concerned (2 in UK, one in BAOR) will be told about this on 26 February. 
But although we shall 
tell all commanding officers in confidence at that time, none of the 8 units will be formally alerted for possible duty in Northern Ireland earlier than 6 days before the White Paper is published. 
on stand-by will become public knowledge. and not necessarily undesirable. 
At that stage the fact that we will be holding units This is inevitable 
In answer to press inquiries 
we shall take the line that it. is only sensible to have a number of units at short notice at the time the White Paper is published. We shall not of course give any detail about the numbers and identity of the units concerned or their state of readiness.

BORDER PLEBISCITE - 
INTRODUCTION 1. 
SECURITY ASSESSMENT A plebiscite concerning the border is to be held on 8 March 
1973 throughout Northern Ireland. All those who are registered to vote in Northern Ireland for candidates in UK parliamentary elections will be entitled to vote either in person or by postal vote at the plebiscite. Voters will be asked to answer one of two questions on their ballot paper:- 
a. 
of the United Kingdom. b. 
2. Do you want Northern Ireland to remain part 
with the Republic of Ireland outside the United Kingdom. 
Do you want Northern Ireland to be joined The control of the plebiscite is vested in six Under 
Sherrifs appointed by the Governor, who are responsible for preparation and issue of ballot papers and postal votes, the location of polling stations, the conduct of the plebiscite, and the final counting of votes. 
3. 
been completed, al1 ballot boxes are to be transported to a counting house (Floral Hall Bellevue Belfast) to be counted centrally on March. The result will be conveyed to S of SN when counting is completed. 
The Under Sherrifs have arranged that after polling has 4. Because of the security situation, and with the S of S’s 
approval, the number of polling stations has been reduced from over 900 to some 390. Whilst this has considerably eased the tasks of the Security Forces up to 200 of these will still reuire a military presence in the area to ensure that potential trouble does not occur. 
5.. As an indication of the response to the postal vote facilities, it is noted that by the closing date or applications(16 February) some 161,000 or 16% of the electorate had applied to by post. 
ATTITUDES OF THE COMMUNITY TOWARDS THE PLEBISCITE 6. 
The general attitude of the Catholic community towards 
the plebiscite is that it is merely a sop to the Protestants, that the outcome is a foregone conclusion, and that it has no real significance for them. Both the Official Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA/Sinn Fein have advised their members to boycott it (the Official Sinn Fein qualifying its advice to permits members to vote in the plebiscite only in the unlikely event of a similar plebiscite being held in the Republic).

2. 3. I regret DS12 cannot help on the background to the 
reinforcement programme which would seem to fall entirely to DS10. 
DS12 is concerned, however, with the tactics of informing NATO, (in conjunction with the FCO), 
possibilities viz: a. 
notice. b. 
the placing of the 4 units at 72 hours tho decision to move them, 
will, I think, need separate consideration. 4. 
"normal" procedures ie letter from our Permanent Representative to the Secretary-General copied to other Permanent Representatives plus a notification by Milrep to his colleagues, and the usual signal to SACEUR. Since the units are to be warned at P-4 the news will almost certainly get out and I think it is probably better that we should own up and that we should do so at the same time as the units are warned. 
As regards a. we could either say nothing or adopt the 5. What we do about b. then rather depends on events. I 
understand actually deploying all four units is getting towards the "worst case" end of the spectrum. It would certainly represent a quantum 
. jump in our demands on BAOR 
and seriously alarm NATO. In these circumstances we might need to consider something more analogeous to the FOLKLORE arrangements. If it is only one or two units which eventually move then we can probably continue existing practices.

REINFORCEMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND Reference: A. 
1. 
A/120/GEN/6103 (ASD 2a) dated 29th January 1973, (not to all). Contingency planning is in progress for the possible reinforcement 
of Northern Ireland to cover the period of the Plebiscite and the publication of the constitutional White Paper. 
2. If deployed, reinforcements for the period of the Plebiscite will 
affect neither BAOR nor the AMF(L). 3. 
As regards the White Paper it is planned to place four battalions 
in BAOR at 72 hours notice to move to Northern Ireland from the day of publication of the White Paper (P day). At this stage the plan has not yet been finally approved. The units concerned would be warned by P-4 days. 
4. If the reinforcement takesplace, it will raise the number of major 
units temporarily redeployed from BAOR from its current figure of seven to eleven, of which six (at the likely date for P day) will be infantry battalions and five will be other major units acting in the infantry role. 
5. If this contingency plan is put into effect we seem certain to be criticised by our NATO Allies on at least two grounds: 
a. that the total number of units withdrawn from BAOR will have reached a new peak 
at the time of Operation MOTORMAN. 
b. that the withdrawal of six of the thirteen infantry battalions from the three divisions of 1 (Br) Corps will have extremely serious consequences for NATO in operational terms. 
6. Under the terms of SOP36 DS7 is to inform DS12 and the FCO(WOD) and 
give advance warning to UKDEL, and COSSEC is to give advance warning to UKMILREP and UKNMR, if it is decided to place units at 72 hours readiness. For practical purposes this usually has meant that DS7 and COSSEC send out an agreed signal to all these addressees. 
- the previous all-time high was nine major units

NORTHERN IRELAND REINFORCEMENTS 1. 
In view of the events of the last 36 hours, you will wish 
to know that we consulted HQ UKLF about the two extra battalions which might be required should further violence erupt in the Protestant areas of Belfast. 
a. b. 
3 RGJ left Northern Ireland on 13 Dec 72. 2 GREN GDS (already nominated to deploy on 3/4 Mar) 
are involved on Public Duties. c. 
2. The plan to relieve 2 GREN GDS (after their deployment 
on 3/4 Mar) with 3 RGJ should stand, because 2 GREN GDS must be back in GB by 24 Mar. 
3 RGJ as Spearhead battalion would have to be selected. 3. 
Finally, all these battalions,of course, feature in the contingency plan to cover the Plebiscite and the White Paper. 
4. 
However, if 2 units were required early and in a great hurry, In that 
event, 2 RRF would be brought to notice, and deployed as quickly as possible. 
2 RRF and 1 A and SH are of course at 7 days notice. Both 
battalions are based in barracks on normal training and will disperse for normal weekend leave on Friday unless ordered otherwise. 
prefer to use 2 RRF and 1 A and SH if at all possible, despite the fact that 3 RGJ are the Spearhead battalion.

asked for a note on Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution of 1937, with particular reference to Mr. James’s suggestion of a new Anglo-Irish Treaty. I enclose a note which has been prepared after discussion with the Northern Ireland Office. 
I am sending a copy of this letter and its enclosure to Platt, (Northern Ireland Office).

IRISH CONSTITUTION : ARTICLES 2 AND 3 Article 2 of the Irish Constitution claims to apply to 
"the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas"; Article 3 limits the effective rule of the Dublin Government to the 26 counties "pending the reintegration of the national territory". The claim by the Dublin Government to the whole of 
Ireland however theoretical has always been a source of annoyance to the majority in Northern Ireland. It also bedevils other aspects of North-South and Anglo-Irish relations. It may be noted that we do not sign an agreed bilateral text of any Treaty with the Irish. They cannot accept the title "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"; we cannot accept less. For everyday purposes we avoid the problem by having two texts, identical save in title; each side signs its own version and keeps a Xerox copy of the other. Various proposals for reducing or eliminating the irritation 
caused by this problem have been put forward. Dr. Whitaker, the Governor of the Irish Central Bank, who is close to Mr. Lynch and a known moderate, who is often given credit for having initiated the O’Neill-Lemass talks and who is currently a contact of the British Embassy and of the Northern Ireland Office, has informally suggested that the Irish should drop Articles 2 and 3, and redefine Northern Ireland’s position by an Anglo-Irish Treaty. Unfortunately, a major difficulty is that a change in the Constitution of the Irish Republic requires approval by

During the most active day at the weekend SF were involved in 24 of the 
32 shooting incidents. After a relatively quiet morning, at 1515 hrs, in the New Lodge what appeared to be well organised and planned disturbances, SF patrols were stoned and fired upon. At 1815 hrs all action ceased on a whistle blast suggesting that the whole manoeuvre had been a elaborate method of setting up an ambush for SF. A total of 88 baton rounds were fired during the incidents. In the Ardoyne there were 7 separate shooting incidents mainly directed at the OP at 83 Alliance Avenue from across the interface. In 1 incident lasting less than 5 minutes 80 rounds were fired at the OP and a civilian received GSW to the foot. At 1040 hrs a burst of 20 shots were fired from a stolen car travelling N along Falls Road at a group near Daley’s Garage, there were 3 casualties (all RC) but none are listed. At 1800 hrs a gunman was seen firing South from Armsworth Avenue across the Springfield Road into the Catholic area around Tennyson Street, 2 small girls (both aged 9 and RC) were later admitted to the RVH. At 2145 hrs in Castle St (just W of City Centre) 2 Catholic children were taken into a car by 3 masked men in Combat kit. One of the children has since returned home but Michael McConnvill (10 - RC) is still missing. Apart from one shooting incident at the Beers Bridge triangle East Belfast was quiet. There have been several incidents of intimidation around the city. Arrests included the Finance Officer of F Coy 2 Provo, and 3 volunteers. It is thought that one of the latter could be the OC of D Coy 3 Provo.

There was 1 shooting incident in the South Enclave in which SF were not 
involved. There was minor hooliganism in the Shantallow Estate when youths set fire to a shed of straw. A gang of youths threw a CS grenade at a patrol in the Creggan, and there was an armed robbery in Brandywell. 
Follow up report. The explosion which wrecked a chemists shop in the Foyle 
Road on 10 Feb 73 was caused by a 10 to 20 lb device. The chemist concerned had been trading with SF. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 3. 
There were 5 shooting incidents of which 3 involved SF At Gough 
Barracks in Armagh the sentry was fired on from the direction of Tower Hill Hospital. He returned fire and claimed a hit. There were 7 bomb explosions. Two of these were in Enniskillen, when two separate 30 lb devices caused minor damage to two garages. At 2135 hrs on the Newtownbutler/Clones Road (A34) a 30-50 lb device wrecked the customs post, and a similar device wrecked a Newtownbutler garage an hour later, causing minor casualty to a member of the RUC. There were two explosions outside RC owned bars in Tandragee. About 40 lbs of explosive was used in both cases. A car believed to have been used in connection iwth one of the bombs had been stolen from Portadown earlier in the day. A bomb destroyed a garage in Glenarm. There was hooliganism after a meeting in Dungiven, which had proclaimed support for the 2 teachers Brolly and Kane arrested earlier this year. There petrol bombs were thrown, and the RUC station was stoned. There were minor facial injuries to a member of SF. An arms find in Dungiven produced 1 Thompson SMG,1Armalite (loaded) 3 detonators. 2 lbs of explosive and an assortment of ammunition.

Northern Ireland: Possible Settlements (GEN 79(73) 5) 
The purpose of tomorrow’s meeting is to consider the basis of our 
strategy in fundamental terms, i. e. to decide whether the direction in which the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is moving is the right direction (if only in default of any better course), or whether we ought to try to find some wholly new angle of approach. For this purpose a possible way of ordering the discussion might be as follows:(1) 
Is the Secretary of State right to rule out the three courses indicated in paragraph 2? I suspect that the answer is yes, if only because the first two - reunification and independence would be too drastic and irreversible to contemplate in present circumstances, while the third - re-drawing the border would not necessarily provide a permanent solution of the problem and would also entail (as would the other two courses) a price, in terms of violence and disorder which we ought not to contemplate paying at the present time. 
(2) 
If so, is the list of five options in paragraph 3 an exhaustive description of the courses which remain open to us? Again the answer is probably yes. But if anybody sees any other solution, this is the moment at which he should say so. 
(3) We need to consider the five options in the light of:(i) 
the current eruption of Protestant violence which is now at least as serious as IRA intransigence and if we cannot bring it under control, may eventually precipitate a civil war in the Province which, so long as it lasted, would make any kind of constitutional settlement, almost regardless of its content, impossible to achieve; 
(ii) 
the timing of a settlement in relation to the next General Election. 
If we assume, for the purposes of argument, 
that this takes place in the autumn of 1974, only 18 months remain to us in which to restore acceptable conditions of political existence in Northern Ireland. Even in

NORTHERN IRELAND. WEEKLY INTELIGENCE REPORT: 9 FEBRUARY 1973 GENERAL 
1. The high level of violence in BELFAST has continued during the past week, though in contrast LONDONDERRY has been quiet. Bombing attacks have increased, particularly in the rural areas. There have been three rocket launcher attacks and one other incident, at the BROADWAY post in BELFAST, which appears to have been an unsuccessful RL attack. One rocket hit a Saracen killing one soldier and wounding three others. 
2. The direct cause of the Protestant violence on 7 February, to which thefeeling of Protestant resentment and frustration at the continued Provisional activity contributed, was the arrest of two UDA/UVF members following the bomb attack on a Catholic bus. (Neither of the two are in fact suspected of being implicated in the attack). The strike and the protest marches were described by CRAIG as a ’show of strength’. 
3. These two arrests were followed on 9 February by the arrest of seven other BELFAST men with UVF or similar connections 
including the Red Hand Commando leader against whom a 
charge will be brought. There has been no immediate reaction to these fresh arrests other than a meeting called by CRAIG to consider the position.

NOTE OF A MEETING IN STORMONT CASTLE ON 9 FEBRUARY 1973 AT 4 PM 
Secretary of State Sir William Nield Mr David Howell 
Mr T Roberts Mr R C Stevens 
Mr Brian Faulkner Mr Phelim O’Neill Mr Inn Paisley Mr Vivian Simpson 
The Secretary of State thanked his visitors for giving him this opportunity for seeing them all together. He said that he attached great importance to the meeting and had cancelled several engagements in England to attend. 
Mr Faulkner said that he spoke for all the delegation inasmuch as they all attached great importance to the meeting. They were seeing him jointly and equally: it was no one person’s delegation, they were simply seeing him as the leaders of the four parties in the Northern Ireland Parliament who wanted a continuance of the constitutional position within the United Kingdom. Mr Faulkner explained that on Tuesday he had contacted the others present, plus Mr Craig, and on Wednesday all those present had jointly decided to see the Secretary of State 
- Mr Craig had not replied to the request. Mr Faulkner 
handed the Secretary of State a statement which he and the other three party leaders intended to give as a press hand-out. (Annex A) 
Mr Faulkner said that he was asking the Secretary of State for acrossthe-board action to bring an early end to violence. He would support all reasonable measures which the Secretary of State took and if HMG acted upon their advice, the delegation would severally and jointly give support to any new security initiatives. Mr Faulkner also asked that the Secretary of State on behalf of HMG should reaffirm the constitutional position of Northern Ireland within the Union. Both Dr Paisley and Mr Simpson repeated Mr Faulkner’s point that a reassurance about the Union was necessary. The Secretary of State explained that the best assurance was HMG’s continuing guarantee of a border poll.

We believe that the community, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, is calling above all else for an early end to violence and the removal of fear throughout the land. 
We urge that whatever measures are necessary to bring this about should be implemented forthwith and impartially without any regard for political considerations inside or outside the United Kingdom. 
We pledge full support for such measures. 
We further ask Her Majesty’s Government for a renewed assurance that the wish of the people of Northern Ireland to maintain their position within the United Kingdom has their full support.

I greatly appreciate the coming together of the leaders of the four parties in the Northern Ireland Parliament committed to the maintenance of the constitutional position to express to me their united wish for an early end to violence and fear and for the impartial implementation of all measures necessary to bring about an end to these evils from what quarter they may come. I assured the leaders of these parties that HMG will do all in their power to fulfil these objectives. I reaffirmed the firm intentions of HMG to hold a poll of the people of Northern Ireland on March 8 on the constitutional position of the province, and I renewed the categorical assurances of HMG that Northern Ireland will remain part of the United Kingdom so long as that is the wish if the majority of her people.

The Leader of the Opposition and Mr. Merlyn Rees came 
to see the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the Prime Minister’s room at the House of Commons on Thursday, 8 February 1973 at 4.10 p.m. 
Mr. Wilson said that he had asked for this meeting 
in order that he and Mr. Rees might be briefed on the current situation in Northern Ireland. They did not think it necessary or desirable from their side that a statement that the meeting had taken place should be put out; but they would not object if the Prime Minister wished to issue a statement that the meeting had taken place at their request. 
The Prime Minister indicated that he saw no 
need for a statement to be made. Mr. Wilson said that the meeting was understood to 
be on Privy Counsellor terms. The Prime Minister invited Mr. Whitelaw to bring 
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Rees up to date on the situation in Northern Ireland. 
The Secretary of State said that in the previous week 
the situation in Northern Ireland had moved into a new phase, with assassinations taking place on a much greater and indiscriminate scale. 
The security forces had built 
up a dossier on Protestant extremists, and he had instructed that, in the event of an occurrence like the recent blowing up of a Catholic bus, the area concerned should be searched and identified extremists lifted. Following this incident, a search had been conducted, and six men had been lifted. 
At that stage the police could pin nothing specific on them; but he had decided to detain

SECRETARY OF STATE FCS/73/12 Northern Ireland - Possible Settlements As you may know I shall be away in West Africa until 
9 February. I have read with interest your memorandum Gen 79(73)5) on possible settlements in Northern Ireland. Since I understand that there may be some ministerial discussion of it next week, you may care to have a note of my preliminary views. 2. 
I reject integration primarily because I believe that the 
addition of Irish politics to Westminster will wreck our Parliamentary system as it has very nearly done before. 3. 
NORTHERN IRELAND I support devolution and believe we shall need to face up 
to a plan for Scotland and Wales, including some responsibility for legislation, although the bills to be proposed locally ight have to leave the last word with Westminster. 
4. I believe therefore that the solution lies in an Assembly 
with carefully defined fields of legislative power. 5. 
But I think these not necessarily be completed in one jump. 
Could we design a clearly defined field of legislation which will give responsible people enough to do: agricultural/ environmental/industrial legislation for example, while reserving some others e.g. taxation/security for further consideration?

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 070700 TO 080700 HRS FEB 73 GENERAL 1. 
There were 110 shooting incidents 78 of which involved SF (Belfast 
99/75, Londonderry 2/1, Border 1/1, Rural 8/1). There were 2 rocket attacks (both ineffective) and 3 explosions (all rural areas). There were 2 SF casualties (one VSI), and 8 civilian casualties (5 dead). The 5 dead are made up of 3 gunmen hit by SF (bodies in hospital), a fireman killed in Sandy Row and a body thought to be that of the Protestant reported as missing (abducted) in yesterdays sitrep. 
2. In Belfast the call by leaders of loyalists for general civil unrest 
received widespread support. In Londonderry, as was anticipated, the strike produced noticeable closures in industry and commerce and in the country the atmosphere was tense particularly in urban areas. In areas outside Belfast the majority of industrial closures was due to power failure rather than to active support for the strike. 
3. Belfast was the scene of most of the days activity. There was 
picqueting of RUC stations by UDA/Tartans and some check points were erected but removed by SF. 
Shooting was widespread particularly in New Lodge 
(following rioting in the afternoon), Ardoyne (at the Louisa St OP), in Sandy Row (where a fireman was killed) and in East Belfast (where 2 
gunmen were hit). Shooting also occurred in the Falls (during the funeral of the IRA killed in New Lodge 3/4 Feb), in the Clonard (where SF claim 2 hits - one body in RVH) and across the interface in the Ardoyne.

They were dispersed with the firing of 11 PVC rounds (used for the first time and found to be very effective). 
In a border incident at Clady 3 
hits were claimed by SF. BELFAST 4. 
SF were involved in 75 of the 99 shooting.incidents. It was a day of 
general civil unrest resulting from the call by loyalist leaders for reaction to the signing of the first two ICOs on Protestants. Intimidation took place to support this unrest. There were power cuts at various times and most schools, factories and shops were closed for the day. By 1500 hrs the main RUC stations were picqueted by UDA/Tartans. In the main they were peaceful but a group of 1200 outside Willowfield RUC station got out of control and attacked the RC church and the priest’s house next it. The crowd dispersed after 11 PVC baton rounds were fired at them. There was considerable Tartan and UDA activity throughout the day including the erection of check points on roads in Protestant areas throughout Belfast and the burning of shops and houses. A protracted exchange of fire took place between SF and gunmen during the afternoon in the Tmplemore Ave/Beechfield Street and the Ballymacarrett areas of East Belfast. Pte HALL of 1 GREEN HOWARDS received GSW to the back and is VSI.2 hitshare: claimed against gunmen in these incidental(2 bodies recovered). 2.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND PROFESSOR LAWRENCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ELECTORAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE, HELD AT STORMONT CASTLE ON 6 FEBRUARY 1973. 
I. FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF NORTHERN IRELAND 
The Secretary of State felt that the major problem was how power could effectively be shared among the various interest groups in Northern Ireland. Professor Lawrence thought that the viable choices were:- 
(1) A system in which there was a coalition executive comprising members drawn by proportional representation and in which the life of each assembly was for a fixed term. 
He recognised the difficulties of 
forming such a Cabinet when such divergent views had to be accommodated. Moreover, even with proportional representation, there would still be a permanent Protestant majority. 
(2) A reversion to a system in which the majority party formed the executive, but in which there was power sharing in committees. 
Such 
proposal would not adequately deal with the problem, however, because final decisions would still rest with the Cabinet. 
(3) A local government system which would give Northern Ireland comparatively little legislative power. 
A major difficulty here would be that 
Westminster would have to include Northern Ireland legislation in its already over-crowded time-table. 
Professor Lawrence felt that the sole aim of extremist members of both communities was the elimination of the other and that, ironically, the Government might be prolonging the current problem because the extremists knew that the situation would never be allowed to deteriorate to the point where mutual fear forced them to co-operate with each other. 
One possible solution might 
be a constituent assembly elected by proportional representation charged with making recommendations to the Secretary of State for a new system of Government which would be adopted if he found them acceptable. to secure the co-operation of all sides for this proposal. 
State thought that there was merit in this proposal, but only if those so elected were also responsible for making their recommendations work. 
It was imperative, however, The Secretary of 
Professor 
Lawrence’s proposal had the advantage that it would be possible to see what the assembly would be like before being committed to accepting its recommendations.

Mr Steele Mr Whalley 
The Secretary of State met a group of people representing political interests in the centre of Northern Ireland on Friday, 2 February. burden of the various proposals put forward was that the group were concerned about the development of the centre ground and hoped that circumstances would emerge which would make it possible for a centre group to develop.

They were concerned that a If the

The Irish Dimension should be seen to be inter-parliamentary Mr Bailie reinforced the dangers of appearing to go back 
on the initiative which had led to Direct Rule. It was clear that the last twelve 
months had been a traumatic experience for the people of Northern Ireland, the pain of which would only be lessened if some viable machinery for power-sharing were now set up. 
The Secretary of State said that he understood the rumour and 
the speculation about deals with Mr Faulkner, but he thought it fair to point out that his colleagues had not yet come to the point of decision about their proposals for Northern Ireland. 
He hoped that the centre group would appreciate this, but 
they should realise the extent to which elections to an Assembly might be affected by the existence of party machines. 
In a democratic election the result could 
never be guaranteed and the Government could do nothing to alter the result if the Unionists were to emerge with a majority of seats in the ssembly.

DRAFT STATMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN RELATED - 
1st FEBRUARY, 1973. 
With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a statement. Following the spate of sectarian killings towards the end of last year a joint Task Force of the RUC and RMP was set up in December to investigate and prevent sectarian murders. In the first three weeks of January there was a marked decline in the number of murders and of murder attempts. Two people were murdered in this period, one Catholic and one Protestant. Bad as this was, it was a marked improvement and much of the credit should be given to the Task Force, which was responsible for the arrest of three men who have been charged with three murders committed last year. 
However there has now been a fresh and appalling wave of murders. During the last four days five people have been murdered, one of them a mere boy, and there have also been cases of attempted murder. And now this morning at about 8 o’clock a grenade was thrown in Kingsway Park on the east side of Belfast at a bus which was carring men to their work in Dundonald. 
whom three are still in hospital. 
On behalf of Her Majesty’s Government I would like to express deep regret and extend our sympathy to the families of those killed and injured in these recent bestial incidents. 
One man was killed and nine others injured, of

Annex A to A/BR/30/1/MO4 Dated 28 February 1973 
HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING 28 FEBRUARY 1973 
1. The general level of violence throughout the Province this week is similar 
to that of the previous period. Two members of the SF have been killed and 22 wounded or injured, compared with 2 killed and 10 wounded or injured last week. There have, however, been slightly fewer shooting incidents, 111 compared with 149. Two boys, one 10 and one 13, have been killed but there have been no sectarian murders (4 last week). There has been one rocket attack (2 last week) and only a slight increase in the number of bomb explosions, 17 compared with 13. At the same time the SF have arrested 80 known or suspected terrorists and recovered 35 firearms, 2,958 rounds of ammunition and the contents of 4 bomb factories. These statistics are generally satisfactory. There is increasing evidence to suggest that the Security Forces are progressively diminishing the ability of extremist organisations and their supporters to influence political events. Nonetheless one major incident by either side could easily be the cause of a rapid escalation in violence. Intimidation continues at a very high level, is probably increasing, and may become the most important factor in the security equation. 
2. On the credit side, there has been a marked thaw in relations between the 
SF and the local civilians in the Creggan Estate, Londonderry and in the Andersonstown area of Belfast. In addition there has been a significant decrease in UDA activity in East Belfast since the events of 7 February 1973. 
3. Of the 80 people arrested this week by the SF, 68 were known Provisionals 
and 9 of these were officers. The arrests included a volunteer who is known to have committed armed robbery on a train in Dundalk on 20 February 1973, and 
wanted in connection with a sectarian murder. The SF 
recovered 21 IRA firearms and the contents of 3 bomb factories, in one of which there was a Pye Westminster Radio; 119 detonators of which at least 17 originated in the Republic; 20 lbs of explosive, 3 blast bombs and other bomb making equipment. One shot was fired at an SF patrol in Newry on Tuesday, one shot was returned. A hit was reported and a 13 year old boy subsequntly died in hospital. Investigations are continuing. 
4. and 5. 
The SF have arrested 6 members of the UDA, 5 suspected members of the UVF, Red Hand Group, who has been charged with armed robbery and 
is also suspected of sectarian murders. The SF have recovered 14 Protestant firearms and the contents of one UVF bomb factory. 
One soldier was killed and 5 were wounded by IRA gunmen during the week. 
Another soldier died as a result of the injuries he received in East Belfast on 5 October 1972 when a brick, thrown through his windscreen by the UDA, caused his car to crash. He is the first soldier to have been killed as a result of extreme Protestant violence. An RUC constable was killed and another was severely wounded when their car was ambushed at Cranagh Bridge near the South East corner of Lough Neagh. Seven other SF casualties were caused in various incidents involving explosions which are described later and 10 other SF minor casualties were caused in stoning or assault incidents.

23 February, 1973 Ulster Defence Regiment minute of 27 February. 
The Prime inister has seen your Secretary of State’s The issues were also discussed very 
briefly at the beginning of the GEN 79 meeting this afternoon. The Prime Minister and his colleagues on the GEN 79 
Committee agreed with the proposals put forward by your Secretary of State both for the recruitment of women to the U.D.R. and for not proceeding at the present time with recruitment for full-time operational service in the U.D.R. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland indicated that it should be possible to include, in the legislation now being prepared to give effect to the Diplock recommendations, a provision which would allow the recruitment of women to the U.D.R. 
I am sending copies of this to Alexander (Foreign 
and Commonwealth Office), Owen (Lord Chancellor’s Office), Platt (Northern Ireland Office), Angel (Home Office), Rucker (Office of the Lord President), Warren (Chief Whip’s Office), Hetherington (Law Officers Department) and Norbury (Cabinet Office).

ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT At the GEN 79 meeting on 29th January, the question of 
amending legislation to allow full-time operational service and the recruitment of women in the UDR was discussed in the context of the forthcoming legislation on Diplock and other security matters. I have now been able to give further consideration to the policy aspects of these proposals; this minute is to let you know my views. 
Recruitment of Women 2. 
The UDR Act 1969 precludes the recruitment of women into 
the Regiment. However, in view of the increasing use of women in terrorist activities by the IRA (and possibly other extremist organisations) it is operationally important that the UDR, when manning check points, should be able to search women who, at present, mostly pass unchecked. This requirement could be met by the establishment of a section commander and 10 women in every UDR company to provide two female searchers on duty each night. Assuming that these part-time women would undertake duty one night in every five, a total of about 700 posts would be needed, at an annual cost in due course of about £0.25m. 
3. This is a requirement which can be met effectively only 
by the UDR. We are already making available as many WRAC as we can to operate as searchers with the regular forces, and will continue to do so. The RUC reserve has recently started to recruit women searchers: but searching is only one aspect of a wide range of duties which would fall upon these police women and there would also be problems of control in placing RUC reservists under the command of UDR patrols and difficulty in ensuring that searchers were available at the right time and place. Recruitment of women to the UDR is not expected to prejudice RUC recruiting; because the RUC have different and more exacting entry requirements, the UDR is likely to appeal to a different section of the population, and an estimate has been made that about 400 could be recruited within 6 months from the start of recruitment.

You asked for material to enable the Prime Minister to adopt a more positive approach in reply to possible supplementaries to Mr Duffy’s Question on firearms this afternoon. 
I enclose some notes which we suggest should replace the second and third sections ("Additional controls" and "What sort of controls" of the notes for supplementaries which we sent you earlier. Could I draw your attention specifically to our advice that no mention be made of the proposed general power to order a firearm to be handed in to the police in certain circumstances. This will be a general power which we think we should have available in case the situation in Northern Ireland deteriorates drastically. But to mention the power in reply to a supplementary without a detailed explanation would be likely to alarm Protestant opinion unnecessarily. 
I am sending a copy of this letter and the enclosure to Ronnie Custis.

Ministers would need to have the complete draft by next Monday, 5th March; to discuss it at GEN 79 on Wednesday, 7th March; to have a first discussion in Cabinet on 8th or 9th March and a second discussion (which will surely be necessary) on 13th or 14th March in order that it might go to the printers by 16th March. 3. 
I doubt whether this timetable is practicable. If publication were a 
week later, that would make much more sense in terms of Ministerial discussions. And it might have the additional advantage of enabling us to devote a little more time to the projected meeting with Mr. Lynch (or whoever emerges victorious from the Election in the Republic. We have hitherto assumed that Mr. Lynch will win, probably easily, and will therefore be free to visit London almost at once. But this now seems more doubtful). 4. 
But, even if we give ourselves an extra week, it will be important not 
to allow the Northern Ireland Office more than one or two days’ grace at the most in circulating the complete draft. Otherwise, the benefit of the additional interval before publication will be lost.

NORTHERN IRELAND LEGISLATION As I cannot attend the meeting to consider 
GEN.79(73)10, may I let you have my views on one aspect which has major implications in the taxation field. 
2. It has been understood, from talks between 
the Northern Ireland Office and the Treasury, that the constitutional plan would totally exclude certain matters from the proposed new assembly’s competence to legislate, though on other matters they would be able to legislate with consent in some cases or even without it in others. The present paper does not refer explicitly to the first class of case, but it seems to me essential that there should be some matters on which the assembly should not have even the potential ability to make their own laws. 
3. Our membership of the EEC would reinforce the need 
to retain in Westminster total responsibility for matters affecting external trade, but in addition I am particularly concerned that we should also retain our existing clear-cut responsibility in matters of taxation. Even though any

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 260700 TO 270700 HRS FEBRUARY 1973 GENERAL 1. 
There were 16 shooting incidents of which 15 involved SF. (Belfast 12/11, 
Londonderry 1/1, Border -/-, Rural 3/3). A soldier received GSW to the arm (not listed) in a shooting incident in Belfast. There were 4 explosions 3 in Belfast, 1 in Newry). An 11 year old girl was hit by a bullet aimed 
at a SF patrol in Belfast and in Strabane a civilian driving past in a car was hit in a similar incident (neither are badly injured). 
BELFAST 2. 
The SF were involved in 11 of the 12 shooting incidents. There was 
1 minor SF casualty but no hits were claimed. At 1518 hrs 2 shots were fired at a patrol at the junction of Duncairn Gardens and Edlingham St in the New Lodge. There were no military casualties but a young girl (11 
- Prot) sustained minor GSW to the head. There were 3 explosions on 
the edge of the City Centre. At 1025 hrs 2 youths placed a 20-501b bomb in a garage at 77 King St at 1039 hrs the bomb exploded and started a fire which severely damaged the building. There were no casualties. At 1503 hours a 151b bomb exploded and caused minor damage to a shop in Hill St. There were no casualties because although no warning was given 2 men and 2 women had been seen planting the bomb. At 1524 hours a 10lb bomb caused slight damage to the Northern Ireland Cricket Club. No warning was given but there were no casualties. A total of 6 weapons (4 Prot and 2 RC), 3 radios and 1,000 rounds of ammunition were found. There were 6 arrests (5 RC and 1 Prot). 4 of these (RC) were rearrested by the RUC after they were released on bail at Crumlin Rd Courthouse. They were originally arrested in a planned operation on 17/18 Feb and included the Acting EO and a Volunteer in A Coy 2 Provo. 
LONDONDERRY 3. 
SF were involved in the 1 shooting incident (Shantallow). At 0731 hrs 
in a planned search in the Shantallow 50 Armalite cartridges and 30lbs of Gelamex were found by a search dog under a manhole cover. The Gelamex was booby trapped and exploded whilst being remotely recovered by an EOD operator. A single round struck a SF landrover in Shantallow.

Elections to a Northern Ireland Assembly (GEN 79(73) 11) 
In this memorandum the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland 
suggests that the choice should lie between two methods of election:(a) The single transferable vote (STV) in multi-member constituencies, the Westminster constituencies being used for this purpose. 
(b) The Party proportional system (PPS) used in the Federal German Republic, for which the existing Stormont constituencies would have to be used. 
He thinks that there is little to choose between the two systems; but, on balance, he favours the PPS. 2. 
It is impossible to calculate with any degree of certainty which system 
would produce the better results. But Annex A offers some sort of comparison under various headings. The main considerations are perhaps as follows:(i) In the conditions of Northern Ireland it is not certain that STV would work to the advantage of the moderates; it could have the reverse effect. PPS would at least have the virtue of producing an Assembly which should fairly accurately reflect the relative strengths of the Parties. 
(ii) STV might tend to encourage a multiplicity of Parties which,is the opposite of what is needed in Northern Ireland and, particularly when it came to forming an Executive, would be an adverse factor. PPS might work in the opposite direction. 
(But how, if at all, is 
this conclusion affected, in the Secretary of State’s judgment, by Mr. Craig’s declared intention to form a new ultra-Protestant Party? 
(iii) STV would mean that every member of the Assembly would be elected personally. 
It is arguable whether, in the Northern Ireland climate 
of corruption and intimidation, this would work for the good or not. PPS would imply that a large number of members, perhaps as high as half, would be drawn from Party lists - which might have the advantage of reinstating some good candidates who had been defeated in the election or some men of real ability who were willing to serve but not to stand for election. 
But, here again, we must 
reckon with the possibility that undesirable pressures might be brought to bear in the formation of Party lists.

Northern Ireland Legislation (GEN 79(73) 10) 
The Secretary of State is probably right to adopt the basic 
hypothesis that the 1920 distinction between "reserved" and "transferred" subjects should be maintained, subject to the essential proviso that law and order will be moved from the latter to the former category. On this assumption the main problem which he foresees, and seeks to resolve in this memorandum, is how to deal with legislation by the Northern Ireland Assembly on a "transferred" matter when it touches on a "reserved" matter, whether because it is convenient that the Assembly should include in legislation a provision on a specific matter within the "reserved" field or because local legislation unavoidably has to involve a "reserved" matter. For example, legislation dealing with a "transferred" subject may have to include penalty clauses or to impose duties on the police, both being "law and order" subjects, which fall within the "reserved" category. Mr. Whitelaw’s solution is that the Constitutional Bill should provide for the device of the Secretary of State’s "consent" (which would not be given, in the foreseeable future, for legislation dealing with the franchise, elections, the police, etc. ); that the Secretary of State should be required to lay before both Houses of Parliament at Westminster, under the Negative Resolution procedure, any measure, subject to his consent, which deals substantially with a "reserved" matter; and that it should be left to his discretion whether any measure containing minor and unimportant "reserved" provisions should be similarly laid. (He prefers this to the alternative course of constituting a Select Committee of both Houses to consider whether Northern Ireland legislation involving any "reserved" elements should be laid before Westminster. In view of the scope which a Select Committee would provide for troublemaking and the additional burden which it would impose on the Government if a majority was to be ensured, the Secretary of State is surely right on this point?). 
this procedure he is particularly concerned with measures touching upon a "reserved" matter where there is a danger that the vires of the Northern Ireland legislation may be called into question; and he is also anxious to avoid a situation in which Assembly legislation has to be held up pending

Northern Ireland: Human Rights Provisions (GEN 79(73) 9) 
The Secretary of State acknowledges that both Northern Ireland 
opinion and the Opposition at Westminster agree that there should be a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, although they appear to have different views on what the Bill should be and do. He is not in favour of a Bill of Rights as such a Bill is commonly conceived, i. e. a guarantee of fundamental human rights based on, say, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the European Convention of Human Rights. He prefers a more explicit if more limited attack, directed against discrimination. 
The argument is 
contained in the annex to the memorandum. A broadly based Bill 2. 
The Government of Ireland Act 1920 provides that laws shall not be 
made or executive powers exercised in such a way as to discriminate on religious grounds. The Prevention of Incitement to Hatred Act; the Acts on Fair Employment Practices and the anti-discriminatory clauses in Government contracts; and the Offices of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and Commissioner for Complaints 
- all these exist to 
provide protection against discrimination. But the Secretary of State accepts that they command little respect or confidence in the minority community; and he is surely right in saying that the main need is to ensure that whatever protection we provide is clearly enforceable and effective. In paragraph 6 of the Annex he examines the difficulties involved in a Bill listing fundamental rights and based on the European Convention, on the Constitution of the United States, or on Canadian legislation. There is considerable force in his objections to a Bill of this sort. But it is arguable whether they should be regarded as conclusive against a generalised Bill of Rights, if there seemed likely to be decisive political opinion in Northern Ireland and among the opposition in legislating on these lines. 
It is true that many of the rights which would appear in the Bill 
are already covered by Common Law (which we ought not needlessly to call in question); that the enforcement of basic freedoms would involve recourse to the Courts with resultant delay and expense for the litigants; that a Bill would have to bind the United Kingdom Government (since they would be

the telephone for the next meeting of GEN 79 on Wednesday, 28th February at 4. 00 pm (at No.10). The meeting will have before it three memoranda which, I understand, your Secretary of State hopes to circulate tomorrow. 
I am sending copies of this letter to the Private Secretaries to the 
other Ministers invited to attend the meeting - the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (although I understand it is likely that the Chancellor will not attend), the Secretary of State for Defence, the Home Secretary, the Lord President, the Attorney General and the Chief Whip; and to Mark Forrester at No. 10.

22nd February, 1973 The Defence Secretary has been considering proposals to 
reinforce Northern Ireland for the Plebiscite on 8th March and the need for precautionary measures following the subsequent publication of the White Paper. The Prime Minister will wish to know his conclusions. 
THE PLEBISCITE For the Plebiscite, the GOC has asked that two more units 
should be deployed to Northern Ireland. These will be found from the UK and the units concerned will be warned on 26th February and will deploy on 3/4 March. In reply to press inquiries we shall say that the two units are being sent as a precautionary measure in case trouble arises during the polling and to assist the RUC in protecting polling stations. 
THE WHITE PAPER The publication date is not yet settled, but we are assuming 
that it will take place 2 - 3 weeks after the Plebiscite. It is not proposed to deploy more units to Northern Ireland in advance of publication but, against the possibility that publication will be followed by a strong upsurge of violence particularly in the hard Protestant areas in North and East Belfast, it is proposed to put 2 units at 24 hours notice, and a further 6 units at 72 hours notice, from the day of publication of the White Paper. These plans will involve cancelling arrangements already made for training overseas; the units concerned (2 in UK, one in BAOR) will be told about this on 26th February. But although we shall tell all commanding officers in confidence at that time, none of the 8 units will be formally alerted for possible duty in Northern Ireland earlier than 6 days before the White Paper is published. At that stage the fact that we will be holding units on stand-by will become public knowledge. This is inevitable and not necessarily undesirable. In answer to press inquiries we shall take the line that it is only sensible to have a number of units at short notice at the time the White Paper is published. We shall not of course give any detail about the numbers and identity of the units concerned or their state of readiness.

Northern Ireland The Ministers taking part in the Chequers meeting will have received 
three memoranda by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland: "A New Executive" (GEN 79(73) 6); "Council of Ireland" (GEN 79(73) 7); and "Northern Ireland Representation at Westminster" (GEN 79(73) 8). They will also have had a memorandum by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, reporting preliminary discussions with the Irish Government on a Council of Ireland; and a Special Assessment by the JIC on how much further the Irish Government might be prepared to move against the IRA after the Irish General Election. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland hopes that you will agree to discuss the Executive first. The Executive 2. 
It will be important to distinguish between what should be said 
in the White Paper (and the constitutional Bill) and what we think might in practice be the best way of forming the Executive. In paragraph 1(a) to 1(d) the Secretary of State examines four ways in which an Executive might be constituted:(a) 
’X’ places (say two or three)in the Executive to be reserved for 
"Catholics". (b) The majority Party to have posts proportionate to their numbers 
in the Assembly, the remaining posts to be filled by the Secretary of State after consultation with the Leaders of the other Parties. (c) 
All Parties with more than ’X’ seats to have a right to representation 
in the Executive if they so wish. (d) An Executive to be formed through the election by the Assembly of a 
panel of Heads of Departments, the election requiring, say, a 75 per cent majority. 3. 
The Secretary of State thinks that (a), (b) and (c) should be rejected 
for reasons which differ in detail in each case but all derive from the basic difficulty of accommodating a minority which is sectarian in character but has no organised political form or structure on which we can build. He

MILITARY INFORMATION POLICY WORKING PARTY REVIEW NO 15 
GENERAL 1. 
Review No 15 deals with the months of November an December 1972. In this 
period, the main Republican effort was directed to propaganda designed to discredit security force actions, notably Army operations in Belfast; possible UDR/UDA links and the SAS. This anti-Army campaign reached a peak on November 20 with an attack on the Army by certain priests. For the first time, Communist bloc weapons appeared in Northern Ireland 
- Russian RPG-7 rocket 
launchers used by the Provisional IRA. Protestant extremists avoided military activity which risked a clash with the security forces. One arson attack in Lenadoon against Catholic houses was the most sensational effort. Though threats were muted, preparations for violent action continued. A special mixed RUC-Army task force was set up in answer to public hcrror at the increasing numbers of sectarian murders. IRA and extremist Protestant bomb explosions in the Irish Republic led to a new tough mood in the Irish Government. The IRA Chief of Staff, John Stephenson, was arrested, sentenced to 6 months jail and embarked on an abortive hunger strike. New legislation against the IRA was passed by the Dail to the sound of bomb blasts. Only minor IRA men have been arrested under the new powers but IRA men have gone underground in the South. Two Soviet journalists, Victor Louis, Moscow correspondent of the London Evening News, and Alexandr Efremov, London correspondent of Komsomolskaya Pravada, paid simultaneous visits to Dublin; as did Ernest Mandel, head of the Fourth International. In December, an Englishman, reportedly an intelligence agent, was charged under the Republic’s Official Secrets Act. The year ended with the opening shots from the Republican side against the White Paper, with the Irish Independent’s Jaes Kelly weeping crocodile tears about how it would displease the Protestants. 
REPUBLICANS 2. 
As recorded in the last Review, the successful security force operations 
against the Provisional IRA in the post-MOTORMAN period created little of the popular resentment on which Republican propaganda feeds. This contrasted with the resentment and propaganda which resulted from the 1971 campaign against the IRA. In November, Republican activists launched a number of press stunts accusing the Army of harassment of the Catholic population with the aim of diminishing activity which was hurting the IRA. The IRA and their sympathisers continued their character assassination of Brigadier Kitson and the GOC. The credibility of Army PR remained a top target. The SDLP, particularly Paddy Devlin and Ivan dooper, made much of the running. 
3. Three such exercises can be singled out. In each case the protagonists were 
people who would be convincing to people with no local knowledge. a. 
One such exercise involved a Mr and Mrs Turner of Ballymurphy. The 
husband, a former Royal Marine commando, married to a Catholic girl, made a series of allegations of harassment, principally against 1 PARA. These were printed in the Sunday Press and also by The Guardian, whose reporter, Derek Brown, was convinced by Turner’s apparently neutral background. 39 Inf Bde made a full investigation of Turner and found that he was not so

ANNEX A TO 240 G DATED 13 FEB 73 
CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT 1. THE ARMY The discrediting of the Army, along with the RUC and all concerned in 
maintaining law and order, has been a prime aim of Republican propaganda since about mid-1971. We refer loosely to such a campaign as "IRA propaganda" because the only people who stand to gain by it are the IRA. In reality much of what is alleged arises out of anti-British or anti-authoritarian sentiment not directly linked to support of the IRA. Nevertheless it is the IRA who stimulate and direct popular attitudes so as to bring pressure to bear to curtail effective counter-terrorist methods. In so far as Army activity to diminish the power of the IRA bears heavily on the civil population part of the campaign is self-generating, since people who resent our activities are never slow to report their sufferings, real or imagined. Honor Tracy described the special Irish talent in this sphere in these words: 
The charitable might say that the Irish tend not to minimise their sufferings; the candid that they are shocking old cry babies. If anyone lays a finger on them the world must hear of it with embellishment. And like children they believe in their own fantasies Furthermore, nothing that happens, no action of troops or police, relates in any way to anything done by themselves. Nothing is ever their fault, nor do they ever do wrong. 
Because the world at large is unaccustomed to this style of behaviour, complaints and allegations by Irishmen against the Army are apt to shock and disturb and even the most outrageous stories such as the activities of "Army assassination squads" create doubts and unease amongst those brought up in the belief that "there is no smoke without a fire". 
2. The IRA are aware that their own stock is low, even amongst their erst- 
while supporters, and propaganda overtly supporting terrorism or directly attributable to the organisation has small impact. Consequently they attach greater importance to front organisations such as Sinn Fein and Republican clubs, whose statements on news events are, however, mainly directed at Republican audiences and fuel Catholic grievances. The greatest importance is attached to organisations which claim to be fighting for justice and civil rights. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and the Association for Legal Justice are particularly active, the latter being a propaganda/ pressure group that has made effective use of its "justice" cover to inject stories alleging brutality etc into the British and foreign media. 
3. and October - 
Throughout the 3 months following Operation MOTORMAN - August, September the IRA’s attempts to generate public pressure for the removal 
of the Army from the Republican areas of West Belfast achieved little. People in these areas remembered too vividly how unpleasant life had been under Provisional IRA domination; they appreciated the reduction in the level of violence; and as our intelligence improved and we arrested many of the men who had intimidated and bullied, they acknowledged that our methods were evidently effective. Three factors seem to have combined during November to resurrect the full-scale campaign of anti-Army propaganda that has been muted since the introduction of Direct Rule.

Extract from ’The Immaculate Deception’ 
Profile Nine (on Father Desmond Wilson) in Rosita Sweetman’s book ’On Our Knees’ (Pan Special, early 1972). 
Father Wilson’s Views Prior to Direct Rule ’The effects of violence on this community though have been disastrous. 
Apathy is the end result. It’s terribly difficult to get people going. But the level of viciousness and brutality that the British Army has introduced into this area has brought in standards of violence of which the people had no experience. 
’The British Army is operating completely unsupervised in this area. 
They’re the authority. You have them roaring up and down in their Saracens day and night. They sit on the roadside waiting for people to come along and then simply snatch them off the streets. They bring them in and ask the RUC then have they got anything on them. These are perfectly innocent people being taken away for two days’ questioning, usually a thumping, and nobody in the world knows where they are for those two days. 
’You might have thought in a situation like this you’d have the Church 
listening to the complaints people make about the Army, yet the Church has never said anything, not one single thing. You might wonder why they didn’t put observers in every single area where there have been complaints about British Army brutality, but would you believe that they didn’t even think of this? They just couldn’t care less, and yet the people here are living with the fear that if they go outside their front door they are liable to be picked up by the British Army - "suspect".’......

APPENDIX 2 TO ANNEX A TO 240 G DATED 13 FEB 73 
EMBARGO UNTIL 31.00 a.m, MONDAY 20TH NOVEMBER, 1972 
A group of priests working in Belfast have issued the following statements 1. 
We are Catholic priests working in Belfast. We have condemned violence 
in the past when it was carried out by private citizens. We cannot now remain silent in the face of the violence now being used by the British Army, particularly in the poorer Catholic areas. 
2. No military victory could justify this campaign of attacking a civilian 
population. Innocent and unarmed civilians, regardless of sex or age, are being shot by soldiers who are in and out of uniform. Homes are raided over and over again at all hours of the day and night. People are arrested daily in their homes, places of work, social clubs and on the streets. Many of those arrested are subjected to beatings and inhuman and degrading treatment. The campaign affects all the people in areas saturated by the Army. They suffer from curfews, interrupted sleep, inability to get to work and loss of recreational facilities. The consequent damage to family life is intolerable. 
3. This campaign of violence by the regular army becomes all the more intoler- 
able when it is claimed that there are not enough soldiers to protect the population in other parts of the city from murder gangs. The Army must be made to recognize that its first duty is to protect ALL innocent lives. 
4. Redress for these injustices has been refused even when full details have 
been given of military violence against people who have no involvement in any political movement. Indeed, if they were so involved, they ought not to be treated in such a way. People in the depressed areas of Belfast feel bereft of the protection of the law. 
5. It is our determination to do everything in our power to help the poor 
people who, without the benefit of the vast resources of propaganda available to the Army and the British Government, feel helpless in the face of the violence being used against them. It is a charge on our conscience to relieve them of this burden. We intend to make known, in every place in which we can do so, the consequences of this campaign, and especially in those countries which are soon to be our partners in the Common Market. 
e believe that the truth of 
what is happening must be told. We also propose immediately to organize direct non-violent action in the worst affected areas and to be present in some numbers with the suffering people. 
6. Violence by private citizens which takes away human rights, is immoral. 
Violence is no less abominable when it is carried out by the Forces under the control of the Government. We cannot be expected to be silent in the face of either.

ANEX B TO 240 G DATED 13 
INFORMATION POLICY - GUIDANCE TO UNITS ON OUR CAMPAIGN FEB 73 1. The Provisional IRA, by attempting to achieve unification by brute force, 
have posed a threat to society that can only be countered by a security force presence in those areas that harbour IRA men. The process of removing gunmen and bombers from the scene involves searches, questioning people, patrolling and other military activities that are bound to prove irksome to innocent people in the affected areas. Since Operation MOTORMAN these measures have reduced the capacity for violence of the Provisionals very considerably so that their proven effectiveness is adequate justification to all reasonable people. 
2. Just because the measures have been effective, IRA sympathisers and 
propagandists have attempted to misrepresent all security force activities as "harassment", "brutality" or "discrimination". The purpose of such allegations is to bring pressure for our withdrawal from Republican areas and enable the Provisionals to recover and intensify their violence. 
3. Our operations in Republican areas would obviously be reduced if the 
main threat to security was removed. The onus is on the Provisionals to free Catholics from suffering and inconvenience by abandoning their violent campaign. Catholics can help themselves by assisting the security forces to rid their areas of terrorists.

INFORMATION POLICY - GUIDANCE TO UNITS ON OUR ACTIONS 
AGAINST EXTREME MILITANT PROTESTANTS 1. 
13 FEB 73 UVF violence and illegal activities by other Protestant groups receive 
exactly the same treatment as IRA activities. Successful arms and explosives finds in Protestant areas (and indeed full-scale street battles against armed extremists) are evidence of our determination to deal impartially with violence regardless of its origin or motive. 
2. If for the time being an illegal organisation refrains from attacks on 
security forces, the Army’s duties in aid of the Civil Power in respect of such an organisation are mainly to support the RUC in preventing or detecting sectarian violence or other criminal activity. (Our policy towards the Official IRA since that faction called off its violent campaign illustrates this.) 
3. Murders of innocent Catholics attributed to the UVF and other Protestant 
extremists have sickened the great mass of decent Ulster Protestants. We are concerned to isolate from public sympathy all who use terror for political or sectarian ends, and to encourage people to come forward anonymously and confidentially with information.

ANNEX D TO 240 G DATED 13 FEB 73 
INFORMATION POLICY - GUIDANCE TO UNITS ON OUR ROLE AS AN 1. Protection of the lives and property of isolated families in areas 
containing hostile elements is top priority in all military planning and actions. The number and wide distribution of such families - whether they be Catholic. in East Belfast or Protestants in Fermanagh 
- makes the task 
extremely difficult. The reluctance on the part of some threatened families to seek security force assistance is another handicap and the very nature of intimidation imposes special problems in its prevention. Nevertheless, the Army is determined to do all in its power to protect those who are threatened and to bring to justice those who threaten. 
2. Our task is made more difficult by the continued violence of the 
Provisional. IRA and extreme militant Protestants which, left unchecked, would lead directly to civil war, and which requires that a considerable body of troops, that might otherwise be providing protection to vulnerable families, must be committed to counter-insurgency operations. The suggestion (by CESA’s Chairman) that the Provisional IRA are only fighting the Army is palpably absurd; the Provisionals’ aim is to achieve unification by brute force and to this end their campaign has been sectarian and directed mainly against civilian targets. 
3. When, in spite of our best endeavours, we fail to prevent intimidation, 
our inability to be everywhere at once should not be seen as anything new. All through 1971 and 1972 our most determined efforts to thwart the IRA’s bombing campaign were unable to prevent numerous explosions throughout the Province. The hit and run attack aimed at soft targets can be only fully countered at source. Hence the vital importance of members of the public giving information, which can be done confidentially and anonymously over the robot phone. 
4. Organisations such as the UDA and CESA, which are legal but whose 
activities are sometimes a threat to security, are tolerated in so far as their members keep on the right side of the law, but illegal action is prevented so. far as we are able. There is no Army "collaboration" with such organisations. If by talking to their representatives we are able to prevent misunderstanding or accident, such talking is clearly in the public interest. 
5. Suggestions that the Army is "anti-Catholic" or "anti-Protestant" are 
palpably absurd. The very fact that we have been accused of partiality by extremists on both sides confirms our position.

ANNEX E TO 240 G DATED 13 FEB 73 
POLITICO/MILITARY SUMMARY OF 1972 1. The only safe assessment of 1972 is to see it as a build-up period to the 
climax expected in 1973. In political terms this is undoubtedly the case; but in military terms it seems at least possible that historians will identify the climax in 1972, and regard subsequent events as part of a period of consolidation. 
2. 1972 started on an uncertain note. The Provisional. and Official wings of 
the IRA had been seriously weakened by the internment operation, but Catholic opposition to the Government remained strong. In an effort to harness this sentiment to subversion the IRA through such front organisations as NICRA organised illegal marches. This policy bore fruit on 30 January 1972 when an exchange of fire in Londonderry between security forces and gunmen escalated into a relatively large-scale action with 13 fatal civilian casualties. From that day onwards a change in Government policy seemed inevitable, not because extant policy was necessarily wrong, but because it bore the mark of being wrong. 
3. On 24 March 1972 HMG introduced Direct Rule and Secretary of State Whitelaw 
sought to achieve reconciliation with Ulster Catholics without unduly alienating Ulster Protestants. He came close to success when in May the Officials called off violence and in June the Provisionals declared a ceasefire. Unfortunately the Provisionals had interpreted HMG’s concessions as a sign of weakness and had agreed to a ceasefire only because they saw this as a preliminary to Government surrender to all their demands. When this proved to be a false assumption they reverted to violence. 
4. Although these efforts failed to achieve peace they did at least deprive the 
IRA of its heroic image in the eyes of Irish Catholic opinion, not to mention world opinion. By mid-July the Provisionals, though stronger in numerical and material terms than ever before, had lost the battle for sympathy and respect which is an essential preliminary to military success. Their bombing campaign was largely discredited and only the existence of the Londonderry ’No-Go’ areas kept alive their dream of a "final take-over of the North". The real importance to a guerrilla force of "liberated areas" is the evidence which such areas appear to provide of a gradual and remorseless seizure of power providing in its wake safe havens within which revolutionary leaders can posture before the world’s TV cameras. The apparent unwillingness of the Government to deal with ’No-Go’ areas gave hope to subversives that the Government could be blackmailed by fear of civilian casualties into surrender. In so far as this unwillingness was for a time real, the value to the IRA of Bloody Sunday may be seen as crucial. 
5. Operation MOTORMAN put an end to all this. The subsequent struggle to 
neutralise the IRA has been and remains hard. But whilst we have yet finally to defeat the IRA, any real prospect that they might beat us vanished when the Saracen APCs drove virtually unopposed into the Bogside and Creggan in the early light of 31 July. 
6. The triumph of the first 4 months of Direct Rule was the discrediting of the 
IRA. The tragedy was a strengthening of the belief in all communities in the effectiveness of violence as a means of influencing political events. It is this belief that gives rise to apprehension over Protestant reaction to HMG’s White Paper in early 1973. If the worst fears are realised then the coming year may indeed build up to both military and political climax; if, however, it is possible to contain extreme Protestant militancy within a minority section of that community, then the level of violence may have less than Doomsday proportions and the climax may be political only.

14 February, 1973 In your letter of 12 February you asked for a 
note on the talks which have been taking place at official level ith the Irish on the proposal for a Council of Ireland. I enclose a note, which has been drafted after discussion with the Northern Ireland Office. I enclose also, as requested, a copy of the Irish Constitution. 
On 13 February Dr. O’Sullivan, acting under 
instructions, proposed a further round of official talks sometime in February. Sir Stewart Crawford sail that we would consider the request, but that he doubted the value of any further meeting in advance of the Election. Dr. O’Sullivan expressed no surprise at this and showed that he personally considered that any further contacts could best be made after the Election in connection with a meeting between the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach. We can consider what reply to make to the Irish request after the meeting at Chequers next week. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Platt (NIO) 
and Howard Smith (Cabinet Office), without the second enclosure.

Council of Ireland: Preliminary Discussions with The Irish Government 
When the Prime Minister met Mr. Lynch on 24 November 
the latter suggested that officials on the two sides should begin discussions on the possibility of creating a Council of Ireland. Following this, two meetings took place, under the chairmanship of Sir Stewart Crawford, on 1 and 22 January. They were attended by the Irish Ambassador and a representative of the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and, on the second occasion, of the Irish Department of Finance; on our side, representatives of FCO and NIO were present. 2. 
We explained on both occasions that the meetings must 
be regarded as ad referendum since we had not yet had an opportunity of seeking the views of Ministers on this subject. The Irish for their part accepted this. 3. 
The Irish made it clear that they were looking for a 
full-scale Council, in some ways similar to EEC institutions, with a Council of Ministers, a small secretariat and a parliamentary assembly representing the Parliament in Dublin and the elected Assembly in Belfast. They regarded our readiness to establish a Council with real functions as a test of our willingness to turn the promise of an Irish Dimension into reality. We for our part explained that it wasnot possible to see clearly the structure or functions of a Council until the overall settlement in Northern Ireland was finally decided upon; functions devolved by HMG on any new Northern Ireland Assembly
