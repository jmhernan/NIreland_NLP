HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 30 AUGUST 1972 
Introduction 
1. IRA Activity. Shooting incidents at Security Forces have increased marginally over the previous week. However a major shooting incident lasting 3 hrs took place in Beechmount area in which 2000 rounds were exchanged. 
There were 33 explosions during the week, many of which were 
in rural areas and once again a premature explosion killed two or possibly three bombers. SF casualties continue to be heavy, 7 killed and 26 wounded including 2 UDR soldiers killed in an explosion and 2 soldiers being killed by sniper fire. The Provisional IRA has extended its campaign of intimidation, not only to deter the civilian population from assisting the SF but to force them to assist the IRA through fear rather than through political conviction. Recent statements by the Provisional IRA have emphasised their determination to press attacks against military targets. 
2. Protestant Activity. The Royal Black Preceptory marches of 26 August passed without incident. For the last 3 years these marches had not taken place because of the blanket ban on parades. UDA activity has been less noticeable as have the activities of the Protestant extremists although information linking them with recent acts of violence continues to be confirmed. There is also evidence that general crime is taking place under the cloak of the UDA but without the permission or approval of the Inner Council. The RUC have arrested 6 Protestants, 2 armed, in two separate incidents. Neither incident had sectarian or political overtones but those serve as examples of a section of the Protestant community which is taking advantage of the existing state of lawlessness. 
3. A number of antique UVF weapons were discovered buried in a freshly dug hole at the North of the Crumlin Road. 
4. Security Forces Activity. There has been no change to the recent policy of maintai 
patrols in all areas with the intention of restricting the 
movement of bombers and gunmen. Arrests of wanted men have continued, among them Thomas Gorman and Desmond Mackin, who has since been charged with the attempted murder of Lt Watt, 2 Fd Regt RA. Gorman is also believed to be responsible for the increasingly sophisticated explosive devices which have been found in the Andersonstown area. A number of weapons have been found including two Armalite AR 180 rifles, bringing the total of armalite rifles found during Op MOTORMAN to at least eleven and the number of SLRs recovered to 3. 
4. Op GRENADA patrols continue despite the disruption caused to the minesweeper refitting programme by the industrial problems in the naval dockyards. The two most recent patrols were carried out by fishery protection vessels. Since 1 January 1972 over 430 ships have been boarded by minesweepers of the Royal Navy and the LRRSC of the Royal Air Force. Although no arms have been found the continuous presence of the patrol is well known to all ships who sail in Northern Ireland waters and acts as a constant and effective threat to seaborne gun-running. 
5. As a result of the interrogation of 15 people between 25 and 28 August 1972 one successful arrest operation was mounted and 3 IRA Provisionals out of a planned total of 7 were arrested.

NIOM(72)34 Note of a meeting at noon on 25 August 
OPERATIONS There are signs that the Provisionals are switching from indiscriminate 
bombing and shooting attacks towards a policy of more carefully-laid ambushes and more accurate sniping attacks on the security forces. Since Operation Motorman fourteen members of the security forces have been killed and fifty-six wounded. ARREST AND INTERROGATION POLICIES 2. 
The meeting discussed the current arrest and interrogation policies against 
the background of a serious level of military casualties, which had already given rise to press enquiries. Possible changes in the law or legal procedure are being considered by an inter-departmental group. In considering in due course whether the present arrest and interrogation policies are achieving their. objectives it will be helpful to have an analysis of the people arrested since Operation Motorman and what has happened to them. It will then be possible to form a view as to the reasons why the hard-core of the Provisionals appears not yet to have been brought into custody. The Ministry of Defence will try to prepare this analysis and make it available to the GOC, with whom there will probably be discussions in Northern Ireland next week. INFORMATION POLICY 3. 
Questions about the Government’s plans for dealing with the level of 
military casualties are building up, partly because there is little else in the news, and are difficult to handle. There would be great dangers, however, in trying to use the casualties to illustrate that the Provisionals had been forced to reduce their campaign against civilians. LEGAL MATTERS 4. 
It has been confirmed that there is no objection to charges being brought 
of membership of the IRA, being an unlawful association under the Special Powers Act. When there is evidence, arrests can therefore be made with a view to charges being brought. The Ministry of Defence and Northern Ireland Office will ensure that this is understood by the Army and the RUC respectively. NEXT MEETING 5. 
There will be no meeting on Tuesday, 29 August. The meeting at noon on Friday, 1 September, will be in Conference Room ’B’.

Reference: A. A/BR/30/1/M04 dated 23 August 1972. 1. 
Headquarters Northern Ireland weekly operational summary for the 
week ending 23 August 1972 was circulated under Reference A. An updating of the summary up to 0800hrs Friday 25 August is attached at Annex A. 
2. 3. The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. The weekly intelligence report as at 25 August 1972 has been 
issued separately. OUTLOOK 4. 
The Provisional IRA can be expected to try to escalate the bombing 
and the attacks on the security forces ( using snipers and booby traps), while at the same time being extremely careful not to involve innocent civilians. However, they will continue by their activities to remain isolated from the people and may be forced to rely increasingly on intimidation to impose their will on the minority. 
5. 
The UDA will outwardly retain a responsible position and will not pose a significant security threat this week.

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 23 AUGUST 1972 
INTRODUCTION IRA Violence 1. 
The marked decrease in shooting incidents involving the Security 
Forces and the increase in Security Force casualties suggests a greater selectivity in choice of targets. However the number of explosions has increased, although a number of the targets have been in suburban areas. Attacks on the electricity supply system continue in the country. A large premature explosion in Newry killed 8 people including two terrorists and injured six bringing the total of civilian casualties during the week to 11 killed and 78 wounded. IRA casualties claimed during the period are nine. 
Protestant Violence 2. 
Although there have been widespread reports of UDA road blocks and 
of motorists being beaten up by UDA men in remote parts of the Province only three such road blocks were seen and dealt with by Security Forces. Three bombs planted in Catholic areas are believed to be the work of Protestant extremists. 
Security Forces Activities. 3. 
The Security Forces have continued to maintain patrols 
with the intention of restricting the movement of bombers and gunmen in all areas. This activity has tended to be concentrated in urban areas with the result that the terrorists have chosen soft targets in the suburbs. However the number of shooting incidents has decreased and finds and arrests continue to be made. It is to be noted that no IRA terrorists and only a single weapon have been recovered as a result of information received in questioning at the Police Offices. 
RUC Patrols in Catholic Areas 4. 
Joint RUC/RMP patrols have now been taking place in Catholic areas 
for two weeks. Despite the willingness of the individual constables to carry out these patrols it has become evident that the majority of Catholics in these areas are not prepared to tolerate an RUC presence. The RUC are well aware of this feeling and consider that it will be a long time before they are accepted. 
Political 5. 
The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland holds its conference of all Loyalist political groups today , 23 Aug 72. The Vanguard Movement threat to 
become a political party may materialise if the conference does not succeed in achieving a measure of unity amongst the Loyalist Organisations. It is interesting that unity was the theme taken by all the speakers at the poorly supported UDA/LAW rally in Belfast on 19 August.

2. 3. The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. The weekly intelligence report as at 18 August 1972 has been 
issued separately. OUTLOOK 4. 
It must be expected that the Provisional IRA will attempt to step up 
the campaign of violence, in order to regain the initiative from the Security Forces, and to seek to demonstrate that Op MOTORMAN and subsequent arms recoveries and arrests have not sapped thier ability to operate. Sniping in the cities will continue, and explosive attacks of a spectacular and headline grabbing nature may possibly occur with, in each case, Security Forces as prime targets. A confirmed report has indicated that a second "Bloody Friday" operation may be mounted in the near future. Activity in the border areas is likely to increase, particularly, according to a reliable report, cross-border shootings, and the planting of mines which can be detonated from the Republic. If past experience is a guide, a demonstration of the Provisionals’ ability to mount a major operation can be expected shortly before the Secretary of State’s conference convenes in England in September.

UPDATING POINTS FOR HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY AS AT FRIDAY 18 AUGUST 1972 
INTRODUCTION 
1. General. The military posture remains unchanged and selective searches continued to produce small finds and arrests of wanted men including two officer of 3 Bn Provisional IRA. The significant events of the last 48 hours have been the continued reduction of shooting incidents at SF in Belfast to a level of around 6 per day. Elsewhere in the Province there were only 3 shooting at SF throughout the entire period. However the SF have suffered relatively severe casualties totalling 1 killed and 5 wounded. The renewed spate of large bombings resulted in a predictably vocal reaction from the UDA. The manifestations of this reaction were not as noticeable as the news media have suggested and no UDA patrols were seen by SF patrols. All Official IRA men have now been released from internment and they are making a concerted effort to obtain the support of the general public within their areas of influence. 
BELFAST 
2. The Security Forces sustained 1 fatal casualty and 4 other casualties in 2 bombings and 1 shooting incident. 
3. There were no shooting incidents at the Security Forces in Andersonstown but widespread juvenile hooliganism continued and troops being stoned were forced to fire baton rounds on a number of occasions. A blast bomber lost his hand in a premature explosion. 
4. A remotely detonated bomb in a shop severely injured two soldiers of a passing foot patrol in Cupar St. 
5. The major incident of the period was the explosion which demolished the Standard Bar in Agnes Street. This caused two SF casualties and a civilian casualty, and, despite a warning, some 50 people were treated in hospital for shock. This large figure resulted from the reluctance of onlookers to leave the areas as ordered by the SF. A second bomb demolished the forecourt of a new filling station on the Antrim Road. These two incidents resulted in a declaration by the UDA that they would mobilise 3,000 men to assist the Security Forces in the prevention of bombings and assassinations. The news media seized on this development and newspaper reports of UDA patrols out in force on the streets were not borne out by fact.

SACEUR’s EVALUATION OF EFFECT OF DEPLOYMENT OF UK UNITS FROM BAOR TO NORTHERN IRELAND References: 
A. SACEUR SH 66081/14.8 SHAPTO 5168 B. TLM/241515Z Aug/REPSEC 410 1. 
UKMILREP BRUSSELS We consider SACEUR’s assessment of the effect of deployment of 
UK units from BAOR to Northern Ireland to be fair and you may take note of his evaluation of the situation. You should however make the following points referring to paragraphs in Reference A: a. 2A(5). This sub para appears to be outside the terms of reference given to SACEUR as quoted in his Signal (Paragraph 1). Deployment of units of SSR to Northern Ireland 
is not reported to NATO as they are merely redeployments within the UK. 
The NATO status of these units as earmarked 
forces remains unchanged as would their deployment times if they were called for by SACEUR. In any case it should be noted that UK Royal Marines do not form part of SACEUR’s strategic reserve. They are earmarked for assignment to SACLANT. b. Para 2B(2) and 2B(4). 
BAOR units now in Northern Ireland 
could all be returned to Germany within 77 hours. Furthermore it is our view that, in the likely event of a crisis being preceeded by a period of political tension, it would be feasible to phase (a) the return of units to BAOR, (b) the redeployment of the strategic reserve and (c) the reinforcement of BAOR with reservists, so that our planned deployment timings uld not be exceeded.

TEMPORARY RE-DEPLOYMENT OF BAOR UNITS TO NORTHERN IRELAND 1. 
Now that the dust has settled, I wonder if we could 
look again at the working of the procedures laid down in SOP 36 of 6 December 1971 for informing NATO about the re-deployment of units from BAOR to Northern Ireland. As far as the military side is concerned, things seem to have gone well. 
The Military Committee was informed by 
UK MILREP, and both General Steinhoff and SACEUR received personal messages from the CDS, in advance of th redeployment. 
2. On the political side the procedure also seems to 
have gone reasonably well: but there were some loom ends. When major units are being transferred temporarily from BAOR we need to inform Sir Edward Peck and ask him to pass on the information to the Secretary-General and, when appropriate, to other members of the Council at the right moment and in whatever way he thinks best. 
You spoke to 
UKDEL NATO on the telephone, and Sir Edward Peck was therefore in the picture and able to take appropriate action. But the procedure laid down envisages (for good and sufficient reason) that FCO(WOD) will be consulted about the drafting of the signal to UKNMR and SACEUR (Annex B to SOP 36, paragraph 4), and indeed 
important - that it will be the FCO that informs UKDEL of the action contemplated (SOP 36, paragraph 4b). this did not happen.

WITHDRAWAL OF UNITS FROM BAOR You will have seen UKDEL telegram no 334 of 3 August. 
2. 
The procedure under which this issue is being raised in DPC today is a NATO resolution of 1955 (C-M(55)82(Final)) whereby: 
a. "If a Government feels compelled to withdraw units from the area of NATO command to which they are assigned or earmarked in order to meet an emergency elsewhere, it shall at once inform the appropriate NATO military authorities, and the Council, at the first possible opportunity." 
b. [We have complied with this - handsomely.] 
"The NATO military authorities shall, at the earliest possible stage, provide for the Council an estimate of the military effects of the proposed alteration, notified by member Governments 
3. We first heard rumours of the possibility of this being raised 
in DFC late on 2 August, and at once suggested to UKDEL that the Ambassador should nobble the Secretary General and suggest forcefully to him that it would be in no-one’s real interests for this NATO procedure to be implemented on the present occasion. At that stage UKDEL were in a fairly relaxed mood. They saw this as a routine, and almost certainly unavoidable, process which need not excite us particularly. However it was agreed that the Ambassador should make the approach to the Deputy Secretary General (in Luns’ absence) which we had suggested and this has been done. It has not succeeded in securing the removal of the item from the DPC agenda but one hopes that Mr Pansa has been sufficiently impressed to conduct the item in a minor key. 
4. As regards our tactics in DPC today we and the Delegation are 
at one. We must not make such a fuss as to suggest that we are afraid of a military assessment being carried out, or to provoke resentment on the part of the Canadians, the Danes, the Belgians and the US

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 250700 TO 290700 AUGUST 72 1. GENERAL. 
Military casualties continued at a high level. On Fri/Sat, two 
members of 4 UDR (ENNIKILLEN) were killed when they wont to investigate a car which exploded. On Sun/Mon, Pte ROWE (1LI) was shot dead in the Bone area of Belfast by an OP who mistook him for a gunman whilst he was on patrol. Sgt METCALFE (1 COLDM GDS) was shot dead by a sniper firing from open ground at the new Creggan Camp, Londonderry. On Mon/Tue, Cpl MORRILL(3 RGJ) was shot dead by a sniper while on foot patrol in the Beechmount area of Belfast. These holiday weekend deaths bring the total SF killed since Op MOTORMAN on 31 Jul to 19 in all, one of whom was accidentally killed. Of the remaining 18, 15 were Army and 3 UDR. Of the latter one was murdered near Newtownbutler and the other two were killed by a booby trap car near Enniskillen. Of the 15 Army killed, 7 were in Belfast, 6 on the border and 2 in Derry; 8 were killed by snipers, 3 by border mines, 2 by booby trps, 1 by stoning and 1 was an ATO dismantling a bomb. Details of operational events covering the holiday weekend are summarised in paras 2-5 below. The major incident occured late on Monday night when there was a gunbattle around the RVH Broadway location in Belfast. A full report of this incident is not yet available and some of the fugures may change when all the troops involved have been fully debrifed. Gunmen fired over 1000 rds and 3 RGJ returned 800. At least 8 hits are claimed of which 2 were definite. At one point during the battle shots were seen to be fired from a nearby Protestant area at the IRA gunmen. The major trend is undoubtedly towards a direct confrontation between the IRA and the Army. 
2. During Fri/Sat 25/26 AUG there were 27 shooting incidents 15 of which involved SF. There were 10 explosions and ATO neutralised 3 bombs. There were 2 military casualties as a result of shootings and near Enniskillen 2 UDR soldiers were killed by an explosion as they investigated an abandoned oar. In the same incident 11 soldiers were injured when their 4xton vehicle was overturned by the blast. An NCO is VSI after an accidental discharge in the back of a Saracen. 1 man (RC) was found dead (GSW to the head) and 6 other civilians were wounded. A funeral attended by 150 members of the UDA and followed by a crowd of 4-5000 passed off without incident in Belfast. 
3. During Sat/Sun 26/27 AUG SF were involved in 17 of 30 shooting incidents. 1 hit was claimed. 4 bombs were planted, 2 exploded. In 1, 3 bodies, belonging probably to the bombers, were found at Downpatrick Race Course. The Royal Black Preceptory Meetings, which were hold in several towns throughout the Province, passed without incident. Pte Smith 2 PARA and Gnr Jones recieved minor GSW. 
4. During Sun/Mon 27/28 AUG there were 25 shooting incidents, 18 involving the SF. A Sgt of 1 COLDM GDS was shot dead in Londonderry following a large demonstration outside the Creggan Camp. A Pte of 1 LI was shot dead in the Bone area of Belfast when a military OP mistook him for a gunman. A soldier was wounded in the Falls. 1 gunman was hit and is in RVH with gunshot wounds, and another hit was claimed. There were 3 explosions but no casualties. There were 2 useful finds in the Rural areas.

Note of a meeting at noon on 25 August 
OPERATIONS There are signs that the Provisionals are switching from indiscriminate 
bombing and shooting attacks towards a policy of more carefully-laid ambushes and more accurate sniping attacks on the security forces. Since Operation Motorman fourteen members of the security forces have been killed and fifty-six wounded. 
ARREST AND INTERROGATION POLICIES 2. 
The meeting discussed the current arrest and interrogation policies against 
the background of a serious level of military casualties, which had already given rise to press enquiries. Possible changes in the law or legal procedure are being considered by an inter-departmental group. In considering in due course whether the present arrest and interrogation policies are achieving theirobjectives it will be helpful to have an analysis of the people arrested since Operation Motorman and what has happened to them. It will then be possible to form a view as to the reasons why the hard-core of the Provisionals appears not yet to have been brought into custody. The Ministry of Defence will try to prepare this analysis and make it available to the GOC, with whom there will probably be discussions in Northern Ireland next week. INFORMATION POLICY 3. 
Questions about the Government’s plans for dealing with the level of 
military casualties are building up, partly because there is little else in the news, and are difficult to handle. There would be great dangers, however, in trying to use the casualties to illustrate that the Provisionals had been forced to reduce their campaign against civilians. LEGAL MATTERS 4. 
It has been confirmed that there is no objection to charges being brought 
of membership of the IRA, being an unlawful association under the Special Powers Act. When there is evidence, arrests can therefore be made with a view to charges being brought. The Ministry of Defence and Northern Ireland Office will ensure that this is understood by the Army and the RUC respectively. NEXT MEETING 5. 
There will be no meeting on Tuesday, 29 August. The meeting at noon on Friday, 1 September, will be in Conference Room ’B’.

The Committee of Public Accounts reported on 23 August that more than £76,000 of a £100,000 grant in aid voted by the Government of the Republic for the relief of distress in the North in 1969-70 had not been accounted for. Less than £30,000 was spent on the relief of distress, while almost £35,000 was spent, possibly in Belfast, on undetermined purposes and almost £41,500 was definitely not spent on the relief of distress. The Committee noted that a former Irish Army intelligence officer had admitted that £32,000 had been spent on the purchase of arms in Germany, and recommended that when attempts to recover the money had been completed, the Minister of Finance should make a statement to the Dail. 
The Committee was ordered to investigate the spending of the £100,000 grant-in-aid after the arms trial in 1970 when a number of people in Irish public life, including former Ministers, were acquitted of conspiring to import arms (see HONIP(70)40 et seq). 
CCNFERENCE CALLED BY THE GRAND ORANGE LODGE OF IRELAND 
3. A policy meeting of Loyalist leaders was called by the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland on Wednesday. Only representatives of the Ulster 
Vanguard and the Unionist Party were present. The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and the Loyalist Association of Workers stayed away because the UDA had not been invited. A statement issued after the conference said that unanimous agreement had been reached that the British heritage could best be preserved by the restoration of a meaningful parliament at Stormont and with adequate facilities for peace and good government. The statement added that a further meeting might be held on that basis and an early General Election would be welcome. 
ARMY OCCUPATION OF SCHOOLS

21 August 1972 ESCAPE TUNNEL AT LONG KESH 
You wrote to me on 15 August saying that the Prime Minister wondered how it was possible for the would be escapers to tunnel so far without being discovered; and that he considered that more effective precautions against possible escape should be put in hand at once. 
Enclosed is a report from the Ministry of Home Affairs in Northern Ireland which fully covers both points. It shows that the prospects of anyone being able to escape through the tunnel were in fact very slim indeed. None the less further precautions, which we hope the Prime Minister will agree are adequate, have been taken.

ATTEMPTED TUNNEL ESCAPE FROM LONG KESH INTERNMENT CENTRE 
On Sunday evening 13 August 1972 a Prison Officer on duty at Long Kesh noticed some subsidence of the ground just outside the perimeter of Compound 5 but inside the perimeter of the Centre itself. 
Investigation by Prison Officers and the Army led to the discovery of a tunnel some 60 feet long starting in Compound 5 under the floor of Nissen Hut 26 which is used partly as sleeping accommodation and partly for hobbies, recreation, etc. The tunnel had caved in some 20 feet from the perimeter fence of the Centre. 
A head count of the compound showed that the numbers of internees were correct and a thorough search was made of the compound and the internees housed therein. This showed that a considerable quantity of soil had been stored in the internees clothes lockers in Hut 26 and indeed in lockers in some of the other huts in Compound 5. 
Long Kesh Internment Centre is sited within the perimeter of an Army camp and security is a joint responsibility of the Prison Service and the Army. 
Security within the Centre.is provided by prison officers who guard the perimeter of each compound and the entrance to the whole Centre. Prison officers in pairs patrol within each compound but do not normally enter the huts. Occasional searches are made of the huts but only when it is suspected that something untoward is going on. Any search is made in some strength and with Army support. 
The circumstances in which men are held at Long Kesh mean that some attempts at escape are inevitable. The men are held in compounds of about 60 men each (at the peak period there have been 86 men in each compound) and are able freely to mix within the compound. Each compound comprises four nissen huts of which one is for messing, two for sleeping accommodation and one is half sleeping accommodation and half for recreation. There are other buildings for ablutions and study. At night the men are locked in their sleeping quarters but it would not be impossible by any means for them to break out of their particular hutments.

Note of a meeting at noon on 15 August 
DIRECTIVE ON INTERROGATION The N.I.O. representatives reported that the latest versions of the 
document on arrest policy and of the directive on interrogation procedure had been sent to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. They would be issued, subject to his approval. OPERATIONS 2. 
The situation had remained relatively quiet since Operation Motorman. 
The most significant point of note was the campaign to remove the Army from schools in the former no-go areas. The R.E’s were at work on providing new accommodation for the Army. INTELLIGENCE 3. 
The IRA appeared to be directing their campaign against border areas 
and the Security Forces. This was in line with their attempts to win back the support of the Catholic population. Newspaper reports of IRA connection with other terrorist organisations, though having a certain amount of truth, were probably much exaggerated. 4. 
The Reverend Ian Paisley and Desmond Boal seemed to be stepping back 
into the limelight, and trying to unify the Protestant community. The announcement of the conference date would probably accelerate this 5.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION 
GENERAL 1. 
REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 110700 TO 140700 AUGUST 72 The level of shooting and particularly bombing incidents was low 
throughout the Province. This was particularly noticeable in the rural and border areAs where there had recently been signs of an increase in violence. The apprentice Boys Celebrations passed off without incident, some 3000 attending the official ceremonies in the City Centre, which had been authorised, and about 1800 joining Ian Paisley for his march on the Waterside, which also fell within limits agreed by the Security Forces. This is the most decisive act of leadership Ian Paisley has made for some months and is presumably designed to restore his image before the all party talks. Meanwhile the UDA and the now politically minded LAW have objected at their exclusion from the talks, saying that the present Stormont composition is not representative. The arrest of Terence Clarke in the Ardeyne was a good success since he is a murderer, an escapee from Crumlin jail, and is thought to have been involved in a number of bombings and robberies. However his importance in the IRA hierarchy has perhaps been overplayed in the media. 2. During Fri/Sat 11/12 Aug 72. SF were involved in 15 of the 18 shooting incidents. Lcpl Shane and Mne Scully received GSW to the thighs, and 1 hit was claimed in the Ardoyne. Two bombers blew themselves up in a car in North Howard Street, Ballymurphy. In Londonderry one 20 lb bomb exploded in Shantallow, the other in Strand Road did not explode. A UDR patrol was fired on from across the border near AUGHNACLOY. Small finds were made throughout the Province. 
3. During Sat/Sun 12/13 Aug 72. SF were involved in 8 of the 14 shooting incidents, 1 hit was claimed. Thomas Foster an off duty UDR man was found with GSW to the thigh in Ballymurphy. At 1100hrs 3000 people took part in thewreath laying and cathedral services to commemorate the action of 13 Apprenticies in Derry in 1688, in the afternoon 1800 led by Rev Paisley marched around the Waterside and held a meeting outside the railway station, as planned. There was only one minor incident. 
4. During Sun/Mon 13/14 Aug 72. SF were involved in 12 of the 14 
shootings, 1 hit was claimed. In Andersonstown four soldiers of 1 RGJ were injured when a command detonated 1-5 lb screw bomb exploded. In the New Lodge area one marine was slightly injured, 
were taken for questioning. A crowd of 200 in the Unity flats area bad to be dispersed. Finds continue to be made.

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND At the same time as your office was considering 
possible new constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland, I would like them to examine what sort of formal machinery should be set up for the improvement of relations and an increase in co-operation between the United Kingdom and the Republic. Although many spheres of activity will be covered 
by the Community institutions when we are both members of the E.E.C. there may still be scope for special consultation between us on matters affecting both Northern and Southern Ireland. As it is likely that the Westminster Government 
will remain sovereign in all major matters, the AngloIrish arrangements will have to be between the Iwo sovereign Governments. 
But at the same time we ought 
to find ways of including as many Northern Ireland interests in them as possible. I should like this matter to be handled with some 
degree of urgency. It may be necessary for me to have a meeting with Mr. Lynch before long and, if I could have in mind what sort of proposals we would be likely to make in this sphere, it would be a great help.

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND I have a naging feeling that the Regular I.R.A., 
who have maintained their truce despite the provocations of the Provisionals but who have also been reinforced by the release of all their members from internment, may possibly be preparing to intervene again, fully organised, at a later stage should the opportunity offer itself. How good is our intelligence about the members 
of the Regulars, what they are up to, and what their intentions are? And have we got any particular plans to cope with 
such an eventuality?

TO PRIME MINISTER FROM DUTY CLERK YOU MAY BE INTERESTED TO SEE A COPY OF A TELEGRAM FROM 
WASHINGTON WHICH HAS JUST ARRIVED ABOUT NORTHERN IRELAND: ON 9 AUGUST SENATOR KENNEDY MADE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT 
IN THE US SENATE. 
QUOTE MR PRESIDENT TODAY THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND, CAUGHT AMID THE NEW BLOODSHED AND DESTRUCTION THAT HAVE SHOCKED THE WORLD IN RECENT WEEKS, MARK THE UNHAPPY FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF GREAT BRITAIN’S CRUEL AND REPRESSIVE POLICY OF INTERNMENT. 
PERHAPS THERE IS NO STEP THAT CAN BE TAKEN NOW IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT IS CAPABLE OF STEMMING THE FEROCIOUS TIDE OF 
VIOLENCE THREATENING TO CONSUME THE PEOPLE OF ULSTER, PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC ALIKE. 
BUT I BELIEVE THAT AN END OF 
THE UNCONSCIONABLE POLICY OF INTERNMENT MUST RANK AT THE TOP OF THE LIST OF AVAILABLE STEPS THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE TAKEN IF THERE IS TO BE ANY HOPE AT ALL OF BRINGING AN EARLY AND PEACEFUL END TO THE KILLING AND VIOLENCE. 
NO NATION THAT 
CALLS ITSELF A DEMOCRACY CAN JUSTIFY A POLICY OF INTERNMENT FOR ITS CITIZENS. 
IN THE CASE OF NORTHERN IRELAND, THE SHAME OF INTERNMENT HAS BEEN TWICE COMPOUNDED - FIRST BY THE 
EVIDENCE OF TORTURE IN THE INTERNMENT CAMPS, THE FACTS OF WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED BEYOND DISPUTE IN THE RECENT COMPTON REPORT: AND SECOND, BY THE INCREDIBLY UNFAIR MANNER IN WHICH INTERNMENT HAS BEEN APPLIED 
- QUOTE FOR CATHOLICS ONLY UNQUOTE HAS BEEN 
BRITAIN’S INTERNMENT POLICY, AND IT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY APPLIED IN PRACTICE. 
WHAT ABOUT THE UDA? WHAT ABOUT THE PROTESTANT GUNMEN? WHAT ABOUT THE PROTESTANT ASSASSINATION SQUADS WHO HAVE BEEN SO ACTIVE IN RECENT WEEKS? I HOLD NO BRIEF FOR THE IRA, OR FOR THE VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION SO WANTONLY INFLICTED BY MEMBERS OF THE CATHOLIC MINORITY IN ULSTER. BUT SURELY, BRITISH JUSTICE IS 
A FARCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND TODAY, WHEN ONLY CATHOLICS ARE INTERNED AND PROTESTANT GUNMEN ROAM FREE. 
TODAY, WHEN PASSIONS IN ALL THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IN ULSTER ARE RISING HIGH AGAINST GREAT BRITAIN, BECAUSE OF THE BRITISH INVASION OF THE QUOTE NO-GO UNQUOTE AREAS AND THE BRITISH OCCUPATION OF CATHOLIC DISTRICTS, AND WHEN THE OBVIOUS ABSENCE OF COMPARABLE STEPS AGAINST PROTESTANT VIOLENCE IS MAKING A MOCKERY OF BRITAIN’S CLAIM TO EVENHANDEDJUSTICE, IT IS LONG PAST TIME TO CONFRONT THE ISSUE OF INTERNMENT. 
ND SO ON THIS TRAGIC FIRST ANNIVERSARY, I RENEW THE APPEAL HAVE MADE SO OFTEN IN THE PAST, I URGE PRIME MINISTER HEATH 
ND SECRETARY WHITELAW TO ACT NOW TO END INTERNMENT, AND TO RESTORE THE REPUTATION OF JUSTICE AND DECENCY AND FAIRNESS FOR WHICH BRITAIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN RENOWNED.

2. AT THE LONDUNDERRY TALKS WITH ME ON 3 AUGUST (MY 
TEL 025 TO NIO), A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WERE DISCUSSED, BUT THE MAIN TOPIC WAS TALKS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. I AGAIN AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD SEIZE THE POLITICAL OPENINGS PROVIDED BY OPERATION MOTORMAN AND THAT AS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, THEY SHOULD TALK DIRECT WITH MR WHITELAW INSTEAD OF CONTINUING TO USE HIS OFFICIALS SUCH AS MYSELF AS INTERMEDIARIES. 
THE SDLP SAID THAT THOUGHT THEY WANTED TO 
MEET HIM, THEY WOULD NOT DO SO UNLESS THEY FIRST HAD A FIRM GUARANTEE THAT INTERNMENT WOULD BE ENDED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MEETING. 
THEY ARGUED THAT QUITE APART FROM THE INTRINSIC 
MERITS OF THE ENDING OF INTERNMENT, THEY WOULD BE DESTROYED AS A POLITICAL PARTY IF THEY LEFT TALKS WITH MR WHITELAW WITHOUT IT. 
I SAID I WAS SURE HE COULD NOT GIVE ANY SUCH GUARANTEE. I LATER TELEPHONED HIM TO CONFIRM THIS. 
3. THE SDLP THEN ASKED FOR A FURTHER MEETING WITH ME ( ON MONDAY 7 AUGUST). 
THIS WAS A VERY DIFFICULT MEETING. THE 
SDLP ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE POLITICAL FINISH FOR THEM AND A VICTORY FOR THOSE WHO ADVOCATED VIOLENCE AS A MEANS OF GETTING RESULTS, IF THEY LEFT A MEETING WITH MR WHITELAW WITHOUT SOMETHING REALLY BIG TO SHOW FOR THEIR EFFORTS. 
I TRIED TO 
PERSUADE THEM THAT IT WOULD NOT, AND SAID THAT THOUGHT THE SECRTARY OF STATE HAD AUTHORISED ME TO SAY THAT HE WANTED TO HELP THEM IN THEIR DIFFICULT POSITION, HE COULD NOT GIVE THEM GUARANTEES. 
LATER THE SDLP AGREED TO MEET MR WHITELAW. 
4. THE SDLP HAD MEETINGS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE ON 7 AND 8 AUGUST. YOU MAY WISH TO SEND TO FCO AND DUBLIN A COPY OF THE RECORD OF THESE TALKS PREPARED BY MR PLATT (AND DAT A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS WAS DISCUSSED BUT AGAIN THE 
9. AUGUST). MAIN SUBJECT WAS THE ENDING OF INTERNMENT.

NORTHER IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PEIOD 4 AUGUST - 10 AUGUST, 1972. 
Memorandum by the Northern Ireland Office GENERAL 
1. The main political development this week has been the decision of the SDLP to talk to Mr Whitelaw. Discussions at the beginning of the week are due to be followed by further talks today. 
2. On the security front there have been fewer shootings and explosions but a number of demonstrations. Searches by the security forces have yielded substantial finds of arms and explosives, while Martin Meehan, the Provisional IRA leader has been captured in the Ardoyne. 
THE SDLP 
3. Although, following recent military operations, the SDLP had made statements indicating that they were reconsidering their decision to have talks with Mr Whitelaw, they met him on Monday evening, and the talks continued on Tuesday. A Government statement afterwards said ".... 
Among 
the subjects discussed were internment, security policy and the military use of certain facilities in the minority areas. The delegation expressed strong views that internment should now end following the success of the military domination of the former "no go" areas. 
4. The Secretary of State said that he had today shown an earnest of his good intent by releasing 47 internees and he pointed out that he had been following Her Majesty’s Government’s policy by phasing out internment since direct rule by releasing nearly 700 internees. 
5. The Secretary of State took note of the SDLP’s views and undertook to convey them to Mr Heath as soon as possible. A further meeting with the SDLP is to take place in Belfast on Friday. 
6. The SDLP said they did not feel that the release of 47 internees was adequate and have insisted on a complete end to internment. They welcomed the assurances they had been given on the impartiality of arms searches and the Secretary of State’s determination to end private armies, and reiterated the strength of their constituents’ feelings in relation to

The Secretary of State Mr Steele 
Mr Cooper Mr Currie Mr Devlin

Mr Fitt Mr Hume Mr Jacottet Mr O’Hanlon (From 3.05 pm) Mr McGrady 
The Secretary of State said that, since their last meeting, he had spoken to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Defence and put to them the arguments that the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had put to him on the ending of internment. He reiterated the arguments, ie, that both he and the SDLP have the same objectives; that the SDLP want him to succeed; that they have supported him in the past; and that the political bonus of ending internment would be an end of the civil disobedience campaign. The Secretary of State said that the Prime Minister and Lord Carrington had explained to him that they fully understood the SDLP position and that the views of the SDLP would be considered; however, as yet, no decision had been taken on the ending of internment. The Secretary of State said that he knew that this outcome would disapoint the SDLP but he hoped that they would be patient since more time was needed. The Secretary of State added that it is still HMG’s policy to phase out internment as soon as the security situation permits; the only point of issue between HMG and the SDLP

Annex B to Northern Ireland Situation Report 090700 to 100700 AUG 72 
OP GRENADA INCIDENT 1. 
On 9 Aug the National radio and television news programmes reported an 
incident in which a minesweeper of the Royal Navy boarded and searched a German vessel on 8 Aug. The details of the incident, which is only notable for the publicity it received, are as follows° 
a. HMS HUBBERTSON boarded the German ship BELL VIGOUR on 8 Aug 3 miles 
off the Antrim Coast. The German vessel had initially ignored orders to stop within the 3 mile limit. The Master was interviewed on the bridge and then went below with the boarding officer to examine the ships papers. These were found to be in order and indicated that although the ship was registered in BRAKE it was on long term charter to BELL CHARTER DUBLIN, sailing under the German Flag. 
b. The crew of nine and the four passengers, with the exception of 
one sleeping crewman, were mustered on the bridge while the ship was searched. They were cooperative and the atmosphere was friendly. Once the ship had been found to be "clean" it was allowed to proceed. 
c. Although the attitude of the crew was friendly and cooperative the 
Master,HASE, was anti-British and protested in principle against the search although he agreed to it being carried out. 
d. On the television interview in DUBLIN, Her HASE stated that the 
officer had been correct and polite and he made no adverse comments on the say in which the search had been conducted.

TO FLASH DUBLIN TELNO 188 OF 10 AUGUST INFO UKREP BELFAST. 
FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF THE MESSAGE REFERRED TO IN MIPT. BEGINS: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR MESSAGE OF 1 AUGUST. YOUR 
AMBASSADOR WILL HAVE REPORTED THE CONVERSATION WHICH HE AND I HAD THAT EVENING. SUBSEQUENTLY MR. WHITELAW WAS ABLE TO HAVE A VERY HELPFUL DISCUSSION WITH DR. HILLERY, AND HE WILL NO DOUBT HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT. iT IS CERTAINLY OUR WISH AND OUR INTENTION THAT THE MILITARY STEPS 
WE WERE RECENTLY OBLIGED TO TAKE SHOULD QUICKLY BE FOLLOWED BY POLITICAL MEASURES. WE HAVE ALWAYS EMPHASISED THAT THE PROBLEM WILL NOT BE SOLVED BY MILITARY MEANS ALONE. AS YOU WILL KNOW, MR. WHITELAW HAS NOW HELD TWO MEETINGS WITH THE 
SDLP MEMBERS: THE DISCUSSION IS TO BE RESUMED ON FRIDAY. WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL AGREE TO TAKE PART IN THE CONFERENCE WHICH WE PLAN TO HOLD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. MR. WHITELAW EXPECTS TO ANNOUNCE THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THIS CONFERENCE VERY SHORTLY. AS HE EXPLAINED TO DR. HILLERY LAST WEEK, WE THINK THAT THE POLITICAL PARTIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND SHOULD BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF WORKING OUT THEIR OWN SOLUTION OF THE LONG TERM PROBLEM. 
AM CONVINCED THAT IT IS AN IMPORTANT CONDITION OF 
SUCCESS THAT THE NORTHERN IRELAND PARTIES SHOULD HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER’S POINTS OF VIEW, THE PROPOSAL IS THEREFORE TO LIMT THE CONFERENCE TO THE NORTHERN IRELAND PARTIES (WHICH, OF COURSE, INVOLVES THE EXCLUSION OF OUR OWN POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE REST OF THE UNITED KINGDOM). THIS, HOWEVER SHOULD NOT PREVENT US FROM KEEPING IN THE CLOSEST 
TOUCH ON ALL THESE MATTERS. I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT BY ONE MEANS AND ANOTHER WE SHALL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONTACT OVER ALL THESE PROBLEMS AS THE SOLUTIONS DEVELOP, AS IS OUR HOPE, OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. IT IS BETTER, I FEEL SURE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND, THAT THESE CONTACTS SHOULD BE CONFIDENTIAL (THOUGH THEY NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE

Thank you very much for your message of 
1 August. Your Ambassador will have reported the conversation which he and I had that evening. Subsequently Mr. Whitelaw was able to have a very helpful discussion with Dr. Hillery, and he will no doubt have told you about that. It is certainly our wish and our intention 
that the military steps we were recently obliged to take should quickly be followed by political measures. We have always emphasised that the problem will not be solved by military means alone. As you will know, Mr. Whitelaw has now held two meetings with the SDLP members;

Mr. Lynch, in reply to the message which he sent you on 1 August. If you approve, we will ask Sir John Peck to 
deliver the message to Mr. Lynch as soon as possible. We hope that this will be today; thereafter Mr. Whitelaw will write to Mr. Merlyn Rees about the handing in of arms in Northern Ireland, and Mr. Whitelaw can put out a statement. 
The hope 
is to complete this sequence of operations during today, before the resuming of the talks with the S. D. L.P. tomorrow.

I am replying to your letter of 4 August to Terry Platt about the response which the Prime Minister might make to Mr Lynch’s message. I enclose a draft for this purpose which has been agreed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence. The draft takes account of the present stage of the talks which the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is having with the SDLP and assumes that the Prime Minister will write to Mr Lynch before Friday when the next round of talks is likely to take place. You will appreciate that there would be advantage in getting the text to Mr Lynch 
- perhaps by Sir John Peck having a word - before he reads about it in the press. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Johnny Graham and Robert Andrew.

Note of a meeting at noon on 8 August 
CURRENT EVENTS Attacks by gangs on Army observation posts, notably in the Andersonstown 
and Suffolk areas of Belfast, have been a problem. They are probably organised by the Provisionals with the intention of drawing a reaction from the security forces which would alienate the local population. The extent to which the disorders also reflect local feelings generally is uncertain. 2. 
A number of demonstrations are planned for tomorrow to mark the first 
anniversary of the use of internment. INFORMATION POLICY 3. 
The local circulation of rumours, whether simply ill-founded and based 
on suspicion, or maliciously provoked for propaganda purposes, continues to be a problem meriting examination which will be best given in Northern Ireland. 
4. A second news-sheet, called "Death of a Village", dealing with reactions 
to the bombing of Claudy, has been produced and circulated by the Northern Ireland Office. 
YOUTH 5. 
A number of ideas have been put forward for dealing with the hooligan 
problem. These include the channelling of resources into recreational activities, community relations work, and liaison between the security forces and local communities as well as the possibility of penalising the parents of youths found guilty of breaching the peace. But there might be advantage in some expert advice being obtained. INTERROGATION 6. 
A possible new directive on interrogation procedures is still being 
considered by the Northern Ireland Office and Ministry of Defence. FIREARMS 7. 
Proposals are being prepared today by the Northern Ireland Office 
on the subject of lawfully held firearms in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office will consult the Foreign and Commonwealth Office about the possibility that Mr Lynch should be informed in advance of any statement of policy that is likely to become public.

7 AUGUST 1972 
The Secretary of State Mr Steele Mr McDowall 
Mr Cooper Mr Currie Mr Devlin. Mr Fitt Mr Hume Mr Jacottet Mr O’Hanlon Mr McGrady 
Mr Fitt said that the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had taken a major decision in agreeing to see the Secretary of State in the face of great difficulties. Up to now their attitude had been not to talk until internment was ended. Internment had been widely condemned by politicians from all sides as immoral and contrary to British democracy. It had polarised the community and inflamed passions. Even now the SDLP would be criticised for talking while internmnt continued. But the campaign of terror by the Provisional IRA, especially on ’Bloody Friday’, had convinced the SDLP that they should not allow themselves to be held as hostages to the IRA and internment. The SDLP had always condemned barricades as a symbol of a sick society. 
But Operation Motorman 
had convinced the minority community that harsh military tactics would be adopted against them alone. There had been tanks in the Creggan and the Bogside on the one hand; friendship between the Army and the UDA and the voluntary removal of their barricades on the other. The SDLP had been criticised for providing the Army by their earlier statement with a blank cheque to go into the Roman Catholic areas in strength. Both the Secretary of State and Mr Maudling when Home Secretary had repeatedly referred to the need to retain internment for security reasons, implying that when the security situation was satisfactory the en would no longer be held as hostages. Operation Motorman had put the Protestant community into a state of euphoria and provided the Secretary of State with an opportunity to make a reciprocal gesture by ending internment. The SDLP considered that most Protestants would now agree that there was no longer any reason for internment. Operation Motorman

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 040700 TO 070700 AUGUST 72 GENERAL 1. 
The most notable featne of the weekend is the build up of the propaganda 
war against the Army domination of Catholic areas. The rioting and attacks on the Roger Casement Park location on Sunday are a violent continuation of hard core Catholic protest which has been going on all week. Whatever the effect on public opinion in Britain this violence has contributed to the indicisiveness of the SDLP over talks with Mr Whitelaw. On the other extreme there have been a number of cases of UDA demonstrations in uniform, while Loyalist marches have taken place peacefully. There has been an increase in bombing and mining incidents mostly in the rural and border areas in one of these two soldiers of 4 Fd Regt were killed and two injured. There are newspaper reports of Provisional IRA volunteers returning from Buncrana in Donegal to the Londonderry area. In spite of their somewhat newscatching incidents the Province has been relatively quiet with a low level of shooting incidents and of trouble generally. 
2. During Fri/Sat 4/5 AUG There were 18 shooting incidents, 15 of which 
involved Security Forces. There were 8 explosions. LCPL CARD of 1 RGJ who was shot in the neck by a sniper early on the morning of 4 Aug 72, died of his wounds. 3 other members of 1 RGJ were wounded (not seriously) whilst inspecting a booby-trapped garage. An RUC Constable was wounded in Londonderry and 2 civilians were wounded in Belfast. The body of a man (RC) who had been shot in the head, was found in a pond to the North of Portadon. There were several good finds of arms and ammunition. 3 UDA marches took place in Belfast without incident, and 32 UDA, members were seen training in Comber.: 
r 3. During Sat/Sun 5/6 AUG There were 16 shooting incidents, 8 of which 
involved Security Forces. There were no military casulaties but one civilian (RC) was wounded and Security Forces claimed to have hit 2 gunmen. There were 6 explosions and ATO dismantled a 30-50 lb bomb. The Loyalist marches took place without serious incident and there were several arms/explosives finds. Londonderry had a very quiet day with only one shooting incident and 2 peaceful, pro-IRA meetings. There was a large (150-200 lb) explosion in Portglenone and a booby-trapped landrover was found near Coalisland. 
4. During Sun/Mon 6/7 AUG There were 13 shooting incidents, 8 of which 
involved Security Forces. There were 2 explosions, one of which, a claymore, killed 2 soldiers and injured 2 others (one is VSI) near Lisnaskea. ATO disposed of a 375 lb bomb near Aldergrove. In an incident in Belfast 2 rockets were fired at a Security Force location and caused 5 minor casulaties. 6 soldiers were hurt after a protest meeting at the Roger Casement Park had developed into a riot. One unidentified civilian was found shot dead in East Belfast.

7th August 1972 My Secretary of State feels that there would be advantage 
in having a meeting of GEN 79 towards the end of this week to take stock of the situation in Northern Ireland before the weekend and before Ministers begin to disperse for the holidays. Subject to the agreement of No 10, I should be grateful if you would explore this possibility. The CGS will be returning from Northern Ireland at midday on Thursday and from this point of view it might be convenient if the meeting were held late on Thursday or early on Friday. Even if the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is not in London, Lord Carrington still feels that it would be useful to have a short meeting. 
I am copying this letter to Armstrong at No 10, Graham at 
the FCO, Bailey at the Treasury, Platt at the NI Office, Rucker in the Lord President’s Office and Warren in the Chief Whip’s Office.

7th August, 1972 INTERROGATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND Robert Armstrong’s letter of 4.th August conveyed the Prime 
Minister’s approval to the proposed directive on interrogation by the Security Forces in Northern Ireland, subject to a number of modifications and to the approval. of the Defence Secretary. 
Lord Carrington, while appreciating the military case for 
interrogation as a means of obtaining maximum information, is apprehensive about the political implications of reverting to a procedure which will involve the removal of persons to a special place for the purpose of lengthy interrogation, the nature of which is bound to be misrepresented. He has asked the CGS, who is going to Northern Ireland tomorrow, to discuss the matter further with the GOC and 
and I believe that he will himself 
wish to have a word with Mr Whitelaw on the telephone before finally making up his mind. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Robert Armstrong. (R J ANDREW) T C Platt Esq

For Whalley from Cairncross. Please let the Secretary of State have the following as soon as possible as it is intended to answer the Question to-day. 
v 
Mr. J. Enoch Powell (Wolverhampton, South-West): To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, whether he has at any time signed any documents purporting to be, or capable of being represented as, an agreement with any part of the Irish Republican Army. 
DRAFT REPLY I signed no truce or agreement jointly with any part of 
the IRA: and the assertions in Der Spiegel, to which my rt. Hon. Friend no doubt refers are inventions. On 
when I 
reported to the House that the Provisional IRA had announced an unconditional cease fire, I said that the security forces would reciprocate. 
position ease 
fire was set out in a note, which was shown to an intermediary. The reciprocation by the security forces amounted to their not using the cease fire to carry out raids and searches. Otherwise their position was unaffected.

summary report of the points raised when the Secretary of State saw the Prime Minister this morning. 
swung round again and were once again demanding the end of internment as a condition of talking to him. He explained why he could not end internment, though he might be able to release some more internees. He said that he would ask Dr. Hillery, when he met him later in the day, to put pressure on the S.D.L.P. to talk first and if necessary rumble afterwards rather than try to impose pre-conditions for talks. 
The Secretary of State said that the S.D.L.P. had The Secretary of State talked about the need to 
control the border more closely than at present. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State agreed 
that it was clear from Mr. Lynch’s message ard the Prime Minister’s talk with the Irish Ambassador, that the Government of the Republic wanted to be involved in the talks about the future of Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister hoped that the Secretary of State would make no concessions at all to Dr. Hillery: anything that was done should be done between himself and Mr. Lynch. 
There was some discussion about interrogation and 
intelligence. The Secretary of State outlined his thoughts about 
(i) 
proportional representation, controlling health, education, agriculture, commerce and (at least to some extent) finance.

(ii) Responsibility for the police and the prison service (and possibly for some other "law and order" functions) to remain with Viestminster.

Reference: A. A/BR/30/1/M04 dated 2 Aug 1972. 1. 
Headquarters Northern Ireland weekly operational summary for the week ending 2 Aug 1972 was circulated under Reference A. 
2. 3. 
The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. The weekly intelligence report as at 4 Aug 1972 has been 
issued separately. Outlook 4. 
An 
updating of the summary up to 0800hrs Friday 4 Aug 1972 is attached at Annex A. 
There is no reason to disbelieve the Provisional IRA 
announcement that they intend to continue with guerilla activities. A major requirement of this must be to regain Catholic support, probably by propaganda or attempting to provoke the Security Forces into over-reaction. Attempts to sustain sectarian tension is another likely tactic. A continuation of car bomb attacks which can be mounted from their temporary bases must also be expected. 
5. Despite pressures from some of their own elements, the Official 
IRA is likely to maintain the ceasefire and to continue to lobby for participation in political talks through the Republic Clubs. Demonstrations can always be mounted through NICRA, in which it has a controlling element. 
6. Protestant reactions after Operation MOTORMAN are likely to 
be more relaxed and designed not to interfere with the Security Forces. The possibility exists that sectarian assassinations by small groups of extremists may continue, but that the leadership of the main Protestant organisations will attempt to curb this activity in their own interests.

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY DATED 2 AUGUST 1972 UPDATING AS AT 0800 HRS FRIDAY 4 AUGUST 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
Phase II of Operation MOTORMAN is now well under way moving gradually 
into Phase III with searches and RUC/RMP patrols evident in all hard previously IRA dominated areas. Searches have also taken place in Protestant enclaves and though arrests in both communities have been selective, restricted to those on which there is good intelligence, nevertheless subsequent finds have been considerable. Since the operation, Londonderry has remained entirely quiet though in Belfast the number of incidents are increasing daily which suggests that the gunmen remained in Belfast and are beginning now to recover their weapons from hiding. Over the last two days there have been 46 shooting incidents and 7 bomb attacks throughout the Province. Activity in the border areas has increased with explosions at Brookborough, Newry, Belleek and Strabane and shooting incidents in Rosslea and Belleek and elsewhere. 
2. There is evidence that the Provisionals have initiated a propaganda 
campaign to seize the initiative from the Security Forces but in almost every case hostile comment has been either preempted or countered by careful presentation of the facts by the informatin agencies. 
3. On the political front SDLP who are due to meet the Secretary of State 
next week appealed yesterday for restraint whilst political action continues "We are fully concious that political action is the only solution to the present impasse". Mr Heath is reported to have told the Irish Ambassador that though grateful for all the help that Mr Lynch could give towards a settlement the problem remained essentially one for the people of the North and that therefore there was little sign of HMG relaxing its opposition to the Republic joining Mr Whitelaw’s conference on the future of the North. The victory of the Fianna Fail candidate in the Mid-Cork by election (20, 214 votes) was described as a complete endorsement of Mr Lynch’s policies on the Northern situation and on indication that the people of the 26 counties were entirely opposed to the violence carried out in the North by the IRA. Had Fianna Fail lost this pro-Government constituency there was every likelihood of a general election. 
3 Infantry Brigade 4. 
On Wednesday one UDR soldier was critically injured and three others 
were treated for shock and cuts when a terrorist claymore exploded beside their Shorland armoured car. Wires leading from the scene led to a point just inside the North where a car battery was found. The Gardai later found a mini close by without a car battery, there investigations continue. A policeman and six people were hospitalised with slight injuries after a car bomb exploded last night near an Army post in Newry. Earlier a 150 lb car bomb had caused extensive damage in Brookborough. Warnings were given in both cases. There have been a number of finds in selective searches including a small find yesterday at the UDA Headquarters in Portadown.

August 1972 
N F Cairncross Esq CB Northern Ireland Office 
It was, as you know, a part of the concept of Operation 
MOTORMAN that, once the Security Forces had occupied and dominated the "no-go" areas, the intelligence obtained through interrogation would be a major factor in the neutralisation of the IRA. 
To be effective, the resources 
available to carry out interrogation need to be concentrated; and there needs to be adequate means of recording, evaluating and disseminating for tactical intelligence purposes statements made as a result of the questioning that is carried out. In the view of the GOC, interrogation following 
Operation MOTORMAN cannot be effectively carried out simply by using the existing facilities at RUC Police Stations. The subjects selected for interrogation would be those who come under suspicion, for one reason or another, but against whom no criminal charge can be brought. 
They would be held, 
initially, in Police Stations in various parts of the Province, where the resources of skilled interrogators cannot effectively be brought to bear on them and where no means at present exist for the evaluation and dissemination of the intelligence obtained. 
The GOC therefore advises, and the Ministry of 
Defence endorses this advice, that the RUC should be authorised to establish three Police Offices for the purposes of interrogation 
- one in Ballykelly (for Londonderry), one 
in RUC premises at Castlereagh (for Belfast) and one in Armagh for the country areas. 
who have been selected at RUC Stations should be brought to one or other of these Police Offices for further questioning, for a period which might Secretary of State - 
- subject to the authority of the extend up to 5 days. The GOC proposes that likely subjects

Ref ’A’: Directive on Interrogation by the Armed Forces in Internal Security Operations (JIC(A)(72)21 dated 29 June) 
INTRODUCTION 
1. Following the occupation and domination of dissident areas by the security forces under Op MOTORMAN, the key to the final neutralisation of the IRA, and to the necessary selectivity in arrest and search operations by the Security Forces, is good intelligence. In operations in Northern Ireland interrogation has always provided the best intelligence for the Security Forces. 2. Interrogation isdefined as the systematic extraction of information from a willing, or unwilling, subject who has been specially selected as likely to be able to provide useful information. 
In addition, the interrogation system is concerned 
with the whole period from arrest or capture to final discharge from an Interrogation Centre. 
3. Codeword Op SHAFTO is the codeword meaning the Interrogation operation forming part of Op MOTORMAN. The codeword is RESTRICTED. Its meaning is CONFIDENTIAL, with the caveat UK EYES ONLY. 
4. Ref A sets out the general principles on which interrogation in internal security operations is to be based. In operations in Northern Ireland it is to be applicable to both the RUC and to the rmy or other services concerned. 
The aim of this instruction, which supplements Ref A, is to set

There were 10 shootings, six of them at the Security 
a. Roger Casement Park. The Roger Casement Park area featured in allthe incidents in Andersonstown reported during the period. At 1147hrs a blast bomb was thrown outside a shop opposite the Park. During the evening a crowd of some 200 gathered outside the Park and were addressed by an unidentified man. Shortly after 2100hrs the crowd broke into the Park through a aide gate and destroyed a sangar. They staged a sit down protest but started to stone troops who attempted to move them. 190 baton rounds were fired and during the affrey the Battery Commander received a fractured cheek bone when he was struck with a spanner. Peter McLOUGHLAN(17) 33 Ramoan Gdns, was arrested and charged with causing grevious bodily harm.

d. Shortly before 1000hrs in Ballymacarrett two workers at the SIROCOO Factory were slightly wounded when six rounds were fired from Seaforde St. There was an immediate reaction. The factory workers walked out and threatened to take punitive action against the local catholic population. The ARLAND and HOLFE workers threatened to come out in sympathy. Security Forces were deployed in strength in the area and although there was some stoning and streets were blocked, the situation quietened down. The labour force did not return to work other than to pick up their belongings with a Security Force escort. 30 Catholics caught in a local Protestant area were also safely escorted out by Security Forces.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND I should be very grateful for a progress report 
on the state of your thinking on constitutional developments in Northern Ireland. There seem to me to be two problems here. First., we must be ready for a situation in which 
your political talks need to be provided with raw material. We can hardly expect that the talks will themselves generate clear and well worked out proposals. They may produce some general ideas; and you may well need to be in a position where you can bring forward specific proposals, possibly at short notice, to meet some vague and general expression of aim in the talks. Second, we need to have clearly in mind what we 
will ourselves want to achieve in this field, if the talks break down without a solution being reached and it becomes necessary for us to impose some form of constitutional settlement. Here again, time is not necessarily on our side: we shall need to be able to move quickly if the psychological situation demands it; and we must assume that we shall want to be able 
to bring forward our own constitutional proposals in

At Lurgan a house thought to be booby trapped was found in the Kilwilkie Estate. It was being watched until an ATO can deal with it. 
REPUBLIC 
5. Mr Lynch said yesterday that he considered the military occupation of the To Go areas was an escalation of the tension, but as its purpose was to save lives it was welcome. A political solution was now urgent. Meanwhile he would continue to take action against terrorists in the South. The South Cork bye-election takes place today. The Officials have announced that they will not resume hostilities but will ostracise 
British Troops.

2nd August, 1972 18/2/28 The Attorney General has now considered Sir William 
Nield’s paper on preventive detention for terrorist conduct, to which you referred in your Minute of the 31st July. 
The Attorney has noted that the paper rejects any 
suggestion of the creation of a new criminal offence capable of trial within the jurisdiction of the ordinary criminal courts. It envisages rather that persons against whom there is insufficient evidence to secure a conviction under the criminal law (including the Special Powers Act provisions) should nevertheless be detained if their conduct has involved them in "complicity in any degree with terrorism generally". The ordinary rules of evidence will not be applied and the normal rights of an accused person in the criminal courts will not be available to him. A decision on whether a person is "guilty" would be made by persons acting on hearsay in the exercise of their discretion. In effect, this would be a substitution of the administrative decision of (now) the Secretary of State by the decision of a committee. 
In these circumstances the Attorney regards it as 
wholly inappropriate to describe the body which is to impose preventive detention as "a court", or to speak of a case being proved against the accused. The Detention Order would depend on the arbitrary decision of this committee which would presumably not be required to state the grounds of their decision. Thus any system of appeal to the High Court would be very difficult if not impossible. 
Such committees (which could be described as tribunals) 
would accordingly be acting under no presently acceptable process of law; they would not be within the tradition of the courts and could hardly be manned by judges whose constitutional duties would make them wholly inappropriate to operate the proposed system. Clearly the Lord Chancellor would have to be consulted if there was any question of judges manning such tribunals. 
C. W. Roberts, Esq.

The Attorney minutes that even in 1940 in the 
United Kingdom there were courts (admittely sitting in camera) which administered the criminal law (e.g., in the cases of spies); and a wholly separate administrative procedure whereby, on the authority of a Minister, persons suspected of disaffection were detained under Regulation 18B. 
The "special courts" now operating in the Republic 
are in fact courts, and they proceed under the rule of law and the rules of evidence. They dispense however with the need for a jury and are manned by selected judges. The reason, apparently, for these courts is: 
(a) lack of confidence in some of their judges, and (b) lack of confidence in their juries. 
Neither of these conditions prevail in Northern Ireland. Some of the process of the special courts in the Republic is in camera, but counsel and solicitors for the accused remain in court and the burden of proof and the rules of evidence remain. 
In the opinion of the Attorney General it would be 
possible to provide by legislation for the establishment of a procedure whereby persons would be subject to preventive detention on the exercise of the discretion of a tribunal which was satisfied that the persons brought before it had been concerned with terrorism. There could also be provided an appeal from such a tribunal to an appellate tribunal, but the creation of such a system for the imposition of preventive detention would require an Act of Parliament. 
I am copying this letter to the recipients of yours 
Minute, and to Kenneth Jones (Home Office), Neil Cairncross (Northern Ireland Office) and Arthur Hockaday (Cabinet Office). 
C. W. Roberts, Esq., 10 Downing Street, 
London, S.W.1.

YOUR TEL NO 8. NORTHERN IRELAND. FOLLOWINGS MESSAGE DATED 1 AUGUST ADDRESSED TO THE 
PRIME MINISTER BY THE POPE. 
BEGINS. WE HAVE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE WHICH YOUR EXCELLENCY KINDLY SENT ON JULY 30TH LAST TO INFORM US ABOUT THE EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES WHICH HAVE BEEN DECIDED ON BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO PREVENT THE REPETITION IN NORTHERN IRELAND OF THE LAMENTABLE ACTS OF TERRORISM WHICH HAVE SO SHOCKED PUBLIC OPINION AND SO SADDENED US IN THESE DAYS. 
YOU HAVE ALSO ASSURED US OF THE 
UNALTERED DETERMINATION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO WORK FORPEACE AND RECONCILIATION BETWEEN ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE PROVINCE. 
IN THANKING YOUR EXCELLENCY FOR YOUR COURTESY, WE WOULD LIKE 
TO EXPRESS OUR GREAT HOPE AND CONFIDENCE THAT, IN CARRYING OUT THESE MEASURES; EVERY CARE WILL BE TAKEN TO AVOID ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF FURTHER EMBITTERING ATTIDUDES AND WIDENING THE CONTRASTS AND THE DIVISIONS. 
WE REFER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL, 
WHICH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, HAVING ASSUMED DIRECT RULE IN NORTHERN IRELAND, NOTICEABLY ATTENUATED, UNDERSTANDING WELL THE DEEP RESENTMENT WHICH THE MEASURE CAUSED IN ONE SECTION OF THE POPULATION, AND THE GRAVE HARDSHIP WHICH IT CAUSED TO INDIVIDUALS AND TO FAMILIES. 
WHILE WE ONCE AGAIN DEPLORE THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO OBTAIN 
THE RECOGNITION AND DUE RESPECT FOR PEOPLE’S RIGHTS, WE ENCOURAGE THE EFFORTS OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND OF ALL MEN OF GOOD WILL AIMED AT ELIMINATING THE DEEP CAUSES OF A SOCIAL AND CIVIL MALAISE WHICH HINDERS THE PACIFICATION OF MINDS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HARMONIOUS RELATIONS AMONG THE PEOPLE.

1 AUGUST M I P T. 
1. WHEN HE HANDED ME THIS TEXT, MR LYNCH MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS, WHICH HE SAID HE PARTICULARLY WANTED TO UNDERLINE. (A) AT THIS MORNING’S CABINET MEETING HIS GOVERNMENT HAD DECIDED TO ACCEPT AND GO ALONG WITH HMG’S ACTION. HIS AIM WAS TO ENSURE THAT THE COURSE ON WHICH WE HAD EMBARKED SUCCEEDED, BUT THIS ENTAILED UNDERSTANDING FULLY ALL THE POLITICAL PITFALLS NORTH AND SOUTH. (B) BY SOME MEANS OR ANOTHER THE IRISH GOVERNMENT HAD TO BE SEEN TO BE IN ON THE ACT. I QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ON THE WORDING OF HIS POINTS (D) AND (E). HE AGREED THAT WHILE EVERYTHING HE SAID AND DID HAD TO BE BASED ON THE HYPOTHESIS OF ULTIMATE REUNIFICATION, THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM WAS TO GET MINORITY LEADERS TALKING TO MR WHITELAW-- THE PHRASE ’’BY AGREEMENT’’ IN (D) GOVERNS THE WHOLE OF (E). THE NEXT STAGE, QUADRIPARTITE TALKS, WOULD DOUBTLESS EMERGE FROM THE SDLP SIDE IN THE INITIAL DISCUSSIONS. BUT HE INSISTED THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF PARTICIPATION OF THE IRISH GOVERNMENT AT SOME STAGE WAS BASIC TO THE TASK OF PERSUADING THE PEOPLE OF THE GHETTOES TO FOLLOW MODERATE LEADERS INSTEAD OF THE I R A.

(B) AS YOU WILL KNOW FROM THE CONVERSATION DR HILLERY HAD WITH MR WHITELAW ON THE 21ST JULY MY COLLEAGUES GIVE NO COUNTENANCE TO THE PROVSIONAL IRA AS A MATTER OF DECIDED GOVERMENT POLICY. WE QUITE AGREE THAT POLITICAL PROGRESS IS SERIOUSLY DISAFFECTED BY THEIR EXISTENCE.

(D) YOU ARE AWARE OF COURSE OF MY GENERAL ViEWS WHICH I BELIEVE I STATED CLEARLY IN A NUMBER OF SPEECHES AND WITH DELIBERATE DETAIL IN MY RECENT ’’FOREIGN AFFAIRS’’ ARTIICLE. THE PRINCIPAL UNDERLYING VIEW IS THAT THE DOOR TO IRISH UNITY, BY AGREEMENT, MUST BE UNLOCKED. THIS VIEW IS ALSO SHARED BY THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP OF THE MINORITY IN THE NORTH. 
(E) WITHIN THIS PRINCIPLE OUR GOVERNMENTS SHOULD USEFULLY BE ABLE TO DISCUSS THE WHOLE MATTER IN DEPTh AND TO USE THE INFLUENCE WE EACH HAVE WITH THE VARIOUS SECTIONS OF POLITICAL OPINION IN THE NORTH TO FIND WAYS AND MEANS OF ENDING VIOLENCE, OF PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK FOR ADMINSTRAION IN THE NORTH WHOSE MAIN PURPOSE MUST BE TO RECONCILE THE COMMUNITIES THERE AN OF MOVING ON TO LONG TERM SOLUTIONS AS THE OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES MY GOVERN-

YOUR MEETING WITH MR LYNCH IN MUNICH NEXT MONDAY THE IRISH CHARGE D’AFFAIRES TELEPHONED AT MID MORNING 
T 0 ASK ON INSTRUCTIONS ( WHICH HE SAID HAD COME ORIGINALLY FROM MR LYNCH) FOR OUR AGREEMENT TO YOUR MEETING IN MUNICH BEING ANNOUNCED AT 
PM TODAY. I SAID THAT YOU HAD 
GONE OUT SAILING AND I COULD NOT CONTACT YOU UNTIL THE AFTERNOON. 
HE ACCEPTED THIS, BUT ASKED THAT THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD BE MADE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND IN ANY CASE IN TIME FOR TOMORROW MORNING’S PAPERS. 
SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAD REASON TO THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE A LEAK 
, HE ALSO AND I SUSPECT THAT THE NEWS IS GOING TO 
APPEAR IN TOMORROW’S IRISH PAPERS IN ANY CASE. IT IS ANNOYING TO BE BOUNCED BY THE IRISH LIKE THIS 
PARTICULARLY SINCE IT WAS THEY WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY PARTICULARLY KEEN THAT THE MEETING SHOULD NOT BE ANNOUNCED IN ADVANCE. IT IS ALSO UNFORTUNATE TIMING THAT WE SHOULD BE ASKED TO ANNOUNCE A MEETING WITH MR LYNCH ON THE DAY AFTER WE HAVE ANNOUNCED ONE WITH THE SDLP. 
MR PAISLEY HAS ALREADY 
ASKED FOR A MEETING WITH YOU AND I BELIEVE THAT MR WHITELAW WILL ADVISE THAT THIS REQUEST SHOULD BE TURNED DOWN. 
THE 
UNIONISTS MAY FOLLOW SUIT. I HAVE CONSULTED DONALD MAITLAND AND DOUGLAS HURD. 
WE FEEL THAT SINCE THE MEETING SEEMS LIKELY TO BECOME PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE IN ANY CASE WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS, WE SHOULD MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT LATER THIS AFTERNOON JOINTLY WITH THE IRISH AND THUS AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL THE MEETING. 
DONALD MAITLAND 
PROPOSES THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD BE MADE AT 1830 HOURS, TOO LATE FOR THE 6 PM NEWS. 
THE PRESS OFFICE WOULD SAY THAT SINCE YOURSELF AND 
MR LYNCH WILL BE IN MUNICH FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE ARRANGED TO SEE HIM FOR A DISCUSSION ON MONDAY MORNING. 
THEY WILL REMIND ENQU RERS THAT YOU 
HAD MET SIMILARLY IN BRUSSELS IN JANUARY: AND WOULD POINT OUT AS APPROPRIATE THAT BECAUSE OF YOUR OTHER ENGAGEMENTS IN MUNICH. THIS WOULD NOT BE A LONG MEETING.) 
DO YOU AGREE THAT WE SHOULD PROCEED IN THIS WAY?

Your Personal Minute No M78/72 of 14 August referred to the possibility of the Official IRA resuming offensive operations, asked whether there were plans for dealing with this contingency and how good the relevant intelligence was. 
The intelligence organisation keeps a close watch on this. I attach a very recent assessment of the Official IRA’s tactics and the chances of their returning to offensive activity, as well as their relations with the Provisionals. 
While the Officials’ potential for violence is not tobe under-estimated there is nevertheless a significant difference between their attitude and that of the Provisionals. Many of the latter have come to regard violence virtually as an end in itself whereas for the Officials it is still very much a second-best (and possibly supplementary) method of achieving their objectives. Partly in response to the general Catholic mood and partly because they feel that violence as a method is less likely to achieve their objectives the Officials currently favour a political approach. If in the future Catholics felt that their hopes of constitutional changes had been blocked or the Officials came to think that they had exhausted political methods a return to the offensive by the Officials would be a real possibility. But the ability of the Officials to withstand the pressure after ’Motorman’ to end their ceasefire indicates the strength of their will to pursue political methods. 
This assessment is derived from overt and covert sources of information.

THE CURRENT POSITION OF THE OFFICIAL IRA (DELICATE SOURCE) 
The Official IRA announced nearly 3 months ago their intention to suspend offensive action. Their statement on 29 May reserved the right of selfdefence "if attacked by the British military or by sectarian forces In a statement issued shortly after the operation of 31 July against the ’no-go’ areas they re-affirmed their intention to refrain from offensive action. The Officials have in the past interpreted self-defence as including "retaliatory" attacks. So far as we know, however, no such attacks have taken place since the cease-fire, despite recent operations by the security forces. There is evidence that a few individual members of the Official IRA may on a few occasions have taken part in incidents involving the Provisionals, but the discipline of the group as a whole seems to have remained effective in ensuring compliance with the cease-fire. 
2. The political aims of the Official IRA have always been more complex 
than those of the Provisionals. In their statement of 29 May - the burden of which has since been repeated - the Officials said they would continue their political campaign, including civil disobedience, until their demands were met. These included the release of all internees, a general amnesty for "political prisoners", the abolition of the Special Powers Act, a declaration of freedom of political expression, and the withdrawal of troops to barracks pending their ultimate withdrawal from Northern Ireland. The Officials may feel that all of these demands except the last are at least within the bounds of possibility, and they have continued to press these short-term aims through their front organisations, such as the Republican clubs, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and so on. 
3. In the longer term the Officials hope to achieve a non-sectarian 
Workers Republic in the whole of Ireland. With this object in mind they have always been more willing than the Provisionals to envisage the possibility of working through the political institutions of Northern Ireland - 
as an intermediate measure - and to co-operate so far as they 
have been able with the Protestant working class. Their interest in penetrating the trades union movement and in industrial action is relevant in this regard. So, too, are the recent contacts they claim to have had with UDA members whom they apparently see as appropriate representatives of

Mr Howard-Drake Wanted List It is interesting to note that category III of the wanted list, which 
is defined by the RUC as: "Those holding key positions in terrorist organisations who are known to be responsible for the direction and performance of acts of violence by others, but against whom there is no evidence or intelligence of personal involvement" contains only 31 names. The Secretary of State’s warnings about the difficulties of further 
large scale internment and detention have clearly been taken to heart and as a result the list seems to have been carefully sifted to include only key figures. The list contains 11 Official IRA and presumably their inclusion will have to be reviewed if that organisation decides to continue its ceasefire. Category III contains no Protestant extremists.

Sir Graham Shillington CBE RUC Headquarters Brooklyn Knock Road Belfast BT5 6LB 
Ministers have now considered further the policy on arrests which is to be followed in present circumstances in Northern Ireland. 
The Secretary of State has asked me to send you the enclosed copy of a document setting this policy out, together with an annex which deals with the basic rules, requirements and methods to be followed during interrogation operations. May we now leave it to you to issue suitable instructions to members of th RUC so that the policy in these documents will be strictly observed? 
The document setting out the basic rules for interrogation operations should, as it makes clear, be read in conjunction with the "Directive on Interrogation to the Armed Forces in Internal Security Operations" which Woodfield sent you under cover of his letter of 2nd August 1972. I should perhaps stress that what is said in that letter stands.

15th August, 1972 INTERROGATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND There was as you know some confusion about the 
authorisation of the interrogation centres which were set up after the start of Operation MOTORMAN. The Ministers concerned subsequently agreed to the resumption of interrogation; but I understand that the Army in Northern Ireland feel that the full co-operation of the RUC will not be forthcoming until the new directive on Interrogation by the Security Forces in Northern Ireland has been issued to them. 
I believe that the final draft of this directive is 
now with your Secretary of State for approval. My own Secretary of State is content with the document so far as it concerns the Army’s contribution. 
I should be grateful 
for anything you can do to ensure that this directive, and the parallel one on Arrest Policy, are issued as soon as possible.

BGS (Int) 
NORTHERN IRELAND: INTERROGATION Your note of Secretary of State’s meeting yesterday records 
his comment that it was unsatisfactory that two interrogation centres should have been in operation since the start of MOTORMAN. 
afraid that the NIO have so far been unable to discover from their people in Belfast exactly what instructions were given by the Chief Constable to the RUC Special Branch about the scope of interrogation following Operation MOTORMAN - apart from the fact that, very soon after that Operation had begun, the NIO sent the Chief Constable a copy of the JIC Interrogation Directive with a covering note to say that the RUC were to follow its provisions. 
You asked me to take this up with the NIO. 2. Enquiries which BGS (Int) has made from HQNI have, however, 
thrown some more light. /As CGS’s minute to the Secretary of State dated Monday 31 July explained, it was at that stage planned to establish by about the middle of that week three Police Offices for the purposes of interrogation - in Ballykelly, Castlereagh and Armagh. 
In fact, the GOC had discussed the "interrogation phase" 
with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland early on the morning of 31 July; and his recollection is that Mr Whitelaw then agreed that the Army should provide administrative backing for interrogation to be carried out by the RUC Special Branch. Later, Mr Whitelaw did not confirm that such an agreement had been reached. 
But on the basis of the GOC’s recollection of 
this conversation, joint CID and Special Branch teams were apparently set up at various police stations in the province as a first step. 
which was set up as a new establishment, 
backing, because the Londonderry RUC station was not thought suitable for the purpose. 
At this stage, Castlereagh and 
Ballykelly functioned as screening centres rather than full Police Offices: people were questioned by the CID in the first place, with a view to charges being preferred, and those who were not to be charged were then questioned by the Special Branch to find out whether they would be suitable for extended interrogation. It was to carry out extended interrogation 
backing to sift and evaluate the material obtained - 
Offices were intended to be set up. 3. 
- with Army intelligence that Police 
telephone conversations on 2/3 August reported in MA/VCGS’s minutes of those dates. 
This was the position when the GOC and VCGS had the two The GOC evidently believed at this time 
that the SSNI had approved in principle the setting up of the Police Offices for extended interrogation, but both the GOC and the RUC were reluctant that extended interrogation should go ahead without a fuller directive than that which had already been paused on by the NIO. 
The only later development has been that

NORTHERN IRELAND The Secretary of State held a short internal meeting 
at 3.15 yesterday afternoon in preparation for a meeting of GEN 79 later in the afternoon. CGS, PUS, DUS(ARMY) and AUS(GS) were present. The following main points were discussed. 
General Situation 2. 
CGS, who had just returned from Northern Ireland, 
said that there was considerable unease there lest no solution emerged from the proposed political talks and the Security Forces found themselves in a weaker position by the end of the year. 
Preventive Detention 3. 
CGS said that there were differing views in Northern 
Ireland on arrest policy and on what to do with those who were arrested. It was noted that a case could be made for the introduction of preventive detention as being preferable to internment without trial; but legislation would be required, and S of S judged that this would present Parliamentary difficulties which would prevent early action. It was agreed that there would be advantage in pursuing other legal measures (proscription of terrorist organisations, stricter control of unlicenced vehicles etc.), which did not require Parliamentary action. It was agreed that the Cabinet Office paper on legal issues which was under preparation should make clear the distinction between these two categories. (I should be grateful if AUS(GS) would take action on this). 
Internment 4. 
CGS reported that the Secretary of State for Northern 
Ireland was anxious that all those at present interned should be released. The Army’s view was that this would not be disastrous, provided that the possibility of interning those who were arrested in future was kept open. S of S doubted whether this was realistic; the SDLP could hardly be expected

thought that the medical officer positively should not be present during the interrogation.

INTERROGATION BY SECURITY FORCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND In his minute of 8 August, DUS (Army) submitted a draft 
letter for DDGAMS to send to to ADMS Northern Ireland, RAMC personnel involved in interrogation. 
concernin He referred to the 
general directive on this subject which had been discussed between MOD and NIO officials, and to the further draft of this directive which the NIO were about to circulate for clearance. 
I have now received from the NIO their revised version of the general directive: a copy is attached. 
2. It does not differ 
greatly from the earlier draft which MOD Ministers had seen. 3. 
The NIO, in a covering letter, have explained that the final 
form of this document will be subject to the views of their Secretary of State, who will be likely to prefer to proceed by consultation with the RUC, rather than by "direction": the IO are also concerned that the document should avoid the danger of giving the RUC the impression that they are being told how to do their professional job. As to the document itself, the NIO evidently have some doubt regarding paragraphs 21 and 22. 
I 
propose to advise them to keep paragraph 21,subject to the minor drafting amendment shown at the beginning of it, since the rime Minister clearly thought it worth retaining the injunction to exclude any form of ill treatment and maintain strict discipline, although he asked for the deletion of references, in the earlier draft, to the different methods of interrogation. 
As regards th 
end of paragraph 22, the JIC directive lays it down that techniques such as the deliberate deprivation of sleep are prohibited, and that proper arrangements are to be made for the physical needs, including food and drink, of all persons being interrogated: we did not, in the context of the directive to be followed if the Armed Forces over had to undertake interrogation, consider specific 
that it was necessary or desirable to prescribe

INTERROGATION FOLLOWING OPERATION MOTORMAN In his minute of 31 July to the Secretary of State, CGS 
outlined the plan to establish three Police Offices for the purposes of interrogation - in Ballykelly (for Londonderry), at Cantlereagh (for Belfast) and in Armagh (for the country areas). 
The purpose of this plan was to concentrate the 
resources of skilled interrogators and to enable the information obtained from questioning to be sifted, evaluated and than disseminated for the purposes of tactical intelligence. 
This 
plan has been discussed between HQNI and the Head of the RUC Special Branch but, apparently because of a misunderstanding in Northern Ireland, steps were not taken to obtain the specific approval of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for the details of the plan. 
When we established that fact yesterday, 
Mr Whitelaw had already returned from Belfast to London; and VCGS therefore authorised me to send to the Northern Ireland Office a letter outlining the scope of the plan to set up three Police Offices, together with the draft of a directive that might be suitable both for the RUC Special Branch and for the Army (so far as they might be asked to provide administrative backing for the Police Offices). 
Copies are attached.. 2. Shortly afterwards, OGS took the opportunity that he had 
yesterday evening of seeing the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to raise with him the question of setting up the three Police Offices. 
As a result, Mr Whitelaw said that he intended 
to send to the Prime Minister the letter and tho draft directive as a basis for an early discussion between the Prime Minister, our Secretary of State and himself. 
But in doing so he would 
make it clear to the Prime Minister that, although these papers set out the issues for decision, there was no implied commitment on the part of 
Ministry of Defence Ministers themselves to approve the GOC’s proposal.

CGS MEETING WITH S OF S NI - PM 3 AUGUST 1972 1. 
CGS had an extremely satisfactory meeting with Mr Whitelaw 
on the evening of Thursday August 3rd to discuss particularly interrogation and preventive detention. Mr Cairncross was present throughout as Sir William Nield is on leave. 
2. Interrogation. CGS showed Mr Whitelaw AUS(GS)’s minute and 
the draft directive attached to it; you have copies of both of these. Mr Whitelaw said that he would send the paper and directive to the Prime Minister that evening, without commitment, saying that he had discussed them with the CGS and proposed to discuss them with him, the Prime Minister, on 4th August. He also intends to talk to S of S over the weekend saying that he accepts the need for extended interrogation, he accepts that this cannot be done in every Police Station and that he accepts the need to establish Police Offices in Castlereagh, to cover Belfast, and Ballykelly, to cover the 8 Brigade area, purely because there is no suitable Police Station in Londonderry itself. He is not, however, all that keen to establish a third Office at Armagh, but has not totally vetoed the idea and if necessary could be persuaded. He is, however, desperately concerned about the inevitable allegations of brutality which will arise but, if the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State agree with the establishment of these Offices, he will issue the directive to the Chief Constable without having a further Gen 79 meeting. As far as Gen 79 was concerned the earliest it could really be held was next Thursday, as Mr Whitelaw himself intended to be in his constituency on Friday. He said that Lord Balniel should be told that the paper had gone without commitment to the Prime Minister, and AUS(GS) did this. 
3. Preventive Detention. S of S NI would now put a paper to his 
colleagues saying that when Parliament reassembled it should have before it a paper on the Tribunal/Special Courts issue setting out the problem. Clearly no legal legislation could be put through in this session. 
In the meantime, however, he was perfectly prepared 
to make more extensive use of his powers to detain and would do so until the issue was discussed in the house. At the Gen 79 meeting towards the end of next week the NIO would produce a preliminary paper for discussion. 
4. CGS mentioned the difference between Regulation 11 of the 
Special Powers Act which allowed holding (and questioning) for an indefinite period and Regulation 10 which had a statutory 48 hour time limit; it was this time limit that had been extended to those held under Regulation 11, by usage rather than by statute.

I duly tracked down my opposite number in the Northern Ireland It 
proved impossible to establish within the NIO confirmation that SSNI had given approval for such interrogation, and I also encountered resistence to the idea that, even if he had, any further Directive should be issued of the kind suggested by the Ministry of Defence. I emphasised that we were not trying to do NIO’s business for them. but that neither the RUC nor the GOC were prepared to start interrogating short of an adequate Directive approved by Ministers - assuming that S of S Northern Ireland had approved interrogation in principle and that to the extent that the Army were involved in providing administrative support some form of agreed Directive was necessary in order that we might issue appropriate instructions governing the Army’s participation.

The NIO undertook to obtain a ruling from the SSNI this morning. further advice, but AUS(GS) 
will have told you that (in my own absence at GEN 96) he eventually succeeded in doing so. 
The SSNI, apparently, does not share the 
impression that he gave approval that interrogation should be conducte at the three Police Offices, and is adverse to any repetition of t h e past, 
even apparently, subject to the post-Parker safe- 
guards. 3.

seems to me the points to stress are that: a. 
As it We are not talking about any form of deep interrogation 
merely a system which will enable us effectively to apply limited interrogation and associated resources which would otherwise have to be dispersed to provide incomplete and ineffective cover at Police Stations throughout the province. 
b. It is nevertheless understandable that the Special Branch 
should not be prepared to start interrogating at Police Offices (nor the GOC to provide the proposed administrative support) short of a proper Directive from Ministers. 
c. The revised Part I interrogation Directive, which we under- 
stand has been passed by the NIO to the RUC, while adequate for the purposes for which it was devised (as a statement of 
principle which could be published if we were forced to do so),
