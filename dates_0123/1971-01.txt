NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 23 - 28 JANUARY, 1971. Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL SITUATION 1. 
The responsibility of Republican extremists for the 
disturbances in Ballymurphy (reported in last week’s HONIP) contrasted with the events, beginning on Friday night, when the Protestant Shankill resorted to violence. It is not thought that the Protestant disturbances were organised by extremists but that, irritated by the Ballymurphy riots, the acquittals in the murder and firearm trial of the Roman Catholic defendants and the defeat of their football club, they took to the streets spontaneously. The numbers involved were never so great, nor the situation so serious, as last September, when the Shankill erupted in somewhat similar circumstances (see HONIP(70) 40, paragraphs 2 to 6). 
2. The main interest during the week has centred on political 
events. Sensing, perhaps, a widespread discontent with the handling of the Ballymurphy disturbances, the right-wing dissident Unionists decided that this was the time to requisition a special meeting of the Unionist Council to consider a resolution calling for the resignation of the Government. The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland has not so far made any public comment on this development and he succeeded in holding off the hard-liners of the right in Wednesday’s debate on "law and order". The terms of the motion, which was in favour of the Government, illustrate, however, that the Primo Minister will continue to be under pressure from his supporters to take "tough" action against troublemakers. Lord Carrington and Mr. Sharples left for a two-day visit to Northern Ireland (see last week’s HONIP paragraph 4), on 28 January to assess the current security situation and review it with the security forces and the Northern Ireland Government. 
DISTURBANCES 3. 
The Protestant Shankill area of Belfast was the scene of 
disturbances over the weekend. On 22 January Protestants reacted to Catholic celebrations in Hooker Street over the acquittal of three local men (see paragraph 16) by throwing stones and building a barricade of cars across the Crumlin Road.

STATEMENT ON THE DISTURBANCES BY MAJOR CHICHESTER-CLARK ISSUED ON 24 JANUARY 
on the police and army. 
"Last night we saw in Belfast some extremely vicious attacks Eight casualties, one of them serious, 
was suffered by the RUC, 11 by the Army. "The recent riots in Ballymurphy and elsewhere made it clear 
that one major threat to Northern Ireland is the activity of people who wish to subvert and undermine lawful authority. Whatever the motives of those who were rioting last night on the Shankill they were, in practice, allying themselves with those people. 
However unwittingly, they were contributing to the 
achievement of the aims and objectives of those who would bring down the Government and overthrow the Constitution of Northern Ireland. 
against subversion and violent crime. I can imagine no activity more likely to give comfort 
and encouragement at this time to the enemies of Northern Ireland. "Every policeman who is hurt is taken out of the battle 
Every injury to a soldier 
is a weakening of Northern Ireland’s position as a part of the United Kingdom. 
"I want to make it very clear indeed that all that I have said 
about our determination to take vigorous measures against lawbreakers applied to everyone without exception."

MINISTRY OF DEFENCE MO 19/3 27th January 1971 You mentioned to me earlier today that you thought 
it would be useful to have a preliminary note on the infringement of the Eire border by a British Army patrol which occurred on the night of 25/26 January, and which was the subject of Dublin telegrams Nos. 20 and 21 and a report in today’s Daily Telegraph. 
Headquarters Northern Ireland is holding a full 
inquiry into the incident. But the main facts have already been established and are set out in the Annex to this letter. 
We see no particular difficulty about 
authorising the Ambassador in Dublin to repeat these facts in confidence to the Irish authorities; this point is being pursued between officials of MOD, FCO and the Home Office. We shall not of course be able to answer the Ambassador’s particular question, about whether disciplinary action is to be taken, until the inquiry has been completed. The Defence Secretary will certainly wish to know whether the arrangements for briefing newlyarrived Units need tightening up. 
I am sending copies of this letter to Nicholas Barrington, Graham Angel and Brian Norbury.

Shortly after midnight on 25/26 January two Ferret scout 
cars of 3 Parachute Regiment and two landrovers of 4 UDR accidentally crossed into Eire at the Mullan Customs Post. The order of the patrol was a Ferret in front and at the rear with the two land-rovers in the middle. (The Ferret leads in case the road is mined, since in such an event it will sustain less damage than a land-rover.) 3 Parachute Regt are new to Northern Ireland and the officer-in-charge of the patrol who was in the lead Ferret had not been to the Mullan Custom Post before. The second-in command of the patrol in the tail-end Ferret knew the area and recognized the custom post on approaching it. He immediately tried to make radio contact with the officer-incharge but was unable to do so. He therefore drove on past the post to the head of the patrol in order to stop their going any further into Irish territory. On the return journey the two UDR land-rovers, which had now taken the lead drove back without being stopped at the custom post. The noise of the Ferrets, however, alerted the customs officials who stopped the scout cars and detained them for about three quarters of an hour. Rain and mist contributed to the difficulties of a patrol new to the area.

REPORT ON NORTHERN IRELAND, WEEK-END 22-24 JANUARY 1971 Most of the trouble over the week-end occurred in the 
Protestant Shankhill area of Belfast although there were a number of minor incidents in Londonderry and Creggan and six explosive devices were discovered and disarmed before ignition in various parts of Belfast. 
In the Shankhill, trouble started on Saturday afternoon 
on dispersal of the crowd from the Linfield football ground where the local team had been beaten by a mainly Roman Catholic team. Trouble went on until the early hours of Sunday morning. Barricades were erected, and bottles and stones thrown. The focus of hostility was the Army and the RUC. The Army used rubber baton rounds in attempting to contain the disturbances and suffered 11 minor casualties. 
Early on the Sunday evening crowds again gathered and 
there was an attack on an RUC station. A number of arrests were made and by 1 a.m. on Monday morning the area was quiet. 
It was noticeable that during the disturbances no petrol 
bombs were thrown and there was no evidence of firearms. The trouble may well have been provoked by a combination 
of: 
a. the acquittal on Friday of three Roman Catholic defendants in a murder trial; 
b. the Linfield football result; 
c. the Catholic rioting in the Ballymurphy area during the week beginning 10th January. 
There is no evidence of the affair having been managed by extreme Protestants-from outside the area.

PRIME MINISTER 
Northern Ireland: Letters from Mr. Robin Chichester Clark and Mr. Stratton Mills 
You decided that the best way to handle representations 
you had fran Robin Chichester Clark and Stratton Mills would be for you to see them when you got back fran Singapore. They have been so informed, but in a way which leaves it open whether you will see them individually or together and whether you will merely have an informal contact with them in the House or offer them a more substantial meeting. The Home Secretary’s inclination will probably be that it might be preferable for you to see them separately. 
do not see eye to eye on certain matters; Stratton Mills is said to take a more balanced view. The Home Secretary wishes to go over the ground with you before you see them, and I assume you will want us to arrange this. The two letters are attached behind this note. 
Behind them are the various replies which have been received fran the Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office commenting on points raised. It may be helpful if I summarise the comments below, broadly in the order in which the points occur in the Chichester Clark letter.

From: THE PRIVATE SECRETARY 18th January 1971 The Prime Minister will wish to know the 
outcome of this afternoon’s discussion with Major Chichester-Clark. 
The meeting was a lengthy one, and the only decision was that Lord Carrington should 
make a visit to Northern Ireland in the very near future. 
I enclose a telegram from me to Robert 
Armstrong which gives the background to that decision. 
I also enclose a copy of the communique. G. L. ANGEL Peter Gregson, Esq.

TELEGRAM FROM GRAHAM ANGEL TO ROBERT ARMSTRONG Major Chichester-Clark, with Mr. Faulkner and Senator Andrews, came 
to see the Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Defence this afternoon. 
The meeting was arranged at the urgent request of the Northern 
Ireland Government, who were flapping because of disorders in past week in Ballymurphy. 
not compare in any way with earlier troubles but their persistence has intensified political pressure from the Right Wing. 
One suggestion was more searches for arms. These disorders have involved only small numbers and do Major Chichester- 
Clark suggested more firmness by the military without any clear idea of what should be done. 
It 
was agreed that Lord Carrington would make an early visit to Northern Ireland to consider the situation there. 
The visitors departed much calmer than they arrived, though their attitude will depend on whether there is renewed disturbances in the next few days. 
This is being announced tonight. Signs are that army is getting greater control of the 
situation; Saturday and Sunday have been much better than earlier nights in the week.

There has been intermittent rioting, provoked it is 
suspected by Brady group members of the IRA, in the Ballymurphy (Catholic) area of Belfast for most of the week. Attempts at barricade building have been made, crowds of up to about 200 have gathered 
- sometimes composed almost entirely of women and children - and 
stones, petrol bombs and, a new device, acid bombs have been thrown. Last night (14/15 Jan) shots were fired at a military platoon, resulting in one minor casualty. This is the most serious rioting which has occurred in Belfast since the end of October, 1970, when there was considerable trouble in another Catholic area, the Ardoyne. The scale of this recent rioting in Ballymurphy has so far been of very much lower intensity, however, than was experienced either at the end of October or at the end of June and beginning of July.
