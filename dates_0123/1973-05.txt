As far as Reference A is concerned CGS understood from HQ 
mentioned in Reference A are swept up in the examination of the HQ Northern Ireland paper, as HQ Northern Ireland themselves may perhaps favour the reduction of one resident battalion in Ebrington Barracks. 
2. As far as Reference B and the Northern Ireland elections stand-by 
battalions are concerned, CGS believes that there should be no need for a second stand-by battalion after the June election.

Time Zone used throughout this Instruction: ALFA 1. SITUATION a. General 
(1) Local Government Elections (LGE) are to take place throughout Northern Ireland on 30 May 1973. They are significant because this is the first time since the last General Election, and the start of the current troubles, that the electorate has had the opportunity to vote for representative councils in Local Government. It is also significant that the election will be conducted on a system of Proportional Representation for the first time since the 1920s. 
(2) The LGE will be based on the 26 MacRory Districts; once elected, the District Councils will come into operation on 1 October 1973. 
(3) The period of the LE may be split into 4 phases as in paragraph 3a. 
(4) There will be 590 polling stations throughout the Province (see Annex A) and polling will take place from 0800 hrs to 2000 hrs on 30 May 1973. Postal voting facilities will be available as for the Border Poll and each Electoral Area is being contested. Counting of votes will take place at the premises listed at Annex B. 
(5) Polling staff will be issued with an identification badge and a letter of appointment. Political agents will carry a letter of appointment only. 
(Specimens to follow). 
b. The Threat An assessment of the threat to security at the LGE is at Annex C. In summary, the threat is considered to be: 
(1) A concerted campaign of disruption of the LGE is unlikely though the PIRA 
conduct of the elections and may take advantage of SF commitments polling day by launching attacks elsewhere. 
will probably take every opportunity to interfere with the

BATON ROUND INCIDENT ON 18 MAY 1973 IN WHICH THOMAS FRIEL ALLEGEDLY RECEIVED HEAD INJURIES LEADING TO HIS DEATH ON 23 MAY 1973 
INCIDENT 1. 
During the afternoon and evening of 17 May there were numerous incidents 
of stoning and hooliganism in the Creggan area of Londonderry Three soldiers were injured by stones and bottles. During a follow up to these incidents a SF section was ordered to investigate 3 people acting suspiciously in Balbane Pass at 180055 May.

2. The section returned and while observing the junction of Blighs Lane and 
Creggan Heights saw 40 - 50 youths congregating there. A small group of youths broke away and moved along Blighs Lane towards the patrol which by now had been reinforced by another section and ar officer. Stones and bottles were thrown at the patrol injuring one soldier who was taken back to Creggan Camp By now the crowd had almost surrounded the patrol which was ordered to advance towards the main group of 50 - 60 youths at the junction.

22 May, 1973 In my letter of 9 May I gave you a press port on 
Irish reactions to the Prime Minister’s approac of 13 April to Mr. Cosgrave about the need for co-operation on IRA CrossBorder activity. The general conclusion was "so far so good", though we then awaited the Irish response to our suggestion of further meetings. 
We have now received the Irish response. They are obviously 
concerned lest word of the co-operation they are ready to provide should leak and be seized upon by the opposition. They therefore emphasised the need for total secrecy; and when considering regular meetings of officials as a means of ensuring effective co-operation, they preferred, in their own words, to "mute down the method but provide the service". 
In addition to the two channels set out above, we had hoped 
that the Irish Government would instruct their Army and the Gardai to consult regularly with our units and the RUC. It appears that no such specific instruction will be given. But Mr. Cosgrave’s wishes are obviously well-understood, and the Irish authorities on the Border have scented the wind of change; the Security Forces report a considerable improvement in co-operation. Shootings along the Border have decreased markedly, and the IRA are concentrating on placing bombs, which are harder for the authorities on both sides to detect. Ad hoc meetings between the two sides are

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 110700 TO 140700 HRS MAY 1973 GENERAL 1. 
The weekend passed relatively quietly except for several serious incidents. 
With the SF involved in a rather loer proportion of shooting incidents than recently the actual level of shootings was similar to last weekend (28 incidents SF involved in 18 compared with 32/30 last weekend). Explosions numbered 8 compared with 14. 
An RUC constable was severely injured when a booby trapped bomb in his 
car near Queen’s University exploded on Friday. Cpl Taylor 2LI was killed and 3 other members of a patrol are VSI after a command detonated claymore device exploded on Sunday when they were investigating a disused factory in the St James area of Belfast after an anonymous call. 
There were several incidents of intersectarian violence including violent 
disturbances in Ligoniel on Sunday evening. A welfare worker (RC) was shot in the Lower Falls, a Protestant and a Catholic were shot in Belfast on Saturday and two young Protestants were wounded on Sunday. A Protestant bomb exploded outside a bar in the Sandy Row area of Belfast causing a number of injuries. are 
a number of bombing incidents in the rural and border areas. 
On Friday the Gardai in a notable piece of cooperation with SF found the firing point for a cross border device South of Newry, arrested three men (thought to be Official IRA) and dealt with the charges in conjunction with ATO. In an incident near Coag (Cookstown) a van burst through a UDR VCP and after SF opened fire crashed, the occupant having died of a bullet wound. The full circumstances of this incident are not yet clear although It is thought that gunmen did open fire on the VCP. 
Londonderry was queit throughout the weekend apart from a bomb in the 
Strand Rd on Saturday which caused a serious fire. There were however 3 other bombs defused by ATO. 
Press interest over the weekend centred on the activities of plain clothes 
operations and especially of Army double agents. The story of Ranger Hammond a deserter from 2 R IRISH captured the headlines and is likely to be the subject of further press specualtion. Much of the material which might have been used in any way in connection with the case which will soon be heard against Sgt Williams has therefore come into the open and this may be an advantage. On the whole the operations themselves have not been criticised.

ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT: RECRUITMENT OF WOMEN Thank you for your letter of 8 May about the 
proposed Bill on the recruitment of women to the Ulster Defence Regiment. 
On the understanding 
that the drafting of this Bill will be a small task, as you anticipate in your letter, and that not much more than one clause will be required, the Lord President agrees to the inclusion of this Bill in this Session’s programme. 
This is 
on the basis of your assurance that you would be able to get full and firm instructions to Parliamentary Counsel tomorrow. 
The Lord 
President’s hope would be that this Bill could be taken at a meeting of the Legislation Committee next Tuesday, 22 May. 
I am sending copies of this letter to the 
recipients of yours, and also to Reid (Parliamentary Counsel’s Office).

11th May, 1973. When the Defence Secretary minuted the Prime Minister 
and his other GEN 79 colleagues on 28th November last year about his proposals to establish a Special Reconnaissance Unit (SRU) to undertake future plain clothes operations in Northern Ireland, he mentioned (in paragraph 5 of the note accompanying his minute) that soldiers who had served with the SAS within the previous three years would not be eligible to join the Unit.

the present commander of the SRU, whose tour is due to end in April, 1974. 
Defence Secretary has concluded that the importance of maintaining that rule is outweighed in this case by the importance of having the SRU under the command of a sufficiently qualified and experienced officer. 
We are now in the process of selecting a successor for Much the most suitable candidate is an 
officer who served with the SAS up to May, 1972 - and whose appointment would thus breach the three years embargo. 
The He therefore 
intends to make an exception on this occasion. The effect of doing so will be simply that, should it 
become necessary to quote the rule in order to refute allegations of SAS involvement in Northern Ireland, we should not be able to say that the three year interval had been applied invariably.

We could still say that it had been This might perhaps 
weaken the impact slightly but not, we feel, fundamentally. Lord Carrington is satisfied that the particular circumstances justify taking this fairly small risk; but he believes that his colleagues would wish to be aware of his conclusion.

May 1973 NORTHERN IRELAND FORECAST OF EVENTS - WEEKEND 11-14 MAY 1973 
OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1. 
In General, the level of activity remains similar to recent weeks but three 
soldiers and one member of the UDR have been killed during the past week. It has been a quiet week in Belfast with a significant drop in shooting incidents. In Londonderry the most significant incident was a car bomb within the City Walls on Saturday 
- the first inside the Walls since July 1972; there have, however, 
been fewer instances of hooliganism but the threat from sniper attacks continue. In the border and rural areas terrorist mine and claymore attacks continue and last Saturday three soldiers were killed by explosive devices near Crossmaglen. Rocket attacks, both in Belfast and the rural areas, continue as do bomb attacks on commercial properties, bars and garages. There have, however, been no mortar attacks during the last week. The most significant aspect of the last few days has been the increasing co-operation of the authorities of the Republic in combatting border terrorist activity.

9 May, 1973 In my letter of 4 April we put to you the revised 
Dossier on ASU activity, together with a draft message from the Prime Minister to Mr. Cosgrave. These went to Mr. Cosgrave on 13 April. I thought you would wish to have a progress report on Irish reactions. 
We are trying to assuage the worries about a leak. 
The lack of organisation may in part be remedied if we can set in motion the system we have throughout favoured namely, a series of regular meetings in each Border area between a senior Police and a senior Army officer from each side. There seems a reasonable chance that this will prove possible though we may have to approach the problem by building up from a series of ad hoc local arrangements. A fully-fledged system of consultation at all levels, established overnight by Ministerial decree, seems unlikely. 
The Minister of Defence is certainly the man in charge. 
Under Mr. Lynch this was not so; the then Minister of Defence hardly mattered, and genuine anti-IRA activity was left to Mr. O’Malley, the Minister of Justice. Mr. Donegan shows considerable zeal. For example, within days of our meeting his request for information on Russian rockets and suggesting that some of the rockets were probably on his side of the Border, the Gardai seized six rockets. This may have been coincidence, but chopping down

ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT - RECRUITMENT OF WOMEN 
You will have seen from Robert Stevens’ letter 
to Robert Andrew of 3rd May that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is content that preparations should be set in hand for a short Bill to be drafted enabling women to be recruited to the Ulster Defence Regiment. No. 10 have confirmed verbally that the Prime Minister’s concurrence may be assumed. 
We are preparing instructions for early submission 
to Parliamentary Counsel and should be grateful if you could confirm that the services of Parliamentary Counsel will be available for the necessary drafting. This will, we believe, on the strength of preliminary advice,be a small task: probably not much more than one clause to delete or amend Section I(6) of the Ulster Defence Regiment Act 1969. 
I am sending copies of this letter to Christopher 
Roberts (No. 10), Terry Platt (NIO) and Freddie Warren (Chief Whip’s Office).

There were 8 shooting incidents all involving SF. One occurred in the 
late afternoon in the Lower Falls when a patrol fired 1 round at a gunman in a derelict house when they saw a gun barrel being pushed between slates on the roof. Shortly afterwards a man was admitted to RVH with GSW to the thigh but it is not confirmed that the 2 events are connected and investigations continue. Only 40 attended a PD march in the Whiterock area which passed without incident. There were no explosions but ATO defused a 25 lb bomb in a dry cleaners shop in the Antrim Road.

LONDONDERRY 2. 
There were no shooting incidents. There were 2 explosions one of which 
was the first within the City Walls since July 1972. The device as a bomb in a milk float which had been hijacked in Sloans Terrace at 1340 hrs. At 1632 hrs the RUC received an anonymous call that there was a vehicle bomb of 120 lbs in Ferry Quay St. It was not until 1658 hrs that information was received that the milk float had been stolen (after the bombers had released the driver). The bomb exploded at 1704 hrs causing considerable damage to 5 buildings and breaking windows up to 150 m away 
- there was 1 minor civilian casualty (from 
flying glass). Between the times of the hijack and the warning the vehicle was stopped, checked and clered by 3 separate VCPs in the City Centre area and once by an RUC patrol whilst parked in Ferry Quay St. It was checked again by SF after receipt of the warning (but before information of the hijack) who could see nothing suspicious. The other bomb caused extensive damage to a bar in the Waterside. In a traffic accident involving a SF civilianised salvage vehicle and a private car the driver of the car received fatal injuries.

DEATHS OF WOII VINES 2 PARA AND CPL WILLIAMS AND TPR GIBBNS 17/21 L IN EXPLOSIONS ON 5 MAY 1973 
1. At about 0900 hours at Grid 919134 (South of Crossmaglen about 800 metres 
from the border) a bomb exploded killing: WOII VINES 2 PARA 
five other members of the patrol received minor injuries which were dealt with at the scene of the explosion; however at 1500 hours C Sgt TAYLOR 2 PARA was admitted to Musgrave Park Hospital suffering from shock and suspected cracked ribs. 
2. The incident occurred while a joint infantry - armour patrol moved South 
West on the minor road. The infantry members of the patrol dismounted to examine two piles of stones near the road. After observing them from a distance for some time WOII VINES led the patrol towards them, checking one pile at a time. As he approached the second pile the explosion occurred, killing him instantly. ATO estimated the bomb to have boon 20-30 lbs comercial explosive. 
3. During the immediate follow up to this incident a tracker dog followed a 
trail which led to the border. Local Gardai were informed and agreed to help. Two men were arrested by SF at 0915 hrs as they were leaving a farmhouse Grid 919130 (just South of the explosion). Shortly after being handed over to RUC, one of them was admitted to Daisy Hill Hospital, Newry with slight injuries sustained when he tried to resist arrest. 
4. At about 1200 hrs a further explosion occurred while ATO was checking the 
command detontion cable leading away from the site. At the point where the cable ran through a broken down gap in a wall about 150 metres from the road, two soldiers following behind ATO detonated what appears to have been a booby trap of about 10 
- 20 lbs of explosive. They were both killed. 
CPL T WILLIAMS 17/21 L TPR J GIBBONS 
17/21 L 
This was pr bably a pressure mine/release switch device. The wall had been crossed several times by other soldiers and ATO and the other command wire to the field explosion was out either side of the wall before the second explosion took placo. 
5. Later the cable was found to cross the border at Grid 924127, some 800 
metres from the first explosion. Gardai wore asked to investigate and found it ended at Grid 925126 which is presumed to have been the firing point.

Prime Minister NORTHERN IRELAND CONSTITUTION BILL 
The Bill giving effect to our policy as set out in the White Paper on Northern Ireland Constitutional Proposals is now nearly ready for Legislation Committee and I have it in mind to put it to that Committee next Friday. If that can be done and the Bill is presented and published by the following Tuesday, the Chief Whip tells me that we could have its Second Reading before Whitsun. This is very much to be desired. There are, however, two points on the Bill on which I shall be glad to have your, and my colleagues’, agreement. In both cases, the points relate to the detailed working out of principles already stated in the White Paper. 
The first concerns how statutory effect is to be given to paragraph 32 of the White Paper which envisages a form of "statutory declaration that Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom and will not cease to be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland". This raises the question how the consent of the people of Northern Ireland is to be expressed and the Bill provides that this is to be done by requiring that the holder of my Office may direct that a poll should be conducted for that purpose at intervals of not less than 10 years. This is in line with the statemen you made on 24 March 1972 about the holding of periodic polls. It is necessary to form a judgement upon the appropriate minimum interval between polls. Whatever interval is decided upon is open to criticism and there will be a good deal of debate when the Bill is before the House but I think that a provision related to intervals of not less than 10 years is about right.

Londonderry 1/1, Border -/-, Rural 3/2). There were 7 military casualties all minor. There were 5 explosions (Carrickfergus, Ardmore 2, Eglinton, Coleraine). The main attraction of the day was the appeal proceedings against the extradition of Taylor. A crowd of 100 UDA gathered outside the court in Belfast and after it was announced that the appeal had been dismissed a crowd of 350 UDA, including Paisley, gathered in the Waterside Londonderry. Apart from a small hardcore in Londonderry all dispersed peacefully. A tunnel was found at the Maze Prison. In Belfast 2 bombs were found in the GPO sorting office.
