You may remember that on October 14th last year, after leaving the At the end I 
outlined a possible deal by which the Irish Government might at some stage be (politically) bribed to look up the I.R.A. 
I have just had similar 
thoughts fed back to me from an unexpected quarter, in very much the form I put them to you. 
2. Last Wednesday (November 17th) my wife and I refused an invitation 
to dine at the Irish Embassy (poor Donal O’Sullivan says he gets a very high proportion of refusals nowadays); but the dinner was cancelled and we agreed to go round for a quiet drink. 
I had not seen his for nearly a year, and though certainly I found his views very interesting, I thought it best to ask whether he had said all this stuff to his proper contacts such as Stewart Crawford.

3. His reply, 
I have hesitated for several days before troubling you with what may for all I know be pointless reading. 
However, Colley’s renewed public 
attack on the I.R.A. (Friday’s "Telegraph") has encouraged me to do so; and even the fact that the Ambassador wants his ideas reported may be of some small and useful significance to you. 
4. In brief, the deal would be:- 
(a) some (public) light at the end of the tunnel for the Republic. This would point not so such to a unified Ireland - 
which they 
are scared to death of - but towards their entitlement to have some say in considering the future of the North. 
(b) a constitutional change in Northern Ireland by which the minority would have a fair share in the management of affairs. 
(c) the internment of the I.R.A. by the Dublin Government. 
5. Naturally I asked whether the Irish Government was in a position to deliver (c). On this the Ambassador was most emphatic.

known to be willing, and Hillery, who was in many ways an awkward customer, had specifically said to O’Sullivans "We would certainly do it - I

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 15 16 NOVEMBER 1971 
Incidents in the last 24 hours The last 24 hours have been generally quiet throughout the 
Province. The major event was the discovery at Knockanully in Co. Antrim of 54 guns of various kinds and 11,000 rounds of assorted ammunition. The find was made as a result of information obtained during normal police questioning. 2. 
Yesterday evening a crowd of local people filled in a crater 
near the border south of Clogher. A total of 25 arrests were made, including Mr. Frank McManus MP, but subsequently all but 2 persons were released. 3. 
10 wanted men were arrested yesterday.

STATEMENT BY THE HOME SECRETARY 
Attacks on police stations are a major feature of current IRA activity. 
A number of stations (including all those jointly occupied by the Army and the RUC) are at present guarded by the Regular Army or the UDR; the remainder are unprotected to the extent that their occupants are unarmed. The Army (including the UDR) will maintain its existing guards on police stations and will aim to increase the number of stations that it can protect to the extent that the operational situation and the available Regular and UDR manpower resources permit. It will also make automatic weapons available at the request of and Police Authority solely for the guarding of police stations which are at present unprotected. 
The GOC Northern Ireland as Director of Operations will provide such training in the use of these weapons as may be necessary and will agree with the Chief Constable operational orders governing their control and use. 
These arrangements will be kept under regular review.

10th November, 1971 As the Prime Minister is aware, troops serving in 
Northern Ireland are provided with a "Yellow Card" giving guidance on the circumstances, and the manner, in which they should open fire. A copy of the card in its present form is attached at Annex A. 
The terms of the Yellow Card have just been reviewed, 
in the light of recent developments and the current situation in Northern Ireland. The Defence Secretary has now approved a number of amendments to the card, which he feels that he should draw to the attention of the Prime Minister and the other members of GEN 47. He will be prepared, if the Prime Minister so wishes, to speak on the matter at this afternoon’s meeting of the Committee. 
The text of the card as it appears with the amendments 
incorporated is attached at Annex B; the new and revised passages are sidelined. Briefly the changes: 
a. 
permit Company Commanders and above, when circumstances in their opinion warrant such action, to order weapons to be cocked with a round in the breech and the safety catch at safe; 
b. 
codify the Defence Secretary’s decision of 24th September that automatic fire may be used against identified targets in the same circumstances as aimed single shots if no other weapon can be employed as effectively, though it is not to be used when persons not using firearms are in or close to the line of fire;

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 11 
10 NOVEMBER 1971 INCIDENTS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS There were a total of 9 shooting incidents and 4 bomb attacks 
during the last 24 hours. 4 of the shooting incidents and all of the bomb attacks took place in Belfast. In one of the bombing incidents troops fired at the bomb-throwers and one was seen to fall but was dragged away. 2. 
Another of the bomb attacks took place in the Woodburn House 
Hotel. The men planting the bomb gave the occupants of the hotel ample warning to vacate the building. An Army disposal team inspected the device and then, in accordance with normal practice, withdrew for a period to see whether it would go off. The bomb in fact exploded before this interval was up and work on defusing it could begin. It caused extensive damage to the hotel and nearby buildings. 3. 
in Londonderry a soldier was killed by a sniper who fired 5 
shots at a military post. In another sniping incident in Londenderry a soldier was wounded. 4. 
Following a search in the Ardoyne area of Belfast 8 men were 
arrested and a quantity of ammunition was found. 2 of the 8 men are thought to be senior members of the 3rd Battalion of the 
Provisional IRA and to be wanted for murder. If the RUC have enough evidence that will stand up in court, the 2 men will be charged with murder in the normal way. (More generally, a check has shown that very few of those who have been arrested under the Special Powers Act have been charged with criminal offences.) 5. 
In Co. Fermanagh an Army patrol was fired on by a single 
gunman from a position in the Republic and one soldier suffered a minor wound. The troops did not return the fire. 6. 
In a further incident in Co. Fermanagh a temporary Customs /Post

10th November, 1971 In connection with a civil action which is being brought 
in the Northern Ireland courts against the RUC and the Ministry of Defence, as a result of the arrests made on 9th August, we consider it necessary to claim Crown Privilege for some of the documents which would otherwise have to be disclosed in the action. Since the claim would be made for reasons of security, it needs the approval not only of the Attorney General (which is being sought concurrently by the Treasury Solicitor) but also of the Prime Minister, before the Secretary of State can sign the necessary certificate. I am afraid there is some urgency about the matter since, as I explain below, it is necessary for the Chief of Staff at Headquarters Northern Ireland to be ready, by noon tomorrow, to swear an affidavit declaring that from his own knowledge Crown Privilege will be claimed at the preliminary hearing of the action which is due to take place on 17th November. If he cannot do so, and nevertheless refuses to disclose the documents, we are advised that we shall be in contempt of court. 
The background, putting it as briefly as possible, is 
that the Northern Ireland courts have already held that there was a technical defect in the arrest procedure which was followed by the RUC and the Army when making the initial arrests on 9th August. The immediate outcome of this decision was that two of the persons arrested 
- and 
subsequently interned - were granted writs of habeas corpus; though, as you will recall, they were then re-arrested in the correct manner - as they left the court, and have remained in internment. Since that decision, all the other original arrests have either (as has happened in most cases) been overtaken by internment orders, or 
the arrested 
persons have been released. And, of course, the more recent arrests made under the Special Powers Act have been carried out in what the courts held to be the correct manner.

9th November 1971 You will know that at various times we have examined 
possible ways of actively employing Northern Ireland members of the TAVR on security duties. 
You raised this with the 
Home Secretary in September and discussed it with the CGS during his visit to Northern Ireland later that month, shortly before we announced the special arrangements under which individual members of TAVR may resign to join the UDR with reserved rights to return to the TAVR at some future date. 
So far these arrangements have had little appeal for 
members of the TAVR whose esprit de corps understandably discourages them from severing their ties with their units. We have therefore once more reviewed possible ways in which individuals or units of the TAVR in Northern Ireland might be employed. I do not think I need to go into great detail, but I felt I should let you know that despite the most careful consideration we have found no acceptable way of involving the TAVR as such in security operations at the present time. The main factors which have led us to this conclusion are that the TAVR is essentially a reserve for the British Army as a whole, and its role and purpose is geared to increasing the Army order of battle on a full time basis. 
The UDR, on the 
other hand, is a local volunteer force specifically created by Parliament for security duties in Northern Ireland under legislation which allows its members to undertake operational duties either on a part time basis (at night or weekends) or on a full time basis for emergency periods. The two forces have thus distinctly different roles and terms of service. 
Nevertheless, we recognise that in Northern Ireland many 
members of TAVR are most anxious to serve actively at the present time. Accordingly we are proposing to lay emphasis on the possibility that members of a TAVR formation who decide to resign and join the UDR may continue to serve together in one of the new UDR sub-units being formed as part of the current expansion. In this way we would hope to meet, in large measure, the esprit de corps argument mentioned above. 
The Rt. Hon. Brian Faulkner, M.P.

NORTHERN ICELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 10 9 NOVEMBER 1971 INCIDENTS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS There were 3 shooting and 2 bomb attacks in Belfast during the 
last 24 hours, and in one of the shooting incidents a NCO received minor wounds. 2. 
A search which was begun during the night is still going on 
in the Andersonstown area of Belfast. It is being conducted selectively on the basis of information from the Special Branch. So far one machine-gun, 11 other guns and 900 rounds of assorted ammunition have been found. 34 people have been arrested, though it is not thought likely that many of them will be on the wanted list. 3. 
There were two cases yesterday of cratering parties being 
fired on by gunmen within the Republic. Both incidents took place in Co. Fermanagh. There were no casualties. The Border 4. 
The main subject for discussion when CGS visits Northern 
Ireland tomorrow will be the various issues concerning the border, including cratering. Release of Arrested Persons 5. 
Renewed efforts will be made to convey in our. 
publicity the fact that the eventual release of a large number of those arrested does not mean a high failure rate in our attempts to catch the people on the wanted list but that what often happens is that during raids by the security forces not only are wanted men arrested but their companions are also taken into temporary custody. The point will also be made, as was implied by Mr. Faulkner on Panorama last night, that a certain amount of useful information is obtained by questioning those who are subsequently released.

duty and wearing civilian clothes were shot by 2 gunmen as they were walking back to camp. One soldier was killed and the other injured. (The rules for walking out vary from district to district in Northern Ireland. In Belfast, for example, soldiers are not permitted to walk out at all. In Lisburn they are allowed to walk out in groups of at least 4 during daylight. In Lurgan they may walk out in pairs in daylight.) 3. 
Earlier in the weekend a RCT Major was shot and seriously 
injured in Belfast in what appears to have been an attempt to kidnap him. 4. 
Some 20 to 30 rounds were fired from across the border at an 
Army patrol which went to investigate the blowing up of the Customs post at Rosslea. There were no casualties, and a subsequent search by-RUC and.Gardai on their respective sides of the border revealed nothing 5. 
A search at a quarry at Carrickmore, Co. Tryone, led to the 
discovery of a machine-gun, a shot-gun, a number of rounds of assorted ammunition, and a large quantity of explosive, detonators and fuses. Incident in Londonderry 6. 
HQ Northern Ireland issued on Saturday evening a statement 
about the incident in Londonderry in which a middle-aged woman was blinded by a rubber bullet. The statement said that there had been no intention to injure the woman and expressed regret at what had happened.

PRIME MINISTER Malta Round Table Conference 1955 I thought you might like to glance at the Report 
of the Malta Round Table Conference of 1955, to refres your memory about how that was organised. As you recalled, the Lord Chancellor of the day was the Chairman. There were 16 members - 8 from the 
Government side (comprising a Peer and 7 fairly senior Backbenchers); 7 Labour members nominated by them (including the Leader of the Opposition and appropriate members of the Shadow Cabinet) and one Liberal, who was in fact the Liberal Leader. The Maltese interests concerned, both Government 
and Opposition, were not included in the Conference but gave evidence t it, as also did the Colonial Secretary, and Junior Ministers at the Treasury and the Admiralty. The timetable was as follows:6 July 
- announcement of the Conference 28 July 
- composition and terms of reference announced 
19 September - opening meeting 
12 plenary sessions held at Lancaster House between 21 and 30 September 
Closed sessions in London, mainly in the first half of October 
16 to 23 October visit to Malta (including 3 plenary sessions at the Palace, Valletta) 
Private sittings to discuss recommendations, mainly in November 
9 December - Report presented. November 1971

PRIME MINISTER You asked me to consider the main implications of appointing a 
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. There are several aspects of this question on which I should need 
to take advice if we were to be certain of our ground. For the moment I have not done so; but you may like to have over the weekend the following preliminary thoughts, which I can take further, if you wish, by very limited consultation on Monday. There are two main questions, which can be summarised as the status 
of the new Minister and his functions. As regards status, there is no room at present for a new Secretary of 
State (at least in terms of authority to pay a salary); and we should have to find a way round this. 
But, on the assumption that we did so, the new 
Secretary of State would presumably have to be a member of the Cabinet (with reasonable seniority); and he would also have to be responsible in the normal way to the House of Commons in terms of Parliamentary Questions, debates, etc. He would presumably have to spend a certain amount of time at Stormont; but, if he was to be an effective member of the Cabinet and to discharge his responsibility to Parliament but was not to be inflicted with an intolerable burden of travel, he might need to be supported by a junior Minister, who would have to be prepared to spend practically the whole of his time at Stormont. For the rest, the Secretary of State would resemble the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales in the sense of having to conduct his relations with other Departments on the normal basis of collective responsibility; and his dealings with e. g. the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Defence and other Ministers would be essentially the same as those of the Home Secretary at present. None of those Ministers would - or should - suffer any diminution in his own powers and responsibilities In short, there would be no basic change - with the very important exception that a fresh mind would be brought to bear on the problem and would be able to give it undivided attention. All the above, however, assumes that the apparatus at Stormont 
would remain as at present and that, in terms of functions, the new Secretary of State would 
for our relationship with Northern Ireland. 
over the Home Secretary’s general responsibility I do not think- but should like to 
check this - that the Home Secretary has any statutory functions in relation to Northern Ireland; and there should therefore be no need for amending

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 8 5 NOVEMBER 1971 
INCIDENTS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS It was a relatively quiet period throughout the Province 
with one bomb explosion and seven shooting incidents. A bomb exploded in the Regency Hotel in Belfast and a second device in the York Hotel in Belfast took ten hours to be defused. 2. 
A search was carried out in the Andersonstown area of Belfast 
between 6 a.m. and 11 a.m. As a result of this search 15 people were detained and a quantity of medical supplies, stick grenades and one shotgun were found. A statement will be issued as soon as possible about the incident in which a woman was hit in the face by 
a rubber bullet during the search. (Consideration is also being given to taking up with "The Times" their repetition in their report on the Andersonstown search of the IRA story of some weeks ago that 
a rubber bullet had been fired into a church while Mass was being said. The Army’s investigation of this incident had led to a statement being issued at the time which showed that the IRA version bore little relation to the facts.) 3. 
In the Ardoyne area of Belfast an IRA (PROVISIONAL) unit 
commander was arrested. 4. 
A military cratering party 325 metres within Northern Ireland 
in the Keady area in Co Armagh were fired on by gunmen. There were no casualties. 5. 
A Scots Guards soldier injured in Belfast on 14 September 
died in Glasgow of his injuries. He was the 34th regular soldier to be killed. Arrests 6. 
Since 9 August there have been 876 arrests under the Special

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 7 4 NOVEMBER 1971 
Incidents in the last 24 hours There have been two major bomb explosions in he last 24 hours. 
The first occurred in the Black Mountain public house west of Belfast. there were no casualties. The second damaged the Carlton Hotel at Belleek, Co Fermanagh, again without casualties. 2. 
In an exchange of shots in the Unity Flats in Belfast the Army 
shot a gunman who died on the way to hospital. Three RUC and one soldier were wounded. 3. 
As a result of a tip-off a search was conducted in the Falls 
Road area of Belfast and 5,000 rounds of ammunition, one machine-gun, one light machine-gun, three rifles and two pistols were found. 4. 
Seventeen men on the wanted list were arrested yesterday in 
Londonderry. (Consideration is being given to the possibility of making clear, when arrests of this kind are made in future, that they are wanted arrests. This would help convey to the public the fact that there is a steady stream of arrests of known IRA adherents.) Weekly figures of incidents 5. 
The figures of incidents in the week ending midnight Tuesday 
2 November are generally very similar to those for the previous week. The only noteworthy difference is that the number of wanted arrests way 41 compared with 73 for the previous week. The number of routine arrests was slightly up. IRA order of battle 6. 
The original JIC assessment was that the IRA’s order of battle 
consisted of about 2000 hard core militants, who were backed by a relatively untrained "reserve" of sympathisers several times that number who could be called out if necessary. HQ Northern Ireland have recently produced a new IRA order of battle which shows a slight reduction in the number of activists. This reflects the growing number of IRA casualties, but what is not known is the extent to which this reduction is offset by IRA recruitment.

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland It might be convenient to begin the meeting tomorrow by discussing 
proposals for dealing with the economic situation. The Secretary of State for Defence is anxious to be present when the Compton Report is discussed; but he cannot arrive before 5. 30 pm. (Lord Balniel will be there from 5. 00 pm. ) So the agenda might be as follows:1. 
Economic Situation The Chancellor’s proposals are set out in the Treasury letter of 
1st November; but I believe that he would like to enlarge on it. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has been invited. One question which will arise is whether we can proceed on the lines proposed in the Treasury letter without considering the effect of special measures in Northern Ireland on Scotland, Wales and the English regions. 
It is 
arguable that, in view of the emergency character of these measures, we can ignore their "repercussive" impact elsewhere in the United Kingdom. But the Secretaries of State for Scotland, the Environment and Wales should be informed of the emergency measures and given an opportunity to comment; and, when we come to consider longer term policies for Northern Ireland, we shall certainly have to consider them in a United Kingdom context. 2. 
Items arising from the last Meeting 
(a) The bombing threat. The Ministry of Defence will be able to report on preventive measures at military depots etc. As regards Government buildings I attach a note prepared by the CSD after a preliminary interdepartmental discussion. The conclusions in paragraphs 5-7 probably carry matters as far as it is profitable to carry them at this juncture. As regards the protection of Downing Street, Sir Philip Allen will be able to report the outcome of the discussion between the Home Office and Scotland Yard. 
(b) Putting internees on Trial. The Attorney General has been consulted; and the Home Secretary will be able to report. 
(c) The Border. The study of further measures of Border control will probably not be ready for discussion tomorrow. 
(d) Police Reserve. As you will have seen, Mr. Faulkner has acceded to the request from the Police Authority for the arming of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve. The Home Secretary hopes that at least 2 of the Roman Catholic members of the Authority will nevertheless continue to serve.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 6 
3 NOVEMBER 1971 Incidents in the last 24 hours There have been a total of six shooting and five tomb incidents, 
two border incidents and one ambush in the last 24 hours. Most of them took place in Belfast. 2. 
The major incident was the blowing up of a public house and a 
shop on either side of a police station in south Belfast. Two civilians 
- a man and a woman - were killed and 36 injured. One 
terrorist was caught and is in custody in hospital. (It has been decided to keep the case of this terrorist under review as it goes through the various stages of the judicial process, as an example of how the law deals with terrorists which it might be possible to use publicly at an appropriate time.) 3. 
The ambush occurred in the Ardoyne area of Belfast when a 
foot patrol of the Green Howards disturbed a trip wire which set of a Claymore mine filled with nails. Seven soldiers were injured. 4. 
The first border incident occurred when a Garda car drove a 
few hundred yards into Northern Ireland. The occupants inspected the road and then drove back across the border. The second border incident was an incursion by an Irish helicopter. 5. 
The Departments concerned are considering urgently whether 
these two border incursions should be taken up immediately with the Irish Government. RUC 6.

Prime Ministers Personal Minute No.64/71 
Cratering of Roads When we agreed on 7 October to embark on a 
programme of cratering unapproved roads on the. Northern Ireland/Irish Republic border, I asked that care should be taKen to minimise inconvenience to local people, even if this meant cratering certain roads some ay back from the border. 
Reports or 
certain incidents have suggested that this proviso may sometimes have been overlooked, and that the cratering or bridge blowing has too often been done as close as possible to where we believe the border to be, with little regard to local circumstances. There have also been far too many disputes with the Garda about the location of the border and some at least of these could perhaps have been avoided by a more flexible approach to cratering. 
I realise 
that some of our difficulties may be eased when we get better maps. 
I also understand that an instruction 
has now been issued that no cratering is to take place within 300 metres of the border, and this should lessen the number of incidents. 
The cratering operation is however undoubtedly costing us something

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 2 NOVEMBER 1971 
Incidents in the last 24 hours The main incident in the last 24 hours was the killing of two 
CID detectives by gunmen in the Andersonstown area of Belfast. Border incidents 2. 
Investigation by HQ Northern Ireland has shown that the accounts 
put out both by the Irish authorities and by press and television of recent border "confrontations" have made them sound much more dramatic and hostile than they really were. In fact all exchanges between patrols of the British Army and of the Garda have been amicable, though it is true that because of the frequency with which they have been fired upon from across the border, some members of the British patrols are usually in firing positions during the exchanges. 3. 
However, to prevent a repetition of these incidents HQ Northern 
Ireland has issued further orders that no British soldier is to go within fifty metres of the border and that no craters are to be made within 300 metres of the border. Cratering of roads 4. 
Half of the 150 unapproved roads which it is planned to make 
impassable have been cratered. HQ Northern Ireland are considering whether different methods of cratering might make it more difficult for the local inhabitants to fill up the holes. Public Relations 5. 
A typical incident in the PR war took place at the week-end 
when the Scots Guards were accused of barricading people in a dance hall. In fact men of the Scots Guards were in the vicinity of the dance hall to deal with a quite different incident in the area and in this connection some of them had climbed on to the roof of the hall. In the meantime some of those in the dance hall had seen the Scots

2nd November, 1971 Ref. A0675 If I may be permitted to add a postscript 
to Alan Simcock’s letter of yesterday requesting that for all future small meetings of Ministers and officials about Northern Ireland those concerned should come through the Cabinet Office communicating door into No. 10, it is to ask that the cars at any rate of officials and the Chiefs of Staff should not as a consequence be parked for any significant period outside the Cabinet Office front door, thus frustrating the whole purpose of the exercise.

The Rt Hon Edward Heath MBE MP 10 Downing Street LONDON SW1 
1 November 1971 
As a follow-up to my letter of 14 October I thought I should put on record the steps I have taken on the various points raised in the correspondence and earlier discussions, although you have of course been made aware of them through our telephone conversations over the past week. 
The Green Paper was published on Tuesday, 26 October and on the same day the appointment of Basil McIvor as Minister of Community 
Relations was announced. He is a middle of the road - indeed liberal - Unionist who represents a mixed constituency fairly evenly divided between Protestants and Catholics and will, I believe, do the 
job very well. It had been my intention to fill this particular vacancy with someone from outside the Unionist Party and I did in fact offer the appointment to Senator Norman Kennedy, a member of the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the Irish Secretary of the Transport and General 
Workers’ Union. He was personally very willing 
to accept but after consultation with Trade Union circles in London felt obliged to decline on the ground, as I understand it, that his presence in the Government might be seen as identifying the Trade Union Movement with the Government point of view. 
el 
I then canvassed the possibility of appointing Mrs Edith Taggart, a Unionist Member of the Senate who had previously been active in the affairs of the Northern Ireland Housing Trust. She, however, was unable for personal reasons to accept. 
On Wednesday, 27 October the appointment of Dr G B Newe as Minister of State in the Department of the Prime Minister was announced. I had intended to make this appointment at the same time as Basil McIvor’s but Dr Newe, whom I had approached the previous Friday, was unable to give me his answer in time. This appointment is,as you realise, a radical new departure since Dr Newe is a Roman Catholic; he is much respected by responsible Catholics and is in good standing with his Church authorities. 
I see his role primarily as representing the minority viewpoint at the Cabinet table and as he will have no Departmental responsibilities he will be able, I hope, to move about the country a good deal taking the pulse of Catholic opinion in all walks of life. He will also maintain a close relationship with the Minister of Community Relations. As he is not a member of either House of Parliament his

THE NAMES AND OCCUPATIONS OF THOSE PRESENT ARE APPENDED: IT IS BELIEVED THAT THEY REPRESENT A REASONABLY REPRESENTATIVE CROSS-SECTION OF MODERATE OPINION ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. 
THOSE PRESENT WERE UNANIMOUS IN THEIR ASSESSMENT OF CERTAIN 
IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE PRESENT SITUATION. IT WAS AGREED THAT IT MIGHT BE OF VALUE TO TRANSMIT THESE UNANIMOUS VIEWS TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT INFORMALLY, AND THE POLITICAL MEMBERS OF THE GROUP FROM THE REPUBLIC WERE ASKED TO ARRANGE FOR THIS TO BE DONE. IN SO ACTING THEY ARE, OF COURSE, REPRESENTING ONLY THEMSELVES AND OTHERS WHO ATTENDED THIS MEETING: THEY ARE NOT ACTING ON BEHALF OF OR AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES TO WHICH THEY BELONG. 
THOSE FROM NORTHERN IRELAND WERE UNANIMOUS IN EXPRESSING THE VIEW 
THAT THE BREATHING-SPACE ORIGINALLY AFFORDED BY THE INTERVENTION OF THE BRITISH ARMY, DURING WHICH A POLITICAL SOLUTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOUND, HAS LONG SINCE ENDED. IN THE SITUATION THAT HAS EXISTED FOR SOME TIME PAST THE ARMY HAS ABANDONED ANY ATTEMPT TO MAKE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE IRA AND THE ROMAN CATHOLIC POPULATION IN THE GHETTO AREAS. THE RESULTANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC POPULATION AND THE ARMY IN THESE AREAS IS NOW SUCH THAT SUPPORT FOR THE IRA IN THESE AREAS IS NOW ALMOST UNIVERSAL AND NON-VIOLENT LEADERS HAVE LOST ALL SUPPORT.

4. IN SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION , THE IRISH. POLITICIANS MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS: 1. THE APPOINTMENT OF DR NEWE, WHILE IT WAS INTERESTING AND COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT TWO YEARS AGO, WAS OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE. HE WAS A DO-GOODER WHO COULD REPRESENT NOBODY BUT HIMSELF. II. MR FAULKNER, BY STATING THREE TIME IN PUBLIC THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO NON-UNIONISTS IN HIS GOVERNMENT, SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO SABOTAGE MR MAUDLING’S TALKS BEFORE THEY BEGAN. THEY THOUGHT IT ESSENTIAL TO CLEAR UP AN AMBIGUITY THEY SAW IN MR MAUDLING’S POSITION: WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE PROVISION OF AN ACTIVE, PERMANENT AND GUARANTEED ROLE FOR THE MINORITY AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ADMINISTRATION, WAS IT IN THE KNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPTANCE OF MR FAULKNER’S PROVISO? WERE THE MINORITY BEING OFFERED SUCH A ROLE AT EVERY LEVEL EXCEPT THAT OF GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERED IN THE PRESENT DISASTROUS SITUATION? Ill. SINCE THE RECENT SDLP MEETING GERRY FITT HAD EMERGED MORE CLEARLY AS THE REAL LEADER OF A MUCH MORE COMPACT AND UNITED GROUP. HE WAS THE ONE MOST LIKELY TO HELP IN THE MAUDLING TALKS AND AS HE WOULD BE FREQUENTLY IN WESTMINSTER THEY RECOMMENDED THAT MINISTER SHOULD KEEP IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH HIM. IV. EVENTS IN THE NORTH SINCE THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST HAD GIVEN AN IMPETUS TO BOTH SINN FEIN/IRA FACTIONS WHICH WAS HORRIFING IN ITS IMPLICATIONS. THE IRA WAS GROWING DAILY IN STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE AND IN THE SYMPATHY IT ATTRACTED. INTIMIDATION WAS WIDESPREAD. THE DAIL DEBATE ON NORTHERN IRELAND ON 20 AND 21 OCTOBER COULD NOT HAVE CONTINUED LONGER THAN IT DID BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF TDS WHO HAD BEEN TREATENED IF THEY SPOKE AGAINST VIOLENCE. (TO MY ASTONISHMENT, THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY THE REPRESENTATIVES PRESENT FROM ALL THREE PARTIES).

MY TELS NOS 521 AND 531:MR. LYNCH’S ATTITUDE TO FURTHER TALKS IN LONDON. 
1. MCCANN, DURING AN INFORMAL CONVERSATION HAS JUST TOLD ME THAT TO HIS CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE THE TAOISEACH FEELS HE CANNOT GO TO LONDON IN THE PRESENT SITUATION, FOR THREE REASONS:(1) THE RESULTS OF THE CHEQUERS MEETINGS HAVE BEEN FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW, ALMOST ENTIRELY NEGATIVE (11) EVEN IF HE FELT HE SHOULD GO HIS CABINET AND PARTY WOULD NOT LET HIM (111)HE MAY HAVE A POLITICAL CRISIS ON HIS HANDS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
2. ON POINT (111) SEE MYTELS 543 AND 544. THE THREE PROBLEMS ARE IN FACT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE MAIN POLITICAL ISSUE OF MR. LYNCH’S ty LEADERSHIP AND HIS ’’PEACEFUL APPROACH’’. UNTIL HIS POLITICAL SURVIVAL IS ASSURED IT WOULD BE BOTH REALISTIC AND TACTFUL NOT TO PROPOSE A DATE FOR HIS VISIT. IF YOU AGREE, PERHAPS I MIGHT CONVEY A MESSAGE TO THE EFFECT THAT WE QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT HIS MANY PREOCCUPATIONS COULD MAKE IT HARD FOR HIM TO LEAVE DUBLIN AT PRESENT, AND THAT WHILE HE WILL BE WELCOME AT ANY TIME WE DO NOT WANT TO ADD TO HIS DIFFICULTIES BY PROPOSING A DEFINITE DATE AT THIS STAGE. 
3. IF THERE IS ANYTHING NEW TO PROPOSE OR OFFER HIM WHICH WOULD 
HAVE A BEARING ON HIS CHANCES OF SURVIVAL, THE SITUATION WOULD BE DIFFERENT, AT PRESENT I WOULD STILL RATE THEM FAIRLY HIGH.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 41 NOVEMBER 1971 Incidents at the week-end 1. 
The number of incidents at the week-end was not out of the 
ordinary. The main ones were the blowing up of eight Customs house on Saturday and of two temporary Customs caravans on Sunday. Morale amongst Customs Officers in Northern Ireland is low as a result of these incidents and there is talk amongst them of. providing only temporary customs facilities. 2. 
The number of arrests is still satisfactory, though the figures 
which are due on Wednesday of this week may show a slight fall. Bombing incidents 3. 
There is concern in HQ Northern Ireland at the increasing 
number of bomb incidents and more particularly at the fact that the bombs are becoming increasingly more powerful and are being laid with greater expertise. The bomb which killed a Scots Guards cook at the week-end could have killed the whole platoon had they been in their billet. Approved roads study 4. 
HQ Northern Ireland have completed their study of the possibility 
of closing a number of approved roads at the border and they are sending their report to the Ministry of Defence. A point in favour of reducing the number of official crossing points is that there will be fewer Customs posts which the IRA might attack. Explosions in London 5. 
There is no evidence yet as to who was responsible for the 
two bomb explosions in London during the week-end. Introduction of direct rule 6. 
An on-the-record denial has been issued of the Rev Ian Paisley’s 
statement at the week-end that direct rule would be introduced in two days’ time.

1 November 1971 Northern Ireland Demarkation Republic Border: Disputes The Prime Minister saw in paragraph 4 of the "in due course to the 
current situation report No. 3 on Northern Ireland dated 29 October the suggestion that consideration would need to be given 
"Immediate action is required where 
there is doubt if it prevents us blowing up the roads. 
E.H." You will no doubt wish to discuss with the 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office how best to pursue this.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 25 30 
153/44/47 NOVEMBER 1971 
Incidents in the last 24 hours The period was comparatively quiet throughout the Province. There were 4 shooting incidents - in one of which a soldier was injured in Belfast - and 4 
explosions. The explosions included a bomb attack on the Customs post at Aghalane (Co. Fermanagh) - which, having been bombed 3 times in the past year, was a temporary structure - the raiders arriving in a Northern Ireland bus which they had highjacked in the Republic. There were 7 armed robberies during the period. 2. A young civilian was found shot dead near Crossmaglen; this had the appearance of an IRA execution, but the facts are still being established. There were 16 arrests of wanted men during the period. Composition of the wanted list 3. There are in fact a number of lists. The RUC maintain 3 lists centrally: i) 
The "criminal charges" list. this shows all those in respect of whom the police hold sufficient evidence to be able to charge them with a specific crime if and when they are arrested. The crime may or may not be an offence against security, i.e. may or may not have anything to do with the IRA. 
ii) The "arrest list": this shows those persons who are believed to be in a position to "help the police with their enquiries" into security offences, but on whom there is not yet sufficient evidence to frame a charge. People on this list are supposed not to be aware that they are wanted. The current size of this list is about 600. 
iii) The "wanted list": this comprises persons who have already been on the arrest list but who have become aware, for instance because their homes have been searched, that they are wanted. The current size of this list is rather under 200. 
4. There are in addition wanted lists maintained locally at Brigade level, compiled from information gleaned from within the Brigade area. There are of course

NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL STATISTICS You asked Robert Andrew on Friday 
if we could provide an up-to-date statement of operational statistics in Northern Ireland for the Prime Minister’s use in the Debate this afternoon. 
I attach a note. As you will see, 
most of these figures have been published fairly recently in Answers, but they are all brought up-to-date to this morning where possible. I am sorry the list is a little messy but given the need for speed we have not waited to have it made more presentable.

Northern Ireland. It must be the to see an end of the terrorism and to see a situation achieved where ommunities can play their rightful part in restoring life and ic development in the whole province. This is a problem of 
both c eco

Ireland can be torn out of the United Kingdom against the vaan of majority of her people. People in Great Britain say asthis i

INTERNMENT PROCEDURES At the meeting last Monday (GEN 47(71)8th Meeting), the Prime Minister 
asked us to look yet again at the possibility of devising a system under which the bulk of internees could be brought to trial. As you know, I have noW had a talk with the Attorney General on this matter and with Mr Dalton who is a member the Judge Brown’s Advisory. Committee and a former Kenyan judge. There are two difficulties 
- and the Attorney General and Mr Dalton both 
think that they are insuperable. First, the reason for interment is simply that while a good 
deal is known about active IRA members, the evidence, such as it is, 
would not inimost cases stand up in court. Examples are attached of the kind of information which is known about individuals. Much of it is simply not up to the standards of evidence required in the courts. Secondly, even if the evidence did stand up, there are obvious and overriding objections to disclosing its nature to the defence or arranging for a confrontation between the security services and the person involved

Northern Ireland - Possible Courses of Action (GEN 47(71) 5) 
You may wish to begin tomorrow’s meeting with a brief review of 
the current situation and such discussion of specific outstanding problems as is necessary.

It is some time since Ministers considered, even privately, the fundamental political issues; and on Monday they will be expected to give at least some indication of a political objective. 
involving the South and one confined to the North. 
The long-term choice remains the choice between a solution I doubt whether 
Ministers will judge that the time has yet come when we can make any overt move in the direction of involving Dublin in the future of Ulster. But Mr. Lynch’s recent speech at Monaghan (I attach the relevant extract from the Irish Times) is significant in so far as, despite recent disappointments and misunderstandings, it still leaves the door open to an eventual reconcilation between the North and the South by peaceful means; and it seems to me important that whatever may be said in Monday’s debate should at least not close that door. Sooner or later we shall have to deal with Mr. Lynch again; and Ministers may feel that if this could be indicated to him (even if more privately than in open Parliamentary debate) no harm would be done. Mr. Wilson’s speech suggests that the Opposition are beginning to feel their way towards an approach involving Dublin; and even though this may well reflect what Mr. Lynch will have said to Mr. Wilson during their recent meeting it is surely consistent also with the realities of the situation. Ministers may well feel, however, that, for the public purposes of 
Monday’s debate, we cannot yet afford to move beyond our existing position based on the integrity of the Border and of the 1949 pledge. In short, we must continue to play the hand on the basis of the present constitutional position. Even on this hypothesis, however, there is a choice - 
to play 
the hand in partnership with Mr. Faulkner or to adopt a course which would risk his disappearing and our having to find something else to put in his

shooting incidents and three explosions. 2. 
There were 32 wanted arrests made yesterday, 29 of which were 
in Belfast and three in Londonderry. There were no routine arrests. Drop in IRA activity 3. 
result of 
It is thought that the continuing lull in IRA activity is the pressure which the security forces are exe 
on them rather than a pause before the introduction of some new tactic such as kidnapping or assassination. There probably a link between the reduction in IRA activity and the speculation in Northern Ireland and the Republic about the possibility of a truce. It is not clear whether the IRA’s definition of a truce would be confined only to the suspension of shooting or whether they would also want it to include a halt to arrests and searches. So far the Government has not responded officially to the rumours about a truce but the lobby has been told that even if the IRA do stop shooting, arrests of wanted people and searches for arms and ammunition by the security forces would have to continue. However, the question of a truce may come up in the forthcoming 
debate on Northern Ireland and arrangements are being made to bring with 
Ministers to deal with it and/the more general question of the effect which the present lull may have on possible political initiative s. Army Public Relations 4.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 2023 NOVEMBER 1971 Incidents in the last 24 Hours The last 24 hours have been generally quiet with a total of 
7 shooting incidents and 2 major explosions. One of the bomb incidents occurred in a public house in Lurgan: one man was killed and some 10 injured. 2. 
A total of 10 wanted and 5 routine arrests were made in the 
last 24 hours. Border incidents 3. 
In response to representations made by HM Embassy in Dublin 
on 18 November about recent border incidents, an official of the Irish Ministry for External Affairs said that while the points put to him would be considered, the fact was that the Irish authorities did not have enough troops and police to control the border effectively. The FCO are now considering raising the matter again with the Irish Government but at a higher level. A further approach would be based on the general line that it is not acceptable that a government cannot prevent attacks on a neighbouring territory being mounted inside its own borders. It will also be possible to support fresh representations with information which is now available pinpointing the areas in the Republic in which the IRA Active Service Units are based. Allegations of brutality 4. 
The allegations now being made by a Mr Docherty about his 
treatment by the police and the army and reported in Private Eye and the Irish newspapers underline the need for the RUC to give arrested

A search of Portglenone Monastery by 45 RM Commando and the RUC led to the discovery of some signal equipment.

In one of the border incidents a patrol escorting a party of

of the men who escaped from Crumlin Road jail. The men were dressed in priests’ clothing and they were accompanied by two real priests. All 4 are helping the police with their enquiries. 5. 
The involvement of the 2 priests, together with certain 
information which suggests that a monastery may have been used during the escape of the prisoners, may lead to difficulties with the Roman Catholic hierarchy. The Home Office are obtaining the advice of the UK Representative on how the incident should be handled. In the meantime 45 RM Commando are carrying out a cordon and search operation for the other escaped men. 6. 
Shots from the Republic were fired at a patrol of 42 RM Commando 
near Keady. The fire was returned and .1 gunman was seen to fall and another was possibly hit. The Gardai later took 4 men away from the area. The RM patrol suffered no casualties. Arrests in Hackney 7.

THE COMPTON REPORT 
This is just to confirm the two points I put to you on the telephone after lunch today. 2. 
about the wording of paragraph 53 of the report about the information the committee could not publish because it is classified secret. He feels that this paragraph is really most misleading. You will remember that I raised this point in my letter to you of 22 October and I gather you spoke to Compton at the time about it. We agreed I think that you would try and have another word with Compton about the wording of this paragraph. Meanwhile I am having a note prepared here of tne information given to Compton which we have asked him rot to publish. In most, if not all, the cases quoted to me orally it seems to me clear that the need for secrecy is unchallengable,eg the location of the interrogation centre, details of the information obtained as a result of interrogation, similar experiences in Cyprus and Aden and so on. It seems to me that Compton should be warned that if he leaves the paragraph as it is Ministers may have to state publicly the information given to them on a secret basis and why it could not be published. It does not seem to me that this would do him or his colleagues a great deal of good. 
The first is that my Secretary of State is still very bothered 3. Secondly with reference to the covering note from Morris drawing 
attention to the photographs referred to in para 55, we would like to place on record the point that if there was any question of having the photographs published we would want the images of the handlers to be erased. 
4. Apart from these two points we have no further security objections 
to raise. I am sending a copy of this letter to Burke Trend. and to Dick White.

November 1971 I am writing to let you know that my colleagues and I have felt 
it right to authorise the submission to the Compton Inquiry of a note about the interrogation of detainees. I enclose a copy of the note (marked ’A’). 
The Committee saw representatives of the Ministry of Defence and 
asked questions on the note. I understand that the Committee’s report is likely to set out these paragraphs and then to say that the Committee has taken evidence from officials about the application of the general rules set out in the Government memorandum. The report will then summarise this evidence as in the document ’B’. 
its report, not to ascribe responsibility to any particular section of the security forces; but the publication of this evidence should help to give an accurate impression of the concern of the United Kingdom 
I understand that the Committee will in any event be careful, in 
Government with the rules which were applied. I should be grateful if you could treat this letter and accompanying 
documents as being sent for your own personal information, except that I would see no objection to your showing them to the Attorney General.

NOTE ON INTERROGATION 1. The general rules governing the custody of detainees and the processes of 
interrogation have been reviewed from time to time by the Government Departments and agencies concerned in the light of experience gained in the various internal security operations in which HMG have been involved since the last war. The techniques of interrogation currently in use have also been employed in many previous internal security situations. The latest instructions on the rules to be followed were issued in 1965, and were revised in 1967 to provide for the daily inspection by a medical officer in the light of the recommendations in the Report on the Aden situation by Mr Roderic Bowen QC issued in November 1966 (Cmd,3165). 
2. 
These general rules include the following safeguards: a. 
b. c. Subjects to be seen daily by Medical Officer, 
The following are prohibited: (i) violence to life and person, in particular, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; 
(ii) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment. 
d. Subjects are to be treated humanely but with strict discipline. 
(These rules follow the broad principles for the treatment of persons under arrest or detention during civil disturbances as laid down in Article 3 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (1949).) 
3. The precise application of these general rules in particular circumstances 
is inevitably to some extent a matter of judgment on the part of those immediately responsible for the operations in question. Intelligence is the key to successful operations against terrorists; and the key to intelligence is information regarding 
Medical examination nd record of weight of subject on admission and discharge.

1. The objectives mentioned in the memorandum may involve the use of the 
following methods, the circumstances and duration of whose application may vary according to the staff and accommodation available at the interrogation centre and the length of time for which detainees may be left alone or must be kept together:a. 
Wall Standing Requiring detainees to stand with their arms against a wall but not in a position of stress provides security for detainees and guards against physical violence during the reception and search period and whenever detainees are together outside their own rooms in a holding room awaiting interrogation. It also assists the interrogation process by imposing discipline. Although the security need for this technique could be reduced by an increase of staff sufficient to provide for the separate custody of each individual while in transit between his own room and the interrogation room, there would be increased risks of physical violence or of a need for physical contact between detainees and guards. 
b. 
Hooding The hood (a black pillow-slip which the detainee is not required to wear while he is being interrogated or while he is alone in his room) reduces to the minimum the possibility that while he is in transit or with other detainees he will be identified or will be able to identify other persons or the locations to which he is moved. It thus provides security both for the detainee and for his guards. It can also, in the case of some detainees, increase their sense of isolation and so be helpful to the interrogator thereafter. 
C. 
Noise The continuous noise to which detainees may be subjected prevents their

1. A few days ago I asked Mr Whitmore to prepare a note about 
the kind of action that might be taken after the publication of the Compton Committee Report to establish whether the process of interrogation which the Compton Committee consider involved physical ill-treatment was, in all the circumstances, justified. A copy of the note which Mr Whitmore has prepared has now reached me via AUS(GS) and is attached. 
2. Since this note was prepared there have been further 
developments and I gather from Mr Maitland that the Prime Minister is now considering what would be the best course. The alternatives seem to be:- 
a. A body with a judge in the chair and two Privy 
Councillors (the judge might be either Lord Parker or Lord Diplock, the latter being the Chairman of the Security Commission). 
b. 3. A body without Privy Councillors but again with a judge in the chair. No doubt there will be a further discussion of all this 
at the Prime Minister’s meeting tomorrow afternoon. 3 Nov 71

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland - Techniques Interrogation Immediately after the end of the Debate, Denis 
Healey telephoned a statement to the press on interrogation techniques. Guardian (cutting attached). 
This is reproduced in the At this morning’s 
meeting under Sir James Dunnett, it was agreed that Mr. Healey’s allegation must be answered as soon as possible. he Ministry of Defence will not be first for Questions until shortly before Christmas. 
You have two Questions on Neither 
the Defence Secretary nor Lord Balniel has an immediate speaking engagement. 
Northern Ireland for answer today and we could put up a back bencher to ask you about Healey. 
The trouble 
is that you might have to admit that you personally did not know about the techniques. 
George Cunningham 
has put down a Question to you for answer on Thursday, in which he ask whether you knew about these techniques. We are trying to get this transferred to the Ministry of Defence. In these circumstances, I think it might be best 
for Lord Balniel to answer Healey on the "World At One" today. 
Healey could not complain at our using the 
B.B.C. for this purpose, since he made his statement outside the House. 
If Lord Balniel did speak on the 
"World At One" you would of course still be free to deal with the subject at Questions this afternoon; but

AUTHORITIES TO ACCOUNT FOR MURPHY’S DETENTION, BUT IT APPEARS HIGHLY DESIRABLE THAT THE KNOW/FACTS SHOULD BE STATED PUBLICLY AND WITHOUT DELAY. SUCH A STATEMENT WOULD BE OF NO VALUE UNLESS IT DEALT WITH THE REASONS FOR MURPHY’S PRESENCE IN A PRISON HOSPITAL

Ref. A0773 PRIME MINISTER 
GEN 47: Northern Ireland There is only half an hour for this meeting on Monday morning 
before the Cabinet; and we should therefore try to confine the agenda to items which need, and are susceptible of, prompt decision. These appear to be as follows:(1) 
Report on the situation over the weekend. (2) Use of Firearms by the Police. 
Belfast telegram no. 110 of 
15th November reports that the Policy Authority adopted on 12th November a resolution "that automatic weapons of an appropriate type and calibre should be made available to members of the RUC when called upon to perform any duty which, in the opinion of the Chief Constable, requires them for the member’s own protection or the protection of life or property". The telegram indicates that if this request is conceded automatic weapons will be permissible for vehicle patrols in dangerous areas but will not be carried by policemen on foot duty. But this is only implicit in the resolution; and I think that the Home Secretary will in any event argue against any extension of the existing arrangement whereby automatic weapons may be held in police stations for the defence of the stations themselves. 
This is probably right - the more so since one of the two 
members of the Police Authority who voted against the resolution has indicated that he and his colleague may well be obliged to resign if the request is granted. (3) A "continuing Compton". This subject is discussed in GEN 47(71) 4; 
and the most reasonable answers to the questions listed in that memorandum appear to be as follows:(a) Paragraph 2(a). We have hitherto tended to take it for granted that some standing machinery must be established. 
But there is force 
in the contention in paragraph 3 that the point does not seem to have attracted much public attention; and we could perhaps let a decision stand over for a little longer. 
If we could dispense with standing machinery entirely, that would be a satisfactory outcome. 
(b) Paragraph 2(b). A standing inquiry should preferably be confined to allegations which directly involve the United Kingdom Government, i.e. those which involve the Army. (Note that Belfast telegram no. 110 of 15th November suggests that the

The Rt Hon The Lord Carrington PC KCMG MC Secretary of State for Defence Ministry of Defence ain Building 
November 1971 
Now that the Compton Report has been published and debated, I hope you will allow me to express my admiration and deep gratitude 
- both personally and on behalf of the whole Army 
for the magnificent support which you personally, and your ministerial colleagues within and outside the Ministry, have given to us. 
I realise very keenly that you were placed in an embarrassing position and that the burden of defending it in public rests heavily on you and your colleagues. 
Soldiers are often prone 
to make disparaging remarks about their political masters. We like to think that qualities such as loyalty, integrity, courage and honour are the prime virtues of the military. You personally and your colleagues have shown us, the soldiers, in this case that you can set us all a splendid example in this respect, and we are deeply grateful. 
If you think it proper, I would be glad if you could pass on my thanks to the Prime Minister and to your colleagues, particularly to the Minister of State, who has had to bear the burden in the House of Com mons, and to the members of the Ministerial Committee on Northern Ireland. 
You will be glad to know that the Head of the RUC Special Branch has expressed his sincere thanks to the Director of Intelligence at HQ Northern Ireland for the support they received, particularly in accepting that it was a fully joint operation.

BGS(Int) SecHOC 
Sir Philip Allen Sir Burke Trend Sir Dick White Mr Howard Drake 
EVIDENCE TO THE PARKER COMMITTEE 1. 
2. AUS (GS) I attach a note which Mr Whitmore let me have yesterday 
evening following a discussion which BGS(Int) and he had with the Intelligence Coordinator and the Secretary of the JIC. 
I discussed this note with my Parker group this morning, 
of which Sir Dick White, VGS, DGI and Mr Howard Drake of the Home Office are all members. The points which we wish to put to you now are summarised in this minute. 
Sir Dick White’s Evidence 3. 
We feel that the Committee will wish to see Sir Dick White 
very early in their proceedings. We agreed this morning that it would be desirable that VCGS should also attend with Sir Dick White in order to deal with the military aspects of the problem which the Committee will no doubt wish to raise. 
4. It was also agreed at my meeting this morning that it would 
be right for Sir Dick White to deal generally with the points referred to in paragraphs 2-5 of the attached paper. The crucial question is what he says if he is asked his personal opinion as to the way in which the general principles should be applied in practice. Should he, for example, explain the views contained in his recent report about,eg, the hours that people should be hooded and made to stand against a wall? We were generally agreed that it would be wrong at this stage for him to make a copy of his recent report available to the Committee. 
5. We are on pretty safe ground in explaining why the various 
methods used are necessary for security reasons or for the protection of the interrogators and of the people being interrogated. Where we get on to more difficult ground is in explaining and justifying the methods used for the softening up of the interrogatees. This is really the crucial issue on which the Committee have been set up to advise.

D/HOC/18/1 
MA/VCGS The Intelligence Co-ordinator DGI 
AUS(GS) BGS(Int Secretary, JIC Mr. Howard-Drake, Home Office 
EVIDENCE TO THE PARKER COMMITTEE The Intelligence Co-ordinator held a meeting this morning which 
the Secretary of the JIC, BGS(Int) and I attended, to consider the main points which he should make to the Parker Committee when he first appears before them and to identify the issues on which decisions will be needed before his first appearance. 
The Co-ordinator’s opening evidence 2. 
In general terms the line which the Co-ordinator proposes to 
take in his opening evidence is first to explain the need of the security forces for accurate and fresh information in any campaign against terrorists. He will emphasise that the information must be obtained quickly if it is to be of any value and that this recuirement for speed is the major difference between interrogation conducted by or on behalf of the Army and interrogation by the civilian agencies who do not normally have to work against time. 
3. The Co-ordinator will also mention that a further difference 
between military and civilian interrogation is that the former is normally carried out in field conditions where there is often a possibility of external attack and thus of interrogation being interrupted, whereas civilian interrogation can be carried out in a completely secure environment. 
4. The Co-ordinator also proposes to point out to the Committee 
that a steady flow of accurate, up-to-date information from interrogation is important not only for the immediate successes against the terrorists which it leads to but also for the effect it has on the morale and cohesiveness of the terrorists who know that information about themselves is being given by their erstwhile colleagues to superior forces to use against them. 
5. 6. The Co-ordinator then intends to say something about the dilemma 
of devising methods of interrogation which are effective in producing information but which are acceptable in a democratic society. 
This will lead on to the present rules for the conduct of 
interrogation, and the Co-ordinator will have to make clear that these are general rules only which give guidelines to those responsible for carrying out interrogation. Within these guidelines detailed practices are used which have been developed over the years largely on the basis of our experience in successive emergency situations abroad (on which the Committee will have a background paper now being

Dear John, I am very glad that you are willing to serve on 
the Committee Of Privy Counsellors under the chairmanship of Lord Parker of Waddington. As the Home Secretary indicated in his statement 
in the House on 18 November the terms of reference will be: 
"To consider whether, and if so in what 
respects, the procedures currently authorised for the interrogation of persons suspected of terrorism and for their custody while subject to interrogation require amendment." I have told Lord Parker that I should be grateful 
to receive the Committee’s report as soon as possible. The Government intend that the report should be published subject to any omissions which may be judged necessary on ground of security.

SPEAKING NOTE FOR MINISTERS COMPTON REPORT: ARMY AND RUC VINDICATED In speaking about the Report of the enquiry into allegations against 
the security forces of physical brutality in Northern Ireland arising out of the events of the 9th August, 1971, the following points might be made 
1. All charges of brutality against British troops and the RUC were demolished. Sir Edmund Compton’s Committee reported that it found no evidence of brutality, still less of torture or brain washin-. The great majority of allegations are either found not to have been proved or to have been untrue. 
2. The allegations examined by the Committee fell into two classes: those relating to the initial arrests and a small number concerned with the later process of interrogation. Arrests 
- 342 men were arrested on August 9 in a highly successful 
operation in very difficult circumstances. No force but the minimum necessary was used to achieve arrest. The men concerned were likely to resist arrest and many of them were likely to be armed; in these circumstances the army’s performance was highly creditable. 
Interrogation - Interrogations are carried out by the security forces upon principles laid down under the previous administration and confirmed by the present administration. 
Very difficult 
issues are involved in judging what methods of interrogation are permissible in the protection of the lives of the civil population and the security forces against a ruthless and deliberate campaign of terror and murder. 
That is why the Government has appointed 
a committee of Privy Councillors under Lord Parker to enquire into them and see whether changes are necessary. 
3. The whole operation, arrests followed by the interrogation of a small number of suspects (14),yielded information of great value without which the security forces could not defend the ordinary civilian against the campaign of terror and murder. 
4. The operation should be seen against the background of the fight against a ruthless and murderous enemy; that is to say criminals who ish to impose their will by violence and terror. This year there have been over 800 bomb explosions in Northern Ireland; hospitals have treated nearly 600 victims of violence; of these more than 200 were British soldiers; almost two thirds of the civilian casualties were women including girls disfigured for life in explosions. These things have been done by the IRA.

PRIME MINISTER’S MEETING WITH LORD PARKER The Prime Minister will wish to begin by expressing the 
Government’s gratitude to Lord Parker for agreeing to chair the enquiry. Other Members 2. 
As Lord Parker will know from the Home Secretary’s letter 
of 12 November (copy attached), his two colleagues will be Privy Counsellors, like himself. One will be nominated by the Government and the other by the Opposition. Their names will be announced publicly in the near future. 3. 
The Secretary of the Committee will be Mr. N.E.A. Moore, an 
Assistant Secretary who until very recently was the Secretary of the Decimal Currency Board. Background to the enquiry 4. 
As Lord Parker will have seen from the copy of the Compton 
Report which the Home Secretary sent him with his letter, the Compton Committee have cleared the security forces in Northern Ireland of the allegations that they had committed acts of physical brutality against those who were interrogated in depth following their 
arrest under the Special Powers Act, but the Committee nonetheless as they were 
concluded that some of the procedures/used in support of interrogation 
- such as requiring detainees to wear hoods; making them stand with their hands against a wall; and the use of h 
continuous noise - amounted to physical ill-treatment. 5. 
The principles and methods governing the conduct of 
interrogation are those which have been employed in other emergency situations in which Her Majesty’s Government have been involved in recent years but in the light of the Compton Committee’s findings the Government now wish to consider whether fresh instructions are required. For this reason the Government have decided to set up

COMPTON REPORT STATEMENT MR. REGINALD MAUDLING With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement. The Report of the Committee under the Chairmanship of 
Sir Edmund Compton which I set up to inquire into allegations against the security forces of physical brutality in Northern Ireland arising out of events on 9 August is being published today and copies will be available in the Vote Office at 4 p.m. For completeness I should add that at my request Sir E.Compton 
himself also investigated allegations in respect of three persons named in the Sunday Times issue of 17 October who were arrested after 9 August. Copies of this Supplementary report will also be available in the Vote Office at 4 p.m. The rest of my statement is concerned only with the main report. The Government are grateful to the members of the Committee 
of Inquiry for the care and thoroughness with which they carried out their difficult task. Following the precedent of the Bowen report on Aden in 1966 
the report is published with an introduction by myself as Minister appointing the Inquiry. The Government have not found it necessary to omit anything from the Report on grounds of security and it is, therefore, published in full. The Compton Committee found no evidence of physical brutality 
by the British Army or the RUC, still less of torture or brainwashing. In the course of the arrest of 342 men on 9 August a small number of them suffered what the Committee describe as a measure of

Ref. A0744 PRIME MINISTER 
Northern Ireland The points with which we should try to deal at tomorrow morning’s 
meeting of GEN 47 can perhaps be summarised as follows:(i) The Home Secretary’s Statement on the Compton Report A draft approved by the Home Secretary himself is attached. 
In 
discussion this morning we thought that it would need to be amended in the following respects:(a) A new paragraph 2 should be inserted to refer to the second Compton report which is to be "published" by being placed in the Library simultaneously with publication of the main report at 4. 00 p. m. You have already seen a copy of this. 
(b) Paragraph 6. The last words might be amended to read "... in a highly creditable manner". 
(c) Paragraph 8. The second half of the sentence should be amended to read "... the same as those which have been used in other struggles against armed terrorists [alternatively,other emergencies of this kind in which Britain has been involved in recent years". The main point of this amendment is to eliminate the reference to 20 years,which is perhaps a shade too precise. 
precise occasions 
It has in fact proved difficult to track down the - and the length of the periods involved - on 
(d) Paragraph 9. 
which the methods in question have been used in the past. But the attached letter from Sir James Dunnett suggests that we are on pretty safe ground in maintaining that the Labour Government shares the responsibility fully with Conservative Governments. This must contain the terms of reference of the 
Privy Counsellors’ inquiry. These might be "To consider whether, and if so in what respects, the procedures currently in force for the interrogation of persons suspected of terrorism and for their custody while subject to interrogation require amendment for future use". 
This wording follows the Home 
Office suggestion in GEN 47(71) 1 with the addition of the words "for future use", which are designed to head the Committee off from too much reraking of the ground which Compton has already covered.

15 November 1971 
Sir Burke Trend GCB CVO Cabinet Office Whitehall London SW1 
You asked me once or twice about occasions on which, over the past few years, interrogation in depth has been carried out. 
2. The geographical answer to this question is simple - ie 
Malaysia, Kenya, Cyprus, Brunei and Aden. 3. 
The dates on which interrogation in depth was carried out is 
a more difficult matter. All the records in question were held by the Special Branches concerned and not by the British Services. We cannot now consult them. 
4. We are therefore driven back to the question of the dates 
between which these overseas emergencies occurred. This is not quite as simple a question as might at first appear. For example, if one uses as a base the local Orders in Council, under the authority of which the High Commissioner or Governor concerned declared the beginning and the end of states of emergency the figures which emerge are as follows: 
Kenya 
Cyprus Aden 
... ... ... 
1952-1960 1955-1959 1963-1967 
Our Library here is still trying to establish the formal dates of the state of emergency in Brunei and Malaysia; the dates of the eligibility of the General Services Medal were 1962-1966, which I would have thought were good enough for our immediate purposes. 
5. Having given you the above figures related to the relevant Orders 
in Council, I should add that declared active service in so far as Kenya is concerned was from 1952 to 1956 and, so far as Aden is concerned,declared active service lasted only from August to November 1967.

A MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER AS FOLLOWS: BEGINS. I HAVE SEEN FROM REPORTS OF STATEMENTS IN THE DAIL, THAT YOUR 
GOVERNMENT IS ACTIVELY CONSIDERING BRINGING BEFORE THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ALLEGATIONS THAT HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR BRUTALITY AND INHUMAN TREATMENT IN CONNEXION WITH THOSE ARRESTED AND INTERROGATED IN NORTHERN IRELAND. I SHOULD MUCH REGRET IF YOUR DECISION WAS TO TAKE SUCH ACTION. I SAY THIS, NOT BECAUSE THERE IS ANYTHING WHICH MY GOVERNMENT WOULD WISH TO CONCEAL. YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE THAT, FOLLOWING WIDESPREAD ALLEGATIONS IN THE PRESS THAT BRUTAL TREATMENT HAD BEEN INFLICTED ON MEN ARRESTED ON 9 AUGUST, MY GOVERNMENT SET UP A COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THESE, UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF SIR EDMUND COMPTON, AND THAT THIS COMMITTEE RECENTLY REPORTED. THEIR REPORT, WHICH WAS MADE AFTER VERY THOROUGH INVESTIGATION BUT VIRTUALLY WITHOUT THE COOPERATION OF THOSE ABOUT WHOM THE ALLEGATIONS HAD BEEN MADE, SHOWED THAT IN REGARD TO THE INITIAL ARRESTS THERE WERE VERY FEW COMPLAINTS AND THOSE THAT THERE WERE HAD IN THE COMMITTEE’S VIEW VERY LITTLE SUBSTANCE. NO FORCE BUT THE MINIMUM HAD BEEN USED TO ACHIEVE ARREST AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE WHATEVER OF DELIBERATE BRUTALITY ON THE PART OF ANY OF THE ARMED FORCES INVOLVED. WITH REGARD TO THE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THE METHODS USED DURING INTERROGATION THE COMMITTEE’S FINDINGS WERE THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF PHYSICAL BRUTALITY, STILL LESS OF TORTURE OR BRAINWASHING, BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN PHYSICAL ILL-TREATMENT WHICH RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE METHODS USED IN INTERROGATION. IN THE LIGHT OF THESE LAST FINDINGS, THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT TO SET UP A BODY TO REVIEW THE PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE METHODS OF INTERROGATION USED, IN VIEW OF THE VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES THAT ARISE WHERE THE SECURITY FORCES ARE ENGAGED AGAINST A RUTHLESS AND DELIBERATE
