NORTHERN IRELAND 
Common Assumptions There are various possible approaches to be a political initiative, 
but some common underlying assumptions. a. 
That movement is urgent from the points of view of both (i) the domestic situation in Northern Ireland; and (ii) the political situation in the Republic: both of which are affected by Sunday’s trouble in Londonderry. 
b. 
That meetings and conferences are unlikely in themselves to produce a solution; that we must therefore have our own solution: as to which see paragraph 3 below. 
c. 
That the inter-party talks at Westminster will have to go on if the Leader of the Opposition agrees, but that in the circumstances little productive result is to be expected. 
2. n general there may be 3 broad lines of approach. a. 
To hold a conference of political representatives in Northern Ireland for those who are prepared to come. This course could be combined with others: and it would be of the essence that the purpose would be to consider firm proposals by us: not to evolve possible solutions. The advantage would be the appearance of immediate action and a demonstration where the responsibility lay if some people failed to come. The disadvantages would be that no one would expect much from it and that our own proposals might lose their value in argument and discussion. 
b. 
To hold secret negotiations, first with r. Faulkner, to see if he could be persuaded to operate our plans; and then with Mr . Lynch to try to gain his support (while avoiding his "connivance"), and

NORTHERN IRELAND: MIPT. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THE LAST CLAUSE OF PARAGRAPH 12 
IN MIPT IS PREGNANT AND OF COURSE EXPLAINS THE INABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE IRISH REPUBLIC TO CONTROL IRA ACTIVITY IN EIRE. BUT UNTIL SUCH ACTIVITY IN EIRE IS SEVERELY REDUCED OUR ABILITY TO REDUCE GUERILLA VIOLENCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS IN CONSTANT JEOPARDY. THIS WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE ONE KEY IN THE SITUATION. 2. MEANWHILE EVEN IN BASICALLY FAVOURABLY DISPOSED CIRCLES IN THIS COUNTRY (INCLUDING THE WHITE HOUSE) THE CREDITABILITY OF OUR POLICIES ARE WANING. UNLESS YOU DISAPPROVE I WOULD LIKE TO SEEK A PERSONAL INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT NIXON TO SUGGEST PRESSURE BY US ON GOVERNMENT OF IRISH REPUBLIC TO SUPPRESS IRA AND OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES IN EIRE.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CONGRESSIONAL ACTIVITY. 1. WE LEARNED TODAY THAT THE SUB-COMMITTEE ON EUROPE OF THE HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE HAVE SCHEDULED HEARINGS ON NORTHERN IRELAND FOR 28-29 FEBRUARY AND 1 MARCH. INVITATIONS HAVE BEEN SENT BY THE COMMITTEE TO ABOUT 80 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAVE ALL SPONSORED RESOLUTIONS OR LEGISLATION OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER MENTIONING THE NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION. INVITATIONS TO TESTIFY HAVE ALSO BEEN SENT TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND TO SOME OF THE IRISH AMERICAN GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
2. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THESE HEARINGS WILL BE HEAVILY BIASED AGAINST HMG. THE MEMBER OF THE STAFF OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE WHO TOLD US OF THE HEARINGS RECOGNISED THAT THIS WOULD BE THE CASE BUT FELT UNABLE TO SUGGEST ANY WAY IN WHICH HMG’S CASE MIGHT BE SATISFACTORILY PRESENTED. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ANYONE FROM A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT (OR NORMALLY FOR FOREIGN CITIZENS) TO TESTIFY AND HE KNEW OF NO GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES WHO WOULD ARGUE THE CASE FOR THE OTHER SIDE VERY STRONGLY. WE REMINDED HIM THAT THE APPEAL FOR CONSCIENCE FEDERATION HAD PRODUCED A RESPONSIBLE AND WELL BALANCED REPORT ON THE SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND SOME TIME AGO AND.WE ARE MENTIONING TO HIM THE NORTHERN IRELAND SERVICE COUNCIL WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY ORGANISATION OF ULSTERMEN IN THE UNITED STATES IN ANY WAY COMPARABLE WITH THE CATHOLIC ORIENTATED IRISH AMERICAN GROUPS.

FM AMEMBASSY DUBLIN TO AMEMBASSY LONDON 714 
DUBLIN TEL NO. 2 OF 3 FEB. TO FCO 
1. I CALLED ON THE TAOISECAH AT NOON TODAY, HAVING MADE THE APPOINTMENT THROUGH MCCANN LAST EVENING. HE LOOKED GREY AND GHASTLY AND WAS MUCH PUT OUT AT MY ARRIVAL AS HE HAD APPARENTLY SENT A MESSAGE, WHICH NEVE REACHED ME, TO SATY THAT HE HAD TO OPEN AN EMERGENCY DEBATE IN THE DAIL AT 2 P.M. AND COULD NOT SEE ME UNTIL AFTER THAT. HOWEVER, AS I WAS THERE HE WOULD HEAP WHAT I HAD TO SAY, BUT COULD I PLEASE MAKE IT QUICK AS HE HAD TO PEPARE HIS SPEECH. 
2. I SAID THAT I HAD TO REPEAT WHAT HAD BEEN SAID TO HIS CHAPGE D’AFFAIRES YESTERDAY ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF MY EMBASSY, AND I HAD NOTED THE PROMISE OF HIS GOVERNMENT TO MAKE FULL RECOMPENSE. I HAD BEEN IN LONDON FOR 2 DAYS AND WAS HORRIFIED TO FIND MY EMBASSY IN FLAMES ON MY RETURN. I WAS EVEN MORE HORRIFIED BY THE NEWS IN THIS MORNING’S PAPERS OF THE INSANE HOLLIGANISM THROUGHOUT DUBLIN LATER LAST NIGHT WHICH HAD APPARENTLY INCLUDED THE AIMLESS DAMAGE TO IPISH-CWNED BUSINESS PROPERTY AND THE PETROL BOMBINGS OF A MATERNITY HOME. I COULD ONLY CONCLUDE THAT THERE WAS A TOTAL BREAKDOWN IN LAW AND ORDER. 
2. IN LONDON THE PRIME MINISTER HAD SUGGESTED THAT THE SPECIAL AIRCRAFT BRINGING ME BACK TO DUBLIN SHOULD STAND BY TO EVACUATE EMBASSY FAMILIES. I HAD TAKEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF POSTPONING SUCH A DRASTIC DECISION FOR AT LEAST 24 HOURS. DUPING THE NIGHT THE LANDLORD OF ONE OF MY FIRST SECRETARIES, WHCSE WIFE IS EXPECTING A BABY, HAD BEEN THPEATENED WITH VIOLENCE IF HE DID NOT EJECT THE YOUNG COUPLE. I WAS MAKING ALL NECESSARY DISPOSITIONS TO EVACUATE EMBASSY FAMILIES AND UNESSENTIAL MEMBERS OF THE STAFF AND WOULD TAKE MY DECISION ON SATURDAY. 
3. THE CRUCIAL FACTOR WOULD BE WHETHER THE ILLEGAL MARCH WOULD TAKE PLACE IN NEWRY ON SUNDAY. IF IT DID, ONE MUST ASSUME THAT THE ORGANISERS WOULD DO THEIR BEST TO KEEP IT ORDERLY, BUT THAT FIRST, HOLLIGAN ELEMENTS, AND THEN THE IRA WOULD ATTACK THE POLICE, IN WHICH CASE THE ARMY WOULD BE OBLIGED TO COKE TO THEIR DEFENCE, AND, AS IN LONDONDERRY, THERE WOULD BE BLOODSHED AND ANOTHER CHAIN REACTION.SINCE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IN SUCH.A SITUATION THE IRISH GOVERNMENT WAS INCAPABLE OF MAINTAINING LAW AND OPDER, ISHOULD NATURALLY BE OBLIGED TO ANTICIPATE TROUBLE BY EVACUATING STAFF. I WOULD NOT MAKE THIS INTENTION PUBLIC, BUT IT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BE BOUND TO LEAK. 
4. I SAID THAT THE IRISH GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN FOREMOST IN THE INSISTENCE UPON BANNING PROCESSIONS AND MARCHES THE LEAST 
MR. LYNCH COULD DO WOULD 
THE MARCH WITH ALL ITS ATTENDANT RSIKS. HE SHOULD DISSUADE ANYONE FROM THE REPUBLIC WHO THOUGHT OF CORSSING TO NEWRY TO TAKE A PART IN AN PEACEFUL BUT ILLEGAL MARCH, AND FINALLY, HE 
SHOULD REALISE THAT THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE A LARGE CONCENTRATION OF I.R.A. GUNMEN IN THE AREA WELL PLACED 
TO BE PICKED UP BY THE SECURITY AUTHORITIES. 5. MR. LYNCH COMPLAINED BITTERLY THAT HE WAS ALWAYS THE ONE WHO 
BE TO DISUADE THE ORGANISERS FROM HOLDING WASK ASKFD TO STICK HIS NECK OUT. HE DID NOT KNOW WHO HAD FIRED FIRST

Northern Ireland: Political Reform At the end of the last GEN 47 meeting officials were 
asked to give further consideration, in the light of the discussion, to the options which now seemed open to the Government. We have talked this over; and the result is attached. 
I would not claim that it is agreed in every detail; but I hope that it clarifies some of the issues and may therefore serve as the basis for the next round of Ministerial discussion. There is no question, of course, of its being intended 
for disclosure to our visitor tomorrow. But Ministers may care to have it at the back of their minds during that meeting. I am sending copies of this minute and the document 
annexed to the Home Secretary, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Lord President and the Secretary of State for Defence.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 682 FE BRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours As on Monday, there was a good deal of shooting and other 
violence in Belfast and, to a lesser extent, in rural areas - but almost complete quiet in Londonderry, with only occasional reversions to hooliganism. 2. 
In Belfast there were 31 shooting incidents in all. In one of 
them a soldier of 1 Glosters was shot dead at Hastings Street RUC station. In other incidents, two soldiers were slightly wounded, and two civilians were also injured 
- one of them a woman who received a 
shot in the chest while an Army patrol was being fired on- without returning the fire. 3. 
Outside Belfast there were six shooting incidents, in one of 
which an off-duty UDR soldier was shot and wounded while working on his farm north of Enniskillen. There were also two instances of firing across the border. In one of these, near Warrenpoint at the head of Carlingford Loch, gunmen fired at a patrol from a derelict house in the Republic; the fire was returned, 
some tracer 
ammunition being used which set fire to the house. After the shooting had continued for some time the Gardai arrived. It is not yet known whether there is any truth in reports that three bodies. of gunmen were subsequently removed from the house. The other crossborder shooting was at Belleek. 4. 
Hooliganism continued at a high level in Belfast throughout the day and there were many cases n the city - as well as some elsewhere 
of vehicles being hijacked and set on fire or made into barricades. A Protestant shop was set on fire in the Ardoyne. So was a shop in Strabane belonging to a JP, and a Customs post on the border was burned down. 5. 
There were eight arrests of wanted persons, who included two

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 67 1 FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours It was an uneasy day in Belfast, with frequent outbreaks of 
shooting and rioting. Altogether ’there were 3 shoo ng incidents, in the course of which three soldiers were wounded and four gdnmen were reported as having been hit. 2. 
Much of the shooting and rioting - in which numerous nail, blast 
and petrol bombs were also thrown - occurred in the Falls and Andersonstown areas as troops attempted to dismantle barricades which had just been set up - usually consisting of a hijacked vehicle. There were large fires at a printing works in the centre of Belfast and at a brewery in Andersonstown. 3. 
There were also five bomb explosions, including a large one in 
the centre of the city in which eleven people were injured, two of them being policemen (one of them seriously injured). 4. 
After the shootings of the previous day, Londonderry was generally 
quiet, though very tense. There was one shooting incident and a brief outbreak of stoning. Throughout the rest of the Province there were various strikes and rallies in protest at the events in Londonderry on Sunday. In Lurgan a former mayor of the town was attacked and wounded in his home by five armed men. 5. 
On the border in south Armagh, a 300 lb bomb - the largest yet recorded in Northern Ireland since 1969 
its command wires leading over the border. It was successfully defused. There was one cross-border shooting incident. 
- was found in a school, with

23 February, 1972 I am enclosing a summary of Emergency Powers Legislation 
in the Irish Republic, and also a short summary of the use of the Powers since 1939. As you will see, the legislation falls under two heads, 
- the Offences against the State Act, and 
the Emergency Powers Act. Although the Emergency Powers Act is still in force, it is unlikely that the Irish Government would now use it in preference to the Offences against the State Act which provided the powers used in 1956-62. 
Detention and special criminal courts are separate 
weapons to be used as appropriate according to circumstances : the courts give fixed sentences, whereas detention or interment have no fixed term. The special courts are sometimes referred to as military courts because during the Second World War they were staffed by Army Officers; such courts are not to be confused with Courts Martial, which can only try persons who are or who have been made subject to military law. 
I am also enclosing a short summary of the relevant 
extract from Mr. O’Malley’s statement on 20 February, together with a copy of Section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act 1936, to which Mr. O’Malley referred. You will recall Mr. O’Malley told the Fianna Fail Party Conference that some recent decisions in lower courts had been inexplicable and those then discharged could nonetheless be brought before a higher court. 
Since this letter and its enclosures may be of general 
interest, I am sending copies to Gregson (No. 10), Angel (Home Office) and Andrew (MOD).

special courts) is enshrined in four Acts: the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940, and the Emergency Powers Acts, 1939 and 1940. 
Legislation and Powers 2. 
The Offences Against the State Act, 1939 (which came 
into force on 14 June, 1939 lays down penalties against persons who seek to usurp the function of government, obstruct government or try to interfere with military or other employees of the state. It prohibits the printing and publishing of certain documents, the possession of such documents and the distribution of foreign newspapers containing seditious material. It also prohibits unauthorised 
military exercises (Section 15), secret societies in the army or police (Section 16) and the administering of unlawful oaths (Section 17). 
3. Part 3 declares that certain organisations (which are 
described but not named) shall be unlawful. The Government may issue a Suppression Order against any organisation it deems unlawful; it is then unlawful for any person to be a member of that organisation, and the property of the organisation is forfeit to the Minister for Justice. Part 4 of the Act prohibits meetings held by unlawful organisations. 
4. Part 5 of the Act, dealing with special criminal courts, is 
to be brought into force "if and whenever and so often as the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order and that it is therefore necessary that this part of this Act should come into force 
... ". The Government The Government may bring Part 5 into effect 
by proclamation(and annul the proclamation by a subsequent one); Dail Eireann can annul the first proclamation by passing a resolution to that effect (Section 36(6)). 
may by Order declare that particular cusses of offences shall be scheduled offences for the purposes of Part 5 of the Act, and every such offence must be tried by the special courts. 
5. Part 5 also provides for "special criminal courts" to 
consist of an uneven number of at least 3 members, appointed and removed at will by the Government, drawn from judges of the High, Circuit or District Court, barristers and solicitors of not less than 7 years’ standing, and officers of the Defence Forces not below the rank of Commandant. Verdicts are by majority: each court has power to lay down its own procedure (eg on the admission or exclusion of the public, the enforcing of the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents) with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice. The practice and procedure of the ordinary criminal courts are to apply "so far as practicable" to the special criminal courts: rules of evidence are to apply. Provision is made for appeals

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 83 -. 23 FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours Events in Northern Ireland itself were of course largely 
overshadowed by the explosion at Aldershot, details of which have already been reported 
- and covered very fully in the Press. 
the Province, the level of activity was much the same as usual in recent weeks. 2. 
Within In Belfast there were four explosions and four shooting incidents, 
in one of which a civilian was injured. There was also some trouble in the Ardoyne during the early stagesof the funeral of David cAuley, the fourteen-year-old youth who died in the Republic on Saturday from a gunshot wound. As several hundred mourners assembled round the coffin, a volley of five shots was fired over it. Two sections of 1 QLR who were standing by tried to break through the crowd to arrest those who had fired the volley; whilst doing so they were jostled and the platoon commander was knocked down and kicked in the face. He was extricated after two baton rounds had been fired and also one rifle-shot into the area. In the melee one woman was injured. Once the cortege started moving the procession became orderly, though some of its members were in breach of the law in wearing para-military uniforms. McAuley’s father, who is an internee at Long esh, was allowed out on parole for the funeral he had not reported back by 4 p.m. 3. 
In Londonderry there were outbreaks of shooting, two of them at troops - without casualties. There was also the usual amount of 
hooligan activity during the afternoon, but it was observed that some adults seemed to be trying to persuade the youths to disperse. It is the first time this has been seen happening for some time. 4. 
In the rural areas there were three shooting incidents. In one

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT MO 82 22 FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours Explosions provided the two main incidents. A car, which had 
been reported as stolen, blew up as it was travelling through the Castlereagh area in South East Belfast, killing the four occupants. All four were from the Short Strand (Ballymacaratt) area and are believed to have been members of the Provisional IRA; it seems quite clear that the explosion was caused by a bomb which they were carrying in, the car. Two pistols were found in the wreckage of the car. There were two other explosions in Belfast. 2. 
At Dungannon a bomb which had been placed on the fire escape 
outside a restaurant in the market square caused minor damage to the building. There were no casualties. Among those in the restaurant at the time were six SNLP Members of Parliament at Stormont and three Senators; it is believed that a meeting of the executive of the Assembly of the Northern Ireland People

Londonderry, without casualties. An armed robbery occurred in Maghera. 4. 
Three wanted persons were arrested. One of them, Patrick McVeagh 
has been charged with the murder of Det. Sgt. McInney on 25 November 1971. Further information given by the Provisional who was arrested in Glasgow at the weekend led to another discovery of weapons and ammunition in the Falls area, this time in the roof of a girls secondary school in Beechmount Avenue. It comprised two rifles, three pistols, 23 assorted magazines and 6300 rounds of ammunition.

22 February 1972 
Prime Minister on the afternoon of 21 February there was some discussion of a possible politcal initiative in Northern Ireland. 
When the Home Secretary came to see the 
more convinced that the time for such an initiative had come. The most recent letter from r. Faulkner showed that the lster Unionists wanted to have it both ways: they wanted Northern Ireland to continue to be part of the United Kingdom, but on their terms. 
The Home ecretary said that he became more and 
the Cabinet Office to arrange for Ministers to be provided urgently with a specific and detailed analysis of what was involved in the sort of proposals which Ministers had been considering. Ministers would need to see what was proposed in considerable detail. before they could make up their minds what course to follow. Only if this could be one could they assess the risks; it was above all important to try to avoid the danger of fighting both sides at once. 
The Prime Minister said that he would be asking 
The Home Secretary was inclined to the view that the Unionists and the Protestants would 
accept the sort of arrangement which Ministers had in mind, provided that they were given firm guarantees about the border. The Prime Minister and the Home 
Secretary agreed that in the changed circumstances envisaged a referendum on the border would become an Important part, supplementing the pledge in the 1949 Act, of the constitutional guarantees for the border since it would ensure that unification could not be

HQ NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL FEBRUARY 1972 
0700 HRS 18 
General 1. The week has seen a further reduction in the numbers of shooting incidents. Although military casualties are well down they contain two particularly brutal murders; a soldier 
visiting his sick and widowed mother in Dublin, and a UDR busdriver. A number of the shooting incidents have also involved IRA ’Justice’. Bomb attacks remain at last Week level but were concentrated mainly in Belfast. However, it is too soon to say whether this is a real reversal of recent trends. For the first time a bomb was found on a ferry, the Heysham/Belfast ferry on 17 February. The bomb, consisting of 40 lbs of gelignite in a suitcase, failed to explode because of a malfunction. 
2. Two ’marches’ took place during the period. The first, at Enniskillen on Sunday, was not a success. The organisers initially stated that 20,000 would attend. In the event, some 1,200-1,500 took part, nearly all of the ’Rent-a-crowd’ type from elsewhere in the Province and from Eire. There was no confrontation with the Security Forces. The other, at Londonderry on Thursday, was in protest against the murder of the UDR busdriver. It was orderly, Protestant, and did not breakthe ban because the 1,000 who took part kept to the pavements. They walked from Altnagelvin to Ebrington Barracks where they expressed disgust at the murder, concern about the lawlessnss of the Croggan and Bogside and support for the Security Forces. 
3. Following recent successful escapes, two further attemps took place at Crumlin Jail, on 12 February, and Magilligan, on 16 February.. Both were thwarted by the prison staff. Two 
accomplices were captured outside Crumlin Jail by 2 RRF. 4. Attacks on the homes of UDR resulted in the loss of four more SLRs. On two other occasions the gunmen, failed in their attempts. 
5. In two successful clashes with gunmen, 45 Cdo RM captured two terrorists in Ligoniel on 13 February, and an RUC patrol captured three more, (one of whom is under suspicion for the murder of a soldier in Lurgan on 7 November 1971) following an attempted wages snatch at Lurgan on 17 February. 
Propaganda 
6. The big propaganda issue is the Widgery Tribunal. Its terms of reference have been attacked as being too narrow and preventing investigation of decisions loading up to thu shootings in Londonderry. The Tribunal’s impartiality has been questioned on the lines that it is the British establishment which is on trial and an appointee of the establishment cannot be impartial. Demands for an international member on the tribunal have been made. Attacks on the impartiality of Lord Widgery have laid stres on his war record. The SDLP MP John Hume made the running in this campaign. By the end of the week,

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 8121 FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 72 hours The number of incidents during the weekend was fairly high, 
although none of them was outstandingly serious. They included 49 shooting incidents 
- over half of them in londonderry - 20 explosions 
and nine armed robberies; there were injuries to four soldiers, two policemen and.seven civilians. 2. 
Two soldiers were hit by gunfire in Londonderry on Saturday 
both of them members of 22 Light AD Regiment RA. The first was hit in the head and very seriously wounded when a shot was fired from the Bogside at an observation post. Two hours later the other. was hit in the leg. in the William Street area. Troops twice opened fire at gunmen and.on the second occasion the man, who was carrying a pistol, was seen to fall and was removed by car. On Sunday there were 19 shooting incidents in the city, in which 96 shots were fired at the security forces and 88 rounds were returned. Agunman who was firing from the spire of St. Eugene’s RC Cathedral may have been hit. On both days there was fairly extensive hooligan activity which had to be dispersed, with baton rounds and CS. 3. 
The two policemen were wounded - one of them seriously - on 
Saturday near the border south of Newtownhamilton, when the car in which they were travelling was fired on from a following car. On the same afternoon an Army patrol in the Middletown area came under fire from across the border: there were no casualties and the fire was not returned. That evening a soldier was injured at a vehicle check point when he was knocked down by a car and sustained a fractured skull; it was apparently/of drunken driving. On Sunday there were two attempts by small crowds from the Republic to fill in craters in unapproved roads at points north of the border, but they were persuaded to turn back after there had been some minor disturbances. There was

SPECIAL COURT Recognizing the political impasse, and feeling of community 
alienation, resulting from internment, but also recogizing that the needs of justice demand that witnesses and jurors should be free from physical fear we recommend the follwing:- 
That a Special Court should be set up to try offences under the undermentioned Acts: (i) Explosive substances Act 1893 S2,3,4, & 5. (11) Firearms Act (N.I.) 1969 S14,15,16,18 18(1), 19. (111) Explosive substances Act 1875 S4, & 5. (lv) Protection of Persons and Property Act (N.I.) 1969 S1,2,3. (v) 
Public Order (Amendment) Act (N.I.) S7.8.(if on indictment) Any person charged under the above provisions shall be tried at the 
Special Court. No bail shall be allowed on any of these charges unless there are special humanitarian reasons. COMPOSITION: A High Court Judge; and two Senior Queen’s Counsel appointed by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland to sit and assist the Judge. 
Those sitting on the Bench would have Inquisitional powers. 
PROCEDURE: A Crown Representative to present the case, and the Defendant would have a right to legal representation. WITNESSES: 
Police should attend the Court in person, but with the right to remain anonymous. Identities to be disclosed only to the bench. They would be subject to examination and cross-examination. CIVILIAN WITNESSES: 
- Witnesses who are members of the Security Forces or th - Would have the right if they so wished to giv 
evidence on affidavit only, and to be anonymous. Identities to be disclosed only to the Bench.

HENCE HIS EMPHASIS NOT ONLY ON REUNIFICATION, BUT ON MAKING THE DEMOCRATIC FORUM THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT AND ELECTORATE, AND ON LONDON-DUBLIN TALKS IN WHICH ALL PARTIES MAY JOIN.

LYNCH’S IMMEDIATE PREOCCUPATION IS TO SEE THE NORTHERN LOG JAM BROKEN, SINCE FRUSTRATION IN THE REPUBLIC IS DANGEROUS TO HIS OWN POSITION AND THE STATE. I WOULD THEREFORE EXPECT HiM TO GO ALONG WITH ANY PROPOSALS OF H M G, PROVIDED THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY WERE LIKELY TO PROVIDE SOME MOVEMENT (E.G. A MEANS OF ENDING INTERNMENT), WORK OF AN INTERIM NATURE, AND DID NOT EXCLUDE UNIFICATION. IF THEY COULD INCLUDE SOME IMPLICIT REFERENCE TO ULTIMATE UNIFICATION (E.G. THE IDEA OF AN INTERMITTENT REFERENDUM SO MUCH THE BETTER. THE SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF THE S D L P WOULD NOT CARRY MUCH WEIGHT WITH MR. LYNCH, WHO WOULD REGARD THEM IN THE LAST RESORT AS EXPENDABLE.

NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 11 FEBRUARY 1972 
- 17 FEBRUARY 1972 Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL 1. 
Mr Faulkner has continued in his speeches to emphasise the need for unity 
amongst Unionists but also to retain some room for manoeuvre for his Government on the question of political reforms. Opposition politicians in Northern Ireland have encouraged non-participation in Lord Widgery’s Tribunal claiming that its terms of reference have been interpreted too narrowly. 
2. The acquittal of seven members of the Provisional IRA in the Republic has 
revived speculation in the newspapers there about special measures that might be token by the Irish Government. Mr Lynch’s policies towards Northern Ireland will be discussed at his party’s annual conference beginning today. 
WIDGERY TRIBUNAL 
3. A preliminary hearing of the Tribunal was held at Coleraine on 14 February. Lord Widgery announced the arrangements for further hearings which would begin on 21 February. During his address Lord Widgery said that the limits of the enquiry in space were the streets of Londonderry in which the disturbances and shootings took place, and in time the period beginning with the moment when the march became involved in violence and ending with the conclusion of the affair and the deaths. 
4. Mr. Hume UP (SDLP) has said since the hearing that no-one in Londonderry should 
participate in the enquiry. He said the people did not accept that it was impartial, and its terms of reference meant that it could not investigate any political or military decisions taken before 30 January. 
5. 6. During discussion of the Business of the House of Commons at Westminster on 
17 February Mr Fitt claimed that Lord Widgery had interpreted his terms of reference more narrowly than they had been described to the House by the Government. 
Representatives of the families of the people killed in Londonderry on 
30 January have said they will not participate in the enquiry, but seven priests who claim to have witnessed the shooting have said they will give evidence, subject to certain unspecified conditions. 
POLITICAL REFORMS 7. 
With speculation in the newspapers about possible political reforms in Northern 
Ireland continuing, the only public reactions in Northern Ireland have been those of Miss Devlin MP, who commented dismissively on the idea of representatives of the minority accepting a place in the Northern Ireland Government, and Mr Craig UP, who has described the various proposals as a recipe for civil war. 
8. In a speech on 10 February Mr Faulkner said that his Government’s Green Paper 
on possible reforms was a basis for discussion, and the Government was more than willing to consider suggestions for modification providing they were realistic.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 80 18 
FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours The period was comparatively uneventful, with no casualties 
among the security forces. Seven civilians suffered minor injuries when a bomb exploded in the reception office of British Caledonian Airways’ premises near the city centre in Belfast. There were also two other exp l o s ions in the city, in a provision store and in a parked oar. 2. 
There were six shooting incidents in Londonderry, five in Belfast 
and three elsewhere. One of the latter occurred when three armed men attempted to rob a van in Lurgan; the RUC, acting on information from a local resident, closed in on the men and were obliged to oven fire, wounding one of the bandits. All three men were arrested and two loaded pistols in their possession were recovered. 3. 
There were fifteen arrests of wanted persons, who included the 
OC and the training officer of B Company of the Provisional IRA in Andersonstown. Immediate questioning of the arrested men led to a carbine being found in a culvert in the area. Murder of thomas. Callaghan 4. 
The murder of Mr. Callaghan, the bus driver and UDR member, in 
Londonderry on 16 February has been condemned by Mr. John Hume, by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Londonderry and by the seven priests who were involved in the events of 30 January. As a protest against the murder, about 200 workers of both denominations stayed away from work yesterday, and a small number of them paraded outside the RUC headquarters in the city. A larger number of Protestants, members of the Loyalist Association, walked to the gates of Ebrington Barracks where four spokesmen saw the CO of 1 Royal Anglian and expressed revulsion at the murder, while at the same time demanding more vigorous action by the security forces to control Londonderry.

THERE IS AN INHERENT RISK THAT ANY INTERNEE RELEASED AS A POLITICAL GESTURE WILL RETURN TO HIS PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND, REPAIRING THE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE WHICH HAS BEEN INFLICTED ON BOTH FACTIONS OF THE IRA SINCE 9 AUG 71. 3. THE PRIME TARGETS FOR RETALIATORY ACTION BY INTERNEES AFTER RELEASE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY THE MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL BRANCH OF THE PUC: THESE ARE FOR THE MOST PART KNOWN TO THOSE INTERNES WHOM THEY HAVE ARRESTED OR INTERROGATED. INTHE PAST THE RISK TO SPECIAL BRANCH HAS BEEN REDUCED BY REQUIRING RELEASED INTERNEES TO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO A FORM OF OATH, AFFIRMATION OR UNDERTAKING TO ABSTAIN FROM ALL FORMS OF MILITANT ACTIVITY. SOME SIMILAR UNDERTAKING IS ESSENTIAL FOR ANY FUTURE RELEASES. 4. IN ANY PROGRAMME OF RELEASE FOR POLITICAL REASONS THE IRA WILL CERTAINLY REGARD THE MEASURE AS PROOF OF THEIR OWN SUCCESS. IT MAY ALSO BE SO REGARDED BY MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE EFFECT OF THESE TWO FACTORS COULD WELL BE TO INCREASE IRA RESISTANCE TO INTERROGATION AND AT THE SAME TIME TO WEAKEN THE DETERMINATION OF MEMBERS OF THE BRANCH TO PURSUE INTERROGATION TO SUCCESS. IT COULD ALSO SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE RECRUITMENT AND RUNNING OF AGENTS. IT SEEMS INEVITABLE, THEREFORE, THAT INTELLIGENCE PROCUREMENT WILL SUFFER. 5. ANY ATTEMPT TO LINK A PROGRAMME OF RELEASES WITH AN UNDERTAKING NOT TO MAKE FURTHER ARRESTS WOULD BE REGARDED BY THE IRA AS A STILL GREATER SUCCESS AND THEY MUST BE EXPECTED TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOUP THEIR LOSSES AND TO EQUIP THEMSELVES TO INTENSIFY OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCE AT A DATE OF THEIR OWN CHOOSING. TO RESTRICT ARRESTS FOR DETENTION TO LEADING IRA MEMBERS ONLY MAY BE POSSIBLE IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE SECURITY FORCES ALREADY DOMINATE THE TWO IRA FACTIONS BUT SUCH A DECISION WOULD INHIBIT SECURITY FORCE ACTION IN AREAS WHERE THE IRA IS STILL OPERATING EFFECTIVELY. EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO 9 AUG 71 MADE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT POLICE QUESTIONING WITHOUT THE SANCTION OF DETENTION OF INTERNMENT IS TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE AS AN INTELLIGENCE WEAPON IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THOSE ARRESTED HAVE BEEN WELL BRIEFED ON THEIR RIGHTS. IRA RECRUITING WILL BENEFIT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RELUCTANCE TO JOIN OF THOSE WHO FEAR INTERNMENT IS OVERCOME, AND THOSE ON THE RUN WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO RETURN: THERE ARE ABOUT 140 SUCH PEOPLE OPERATING FROM SOUTH OF THE BODER. 6. THE SEGREGATION AND REHABILITATION OF SELECTED INTERNEES AS A PRELIMINARY TO THEIR RELEASE CAN HOWEVER BE TAKEN WITHOUT THESE DISADVANTAGES. 7. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT, IN SPITE OF CAREFUL EXAMINATION, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE IN PRESENT CONDITIONS (EG INTIMIDATION) TO BRING PRESENT INTERNEES TO TRIAL. CONCLUSIONS 8. ALL INTERNEES ARE MEMBERS OF THE IRA AND THEIR PREMAT

1. MY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING TELEGRAM CONTAINS THE TEXT OF A PAPER ON THE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF THE RELEASE OF INTERNEES TABLED AT THE JOINT SECURITY COMMITTEE MEETING THISMORNING. DISCUSSION WAS BRIEF. GENERAL TUZO SAID THAT THE PAPER SIMPLY REPRESENTED THE VIEWS OF THE ARMY AND THE RUC ON THE SECURITY ASPECT. HE RECOGNISED THAT ITS ARGUMENT HAD TO BE BALANCED BY THE ARGUMENT THAT SOME RELEASE OF INTERNEES MIGHT HELP TO ATTRACT CATHOLIC OPINION AWAY FROM THE IRA. THE CHIEF CONSTABLE AND THE HEAD OF SPECIAL BRANCH EMPHASISED THE IMPORTANCE OF TIMING AND OF NOT DOING ANYTHING TO RAISE THE MORALE OF THE INTERNEES. MR FAULKNER REFERRED TO THE BELIEF IN CATHOLIC CIRCLES (INCLUDING CATHOLIC MEMBERS OF THE POLICE AUTHORITY WHO HAD SEEN HIM) THAT SOME OF THOSE INTERNED WERE NOT MEMBERS OF THE IRA, A BELIEF WHICH WAS CONTRADICTED BY PARA. 2 OF THE PAPER. HE WONDERED WHETHER IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO DEVISE A PROGRAMME FOR RELEASE OF INTERNEES WHICH COULD BE STARTED ONCE VIOLENCE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL. I DID NOT OFFER ANY COMMENT ON THE PAPER. THE MEETING TOOK NOTE OF IT. 2. MY VIEW IS THAT THE PAPER SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUT TO THE JSC AND THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER NOT TO PRODUCE A PAPER JOINTLY WITH THE RUC. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE ARMY ARE WELL ENOUGH AWARE OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE SPECIAL BRANCH AND OF THE PROBLEMS FACING THEM TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THEIR INTEREST TO WHITEHALL WITHOUT IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES WITH SPECIAL BRANCH POSITIONS IN A JOINT PAPER. 3. THE DISCUSSION IN JSC MOVED ON TO A SUGGESTION BY BLOOMFIELD THAT THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC STATEMENT WHICH WOULD BE DESIGNED TO CLEAR UP SOME MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT INTERNMENT EG THE LEGAL BASIS FOR IT AND THE RIGHT OF INTERNEES TO SECURE LEGAL ADVICE IN PRESENTING THEMSELVES TO JUDGE BROWN’S COMMITTEE. IT APPEARED TO BE THE THOUGHT OF SOME PRESENT AT THE MEETING THAT SUCH A PAPER WOULD ALSO MAKE CLEAR THAT ONLY IRA MEMBERS WERE INTERNED. MR FAULKNER SAID THAT HE WAS SURE THAT UK MINISTERS WOULD LIKE SOMETHING TO BE PUT OUT. HE SUGGESTED THAT THE STATEMENT SHOULD ISSUE FROM THE JSC, AND ASKED THAT A DRAFT SHOULD BE READY WITHIN 48 HOURS. I QUESTIONED WHETHER IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR SUCH A STATEMENT TO ISSUE FROM THE JSC AND SAID THAT IN THAT CASE I WOULD HAVE TO ASK FOR TIME TO REFER IT TO LONDON. MR FAULKNER SAID THAT SINCE THAT WOULD CAUSE DELAY HE WOULD DROP HIS SUGGESTION THAT IT SHOULD BE A JSC STATEMENT. 4. AFTER THE MEETING I SPOKE TO BLOOMFIELD AND POINTED OUT THAT EVEN THOUGH THE STATEMENT ISSUED FROM THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT THE SUBJECT OF INTERNMENT WAS SO SENSITIVE THAT QUESTIONS MIGHT WELL BE DIRECTED TO HMG IN PARLIAMENT, ESPECIALLY IF THE STATEMENT DEALT WITH MATTERS SUCH AS THE IRA STATUS OF ALL INTERNEES AND THE OPERATION OF JUDGE BROWN’S COMMITTEE. HE READILY TOOK THE POINT THAT THE DRAFTING WOULD NEED TO BE DONE CAREFULLY. 5. SEE M.I.F.\T. SMITH

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 79 FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours After a fairly quiet day, there were a number of shooting 
incidents during the evening in which two members of the security forces were killed and there were various other casualties. 2. A soldier in the RAPC, attached to 3 RRF, was fatally wounded when two Any land rovers travelling along the M1 motorway from Lurgan to Lisburn came under fire 
- probably from a motorway bridge. 
As well as gunfire there were two minor explosions just near the vehicles, presumably as bombs were thrown at them in an attempt to force them off the road. The drivers accelerated away to escape the fire 
- making it impossible for the other soldiers in the 
vehicles to return it. 3. 
Also during the early evening, a member of 5 UDR (Thomas 
Callaghan) who was employed as a bus driver in Londonderry was abducted at gunpoint from his vehicle while he was driving it in the Creggan area. His body was later found, hooded and bound, having apparently been thrust from a car; he had been shot dead. 4. 
a soldier was slightly wounded while patrolling in the New Lodge area. He was a member of 2 Parachute Regiment, which had only just arrived in Northern Ireland. It is frequently the case that units suffer a majority of their casualties within the first few weeks of their tour of duty in Northern Ireland, while exertise is still building up. 5. 
In Belfast there were five shooting incidents. In one of them, Elsewhere in Belfast, in the Markets area, a man was shot twice 
from a passing car and was seriously wounded. It is believed that he had previously been threatened for having carried on working on Disruption Day (9 February). In a shooting incident in Londonderry a gunman was seen to be hit when the Army fired; he was dragged

You mentioned to me that the Prime Minister wished to 
classification of all the internees into three categories. Those in the category Of least danger- which contains roughly 
25 percent (or 150) of the present internees - are mostly those who actually throw the bombs and fire the rifles. They 
are all IRA men; and their release carries the risk that they would go straight back to their previous activities, with an 
detention.

Nevertheless the Army would accept in principle - 
that the political initiative was not followed by a major set back, (It would be greatly preferable to wait until those in the category of least danger had been physically separated from the others, and had experienced at least a short period away from the hardore category, before starting to release them).

As regards new internments, we would be totally opposed to calling a complete halt, while being prepared to see greater 
selectivity. We quite apreciate that the political impact 
would be greater if it could be announced that, along with accelerating the release of those already interned, there would be no further internment orders: but there are important security reasons for not doing this. The morale and operational effectiveness of the IRA, and hence their level of intimidation, 
would inevitably rise the moment they knew that arrests under the Special Powers Act had stopped. It has to be remembered that the substantial progress which has been made in Belfast, 
to be pursued with such vigour, that the number of effective terrorists remaining at large within the city can be gauged.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 78 16 FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours Five civilians received gunshot wounds in Belfast during the 
evening, in shooting incidents in which the security forces were not directly involved. Two of then were apparently shot from passing cars, one in Short strand on the edge of Ballymacarrett, and the other in Grosvenor Road just off the Falls. Later in the evening shots were heard in the Ardoyne and troops who ent to investigate found two men, both blindfolded, with gunshot wounds in the thigh. Onlookers said that a third man had also been shot but had run off he has since been identified as a wanted person. It is quite clear that all these attacks were made by the IRA and that, although the usual claim was made that the IRA was simply dealing with people who had offended against their own code of conduct by stealing, they were in fact cases of the IRA intimidating or taking vengeance against informers. A placard found beside the two men in the Ardoyne bore the legend "thieves and touts beware" - normally 
"tout" being the term used for an informer. One of the wounded men (John 
Docherty) had in fact given some help to the Army. 2. 
In Lurgan a youth was seized by two armed men who tarred and 
feathered him and left him tied to the gate of his home near Portadown. 3. 
Altogether there were eight shooting incidents in Belfast and three in Londonderry - without any casualties to the forces. The 
day’s quota of rioting in Londonderry included both the usual hooliganism in the area of William Street and Little Diamond, and some stoning of the posts at Rosemount and Blighs Lane. 4. 
On the border there was an exlosion at the Customs Post at 
Aghalane, Co. Fermanagh, and a patrol going to investigate it was fired on by a gunman from across the border. The fire was returned but there appeared to be no casualties. The Gardai were contacted

16 February, 1972 As you know, the Embassy in Dublin is still 
having to improvise. We have received a letter from Sir John Peck dated 14 February containing a number of points which might, in easier circumstances, have been sent by telegram and received a wider distribution. It seems worth recapitulating these. 
SDLP Talks "Talks between the Irish Government and the 
SDLP went badly and there was no meeting of minds. The Irish Government would, I think, almost certainly settle or a coalition Government in Stormont including non-Unionists, 
and talks about phasing out internment. They regard Fitt’s ’no talks until internment ends’ as unrealistic, and believe that the SDLP would no longer accept a Stormont Government but will insist upon rule by commission. 
Reunification "Reunification has only come to the fore because 
every other road ahead seems to be blocked, and the Irish Government would certainly not regard it as a live issue. 
Political Initiative "It is universally assumed that The Sunday Times 
publicity about the ’political initiative’ was an inspired leak and there is something in the wind. As a result of Londonderry and the burning of the Embassy, Jack Lynch, contrary to hopes and expectations, is likely to have a very rough time at the party conference which starts on Friday, 18 February. He will do his best to damp down the post-Derry fury and endeavour to be constructive. If there were any pointer that he could be given to our thinking on the North it is important that he should have it, and before Friday. I have made it clear that in my opinion it seemed unlikely that we should have anything, but please note that the bid is there.

to the Ministry of Defence my warm thanks to all who arranged 
my flight at such short notice. 2. 
You might be interested to know how the day finished. I 
took off from Northolt in the H.S.125 at 4 p.m. with the crew in civilian clothes, and landed in the filthiest weather imaginable at Baldonnel military airfield. The crew were enthusiastic about the cooperation of the Irish air traffic control, who gave us absolute priority over everything that was in the air. 
I was 
greeted by Colonel Swann, the head of the little Irish Air Force, who took me straight into his office, as McCann, Denis Greenhill’s opposite number, wanted me to ring him. 
I did, and he told me 
that the Embassy was in flames, there were 30,000 people on the rampage in the area, and would I please avoid the centre of the city at all costs. 
Two car loads of my Special Branch detectives 
were at the airfield, from which it is only 30 minutes across country to Glencairn, and I walked in on the stroke of 6, as I had told my wife I would. The grounds were swarming with uniform and plain clothes police.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 77 15 FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours There were five large explosions in Belfast which,.together 
with the fires which resulted, caused extensive damage to industrial premises in several areas of the city. 
A sixth bomb was defused, 
and another was deliberately exploded by the bomb disposal squad, without damage. 2. 
Belfast and Londonderry each had five shooting incidents. In 
Andersonstown a RUC constable was slightly wounded; there were no casualties in londonderry. The daily quota of hooliganism took place in Londonderry, with five nail bombs being thrown. 3. 
There was a further theft of a rifle from the home of a UDR 
soldier, this time in the Stewartstown area of Co. Tyrone. At about the same time two armed men attempted to break into the house of another UDR soldier in the same area, but they were put to flight by the three occupants of the house, leaving behind them a Thompson submachinegun and a full magazine. In Belfast a tip-off led to three shotguns and two .22 rifles being found in the Ligoniel area. 4. 
The body of the man found on Sunday, on the border near Newtown- 
butler, was identified as that of a soldier, Private McCann. He had been serving at an ordnance depot in Northern Ireland at his own request, in order to be able to visit his mother in Dublin when she was ill. He had been on authorised leave in Dublin at the time of his death. The manner in which he had been left points clearly to an IRA murder. His death brings the number of British soldiers killed in Northern Ireland since the beginning of 1971 to fifty, excluding 6 members of the UDR. 5. 
There were 24 arrests of wanted persons durin the period.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 76 14. FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the 1ast 72 hours It was a comparatively uneventful weekend. In all there were 
25 shooting incidents and fourteen explosions during the period but they were for the most part free of serious consequences. 2. 
There were a few minor casualties among the security forces. On 
Friday night in the Antrim Road area of Belfast two armed men attempted to attack a member of the UDR returning to his home: a pistol aimed at him failed to fire, and he was hit over the head, but a guard from a nearby TA Centre came to his assistance. On Saturday a soldier was slightly wounded while on patrol in the Falls; and on Sunday a soldier received gunshot wounds during an exchange of fire between a patrol and gunmen in Lurgan. 3. 
In Londonderry on Saturday, while a wedding reception was being 
held at a hotel, three armed men planted a 30 lb bomb in the building. A youth who was acting as best man at the wedding attempted to tackle the gunmen and was shot in the head and seriously wounded. This was the only major incident to occur in Londonderry, though there was frequent hooliganism in the usual area of William Street/Little Diamond on all three days 
- eleven nail bombs being thrown on 
Saturday alone. 4. 
There were two successful ambuhes by the security forces during 
tho weekend. On Friday night, near Enniskillen, four men who were making their escape after blowing up the house of a council official ran into a military ambush and were found to have two revolvers in their car. They admitted the bomb attack and claimed to be acting as mercenaries of the IRA, operating from the Republic. On Sunday evening on the north-west edge of Belfast, following atip-off, an ambush was laid near a mill in Ligoniel, and two out of a party of three men who attempted to bomb 
building were shot and captured.

The Rt Hon Reginald Maudling MP Home Office Whitehall SWIA 2AP 
14 February 1972 
You should know that a handful of firms have approached us in recent months seeking assistance under the Local Employment Acts for projects which involve moving production from Northern Ireland to the development areas of Great Britain. 
Clearly we should not appear to be encouraging firms to switch employment from Northern Ireland to the assisted areas, particularly in present circumstances. Accordingly we propose, in considering projects for assistance, to take account of consequential losses of jobs in Northern Ireland on the same basic as losses in the development and intermediate areas of Great Britain. In practice this will mean that we shall refuse assistance whore the employment arising from a project is wholly offset by a consequential lose of jobs in Northern Ireland; and where the employment loss in Northern Ireland is smaller than the gain in Great Britain, we shall give assistance only in respect of the net additional jobs to be provided. 
If afirm which is rducing its employment inNorthern Ireland seeks our help in finding a suitable site in Great Britain I do not think we could reasonably refuse to give the normal information and advice. But we shall emphasise that no assistance is available in respect of employment transferred from Northern Ireland and in our general efforts to influence firms’ location decisions we shall of course continue to make every effort to maintain and increase employment in the Province. 
I do not consider it necessary to announce these arrangements. My officials will, however, keep in touch with yours on the general 
question and wherever possible we shall notify the Ministry of Commerce about individual cases as they arise. 
I am copying this letter to Tony Barber, Robert Carr and Peter Walker.

Northern Ireland The most convenient way of dealing with the memorandum might be 
to base the discussion on the Summary in paragraph 34 and to group the questions for decision under three headings - the substance of the plan; tactics and procedure; and timing of initial action. The Substance of the Plan 
The Plebiscites 2. 
Two questions arise here:(a) 
Is the question (set out in paragraph 2(iii)) correctly phrased? First, it has no reference to the time at which Northern Ireland might leave the United Kingdom: ought it to read ’Are you in favour of Northern Ireland leaving the United Kingdom now’? Second, should the question be directed to departure from the United Kingdom or specifically to the reunification of Ireland? Those who advocated a unilateral declaration of independence would answer "yes" to the question as proposed. 
(b) What significance is there in the suggestion that entitlement to vote in the referendum should be based on entitlement to vote for an election to the Westminster, as opposed to the Stormont, Parliament? Will this occasion Unionist suspicions? 
Changes in the Northern Ireland Parliament 3. 
These paragraphs are all pretty clear. But are Ministers prepared 
to face the possible implications at Westminster of the introduction of P. R. in Northern Ireland? Community Government 4. 
The main question here is whether a Community Government based 
on proportionate representation in the Cabinet of the Parties in Parliament achieves satisfactorily the object of giving "the minority" a full role in Central Government. The tendency of the scheme proposed (particularly when election by P. R. is added) will be to fragment the Parties. Under the numerical allocation of portfolios 2 Parties, each numbering not less than 4 Members, will take one portfolio each, whereas one Party of 8 members will have only one post. But how will the resultant number of "Ministers" match the number of Ministerial posts? Will they be too many or too few? And, if several new Parties suddenly come into existence, will the Government have to be enlarged to accommodate their "Ministers"?

February 14 1972. My dear Prime Minister, 
hesitant in taking up any of your time but hope you will not mind my sending you these points on Ireland in view of our conversation of a few weeks ago. I know that you will be receiving advice from any sources, such of it better informed than mine, but hope this may be of some small help. 
Knowing how many problem you are dealing with I as 
1) Although londonderry has made the situation much more difficult I believe that the principal point which emerged from our discussion, namely that the Catholic minority is not irremediably alienated from the United Kingdom connection remains valid. Policy can thus continue to be based on the two bases : 
1. No separation from the U.K. without the consent of the sajority. 2. A new deal for the minority by offering full participation in the life of the province, both political and economic. 
2) Even if any new offer fails, it will have been worth doing, as opinion both at home and overseas requires or expects the government to take an initiative. This is not the situation "something must be done" which usually means that the wrong thing is done if the mood is heeded, but one where there is recognition that responsibility and power lies with the U.K. government. 
The government here will be in a stronger position 
in relation to N.I. if a reasonable offer is made and rejected, and not in a weaker one. 
3) I believe that talks with the Opposition in this situation are very worthwhile. They will spread the responsibility. Furthermore it is in the government’s interest to preserve the bi-partisan policy much more of which remaind in existene than the press allows. Its notable that Harold Wilson has not pressed for the end of internment immediately. Labour has it own difficulties over N.I. since the left wing while hating Ulster Unionists also detests the Catholic Church. 
A final point is 
that the government will look silly if while exhorting the Catholic parties in N.I. to come together it cannot itself talk to the Opposition. I quite agree in principle about the Privy Council limitation but one could get the same safeguard by confining talks to front-benchers e.g. Merlyn Bees instead of Kevin Macamara, or deputing certain security matters to privy councillors. 
4) Over the last few days and the weekend I have been taking soundings in Northern Ireland re the position of the Opposition parties, the Civil Rights Movement, and the I.R.A. The fo lowing picture emerges of their wishes : 1. They want the end of imprisonment without trial. I take this to mean that they do not want immediate release of all internees but want them to be brought to trial. 2. 3. 
They want Stormont to be suspended. 
to govern 4. 
5. 
They would like to see a commission appointed acceptable to the minority the province in the interim. 
They would like what they call "a count down" for a United Ireland. They would like quadripartite talks between the S.D.L.P. /the Ulster 
Unionists / the Irish Republic / the United Kingdom under a neutral chairman such as a European lawyer.

Ref. A01234 Northern Ireland At the last meeting of Ministers, officials were asked to give further 
consideration to:(1) 
(2) The nature and content of a possible political initiative. 
The modalities of launching and implementing it. The attached memorandum has been prepared in discharge of this 
remit, as a basis for further discussion by Ministers (none of whom is, of course, committed to it at this stage). 
Its circulation should presumably 
be limited to those Ministers who were present at the last meeting; and I am therefore sending copies of this minute and the memorandum to the Home Secretary, the Lord President and the Secretary of State for Defence, but to nobody else. 
I hope that it will be possible to arrange a meeting fairly 
early next week, at which decisions could be taken on the issues summarised in paragraph 34.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 75 11 FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours Activity was relatively low in Belfast and Londonderry, 
rather more intensive in the border and rural areas. 2. 
but Two soldiers of 1 Devon & Dorset were killed, and two slightly 
injured, when a land rover which was heading a patrol going from Newtownhamilton to Crossmaglen detonated a mine on the road at Cullyhanna. Earlier in the day, a patrol 
- acting on a tip-off to the RUC - found five mines further along the border. south-est of 
Keady. One of them comprised twenty pounds of gelignite and the other four contained about three pounds each: wires for detonating them led across the border a few metres away, in the same way as with the mine which killed a soldier of 1D & D on 21 January. The wires were cut and the mines defused. 3. 
There was one case of cross-border shooting, hen a patrol at 
Belleek, Co. Fermanagh came under fire from the Republic and returned one shot. There were no casualties. Elsewhere on the border Mr. Frank McManus MP, who had earlier driven into the Republic, was stopped at a UDR road block on his return, after refusing to allow the RUC to search him was arrested. 4. 
Apart from the mine at Cullyhanna, there were four other 
explosions in rural areas, and also one in the middle of Belfast which damaged a large store and started a fire which destroyed a building. 5. 
There were five shooting incidents in Belfast, three of them i 
the Ardoyne and two in the Lower Falls. One gunman is thought to have been hit. In another of the incidents, when shots were fired from the Divis Flats at a patrol 
woman bystander was hit by a ricochet. 6.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 74 10 FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours "Disruption Day" passed fairly quietly, and certainly did not 
give rise to any exceptional level of disturbance. There was fairly widespread absenteeism from factories and schools, but little effect on business - though shops in Londonderry closed in the afternoon. No significant disruption of public services was achieved. In rural areas there were some attempts to blck roads, mainly in the area of Maghera and Dungiven in Co. Londonderry; the roads were clear for traffic again within a few hours. SDLP and ICRA appear to have been in some disarray about the form which protest demonstrations in Londonderry should take. 2. 
Hooligan activity in the William Street area of Londonderry 
was of the customary kind, though involving rather larger gangs than usual. Six nail bombs were thrown at the troops, causing no casualties. Blast bomb were also thrown twice in Belfast and twice in Strabane, also without casualties. However, an officer and a soldier were seriously injured when an armoured vehicle (Pig) which was engaged in clearing a road barrier at Coalisland was blasted by a bomb. 3. 
There were 17 explosions altogether, including two others in 
Belfast, one in a telephone exchange near Newry, and one in a house in Lurgan. 4. 
There were eleven shooting incidents, nine of them in Belfast- 
in one of which a policeman was slightly wounded. In another, a man (John Cunningham) who fired a sub machine gun at an RUC patrol and then tried to run away, with some companions, was hit and seriously wounded when the police returned the fire. In Ballymurphy a youth fired three pistol shots at soldiers, who returned the fire; he was seen to be hit, but was quickly surrounded by the usual crowd. Later

10th February, 1972. You sent Robert Andrew a copy of your letter 
of 9th February to Peter Gregson about Mr. Chichester-Clark’s suggestion that an adjournment debate might be directed to the shortcomings of the Irish Republic. 
We did not think much of this idea when it was 
first mooted for the sort of reasons you imply, and like you we think even less of it now. 
Peter Gregson, Graham Angel and Leonard Davies. I am sending copies of this letter to We therefore 
agree that Mr. Chichester-Clark should be discouraged from pursuing it.

Wednesday 9 February 1972 NORTHERN IRELAND 
- SEEKING THE NEXT STEP by George Holt LPS Political Correspondent Authoritative sources in London gave no (repeat no) credence tonight 
Wednesday to a report accredited to the London Correspondent of the Washington Post and appearing today in the British newspaper, The Guardian, that the British Government has tentatively decided on a three-pronged plan to relieve the conflict in Northern Ireland. 
The Washington Post’s correspondent’s story indicated that there were 
three key elements in such a plan: a) A relaxation of the internment policy b) Massive economic aid to reduce unemployment c) Some form of community government 
It added that best informed sources expected a favourable decision 
probably to be announced next week. This is not (repeat not) the position. 
The Government in London does 
indeed seek the earliest possible opportunity for a constructive initiative. It is undoubtedly true that Ministers have been giving the most urgent consideration to the Northern Ireland situation in the light of what happened recently both in Londonderry and in Newry. (repeat not) yet led them to basic decisions. 
on the first major question to be answered - namely, whether the present situation does indeed provide the opportunity for initiative. 
But their deliberations have not They have yet to make judgment 
Nor have they 
yet taken decisions on the shape of any initiatives, for the right moment whenever finally they may judge that to be. This is, moreover, a situation which might yet continue for some time. 
Meanwhile, as Ministers pursue this extremely difficult process of 
assessing the situation it is the merest speculation to indulge in discussion of the steps which might eventually be taken. It is also clear in London tonight that British Ministers are anxious that 
when any initiative is possible it will be launched in an atmosphere and at a time which augurs adequate response from all the parties involved. 
In this 
respect the Government has for long been mindful of the failure of previous initiatives because of this lack of response. 
One has in mind the Northern 
Ireland Government’s Consultative Document on the Future Development of the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland, which it published last October and on which it has been impossible to get proper discussion in the light of the situation which has since existed.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 73 9 
FEBRUARY 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours By recent standards there were not a great many incidents. There 
were a dozen shooting incidents altogether, including eight in Belfast. In one of these, a man named Bernard Rice - a member of the Catholic Ex-Servicemen’s Association 
- was shot dead from a passing car. The 
reason for this murder is not at present clear; speculation ranges from Protestant backlash to rivalry betwen the supporters of the Glaspow football teams, Celtic and Rangers (ice being a angers supporter). 2. 
There were three shooting incidents in Londonderry; and, in rural 
areas, patrols of UDR twice came under sire. There no casualties at all. 3. 
There were also about a dozen bombing incidents in all. 
Explosions caused major damage to a car salesroom in Belfast, a garage just outside Londonderry, the telephone exchange at Benburb, Co. Armagh and a bridge at Forkill. A vehicle was blown up in Newry; and near Portadown a fire burned down the garage of a Customs official. 4. 
Two soldiers sustained injuries in the Ardoyne when a claymore- 
type mine exploded. Other patrols in Belfast had blast-bombs thrown at them on two occasions, but no harm was done. 5. 
There were two minor finds of arms in the area of Armagh which 
included a rifle fond in the car park of a Catholic church. Disruption Day, 9 February 6. 
One cannot predict exactly what form the demonstrations will take 
to mark the expiry of six months since the introduction of internment. The likely possibilities are: a. 
Blocking of trunk roads and minor roads into Belfast; 
b. Picketing of police stations and Army posts;

You asked me :-

Philip Woodfield did see some of the statements which were prepared in the early stages in early September when he want to Northern Ireland on a visit. 
there is no regular arrangement whereby the UK Goverment is given this information. 
On (ii) there are two aspects :- 
(a) Mr. Faulkner’s criteria for signing an internment order; 
(b) Judge Brown’s criteria for release. 
These were announced in Mr. Faulkner’s statement on l5 September when he made the first 219 internment orders. 
The passage dealing with (a) is as follows :- 
"I have made no interment order without being satisfied on evidence placed before me that the person concerned was and still is an active member of the official or provisional ting of the IRA or has been closely implicated in the recent IRA campaign." 
The passage relevant to (b) is as follows :- 
"The Special Powers Regulations provide for the setting up of an Advisory Committee to consider representations from internees. 
His Honour 
Judge Brown nas agreed to act as Chairman of this Committee 
............ The Committee’s 
main function will be to assess whether or when the internee’s release can be safely permitted and, where appropriate, the Committee will consider whether or not they can accept any undertaking on his part that he will not engage in violence on his release."

Northern Ireland: Statement by the Home Secretary The Home Secretary does not say when or in what circumstances he 
proposes to make his statement and this is one of the issues which will have to be considered. But the/question for consideration is whether the policy implicit in the statement would command the support of the Cabinet and stand a reasonable chance of acceptance in Northern Ireland. 2. 
propositions:(a) Periodical plebiscites on the Border, the first being held at the 
outset, the second 15 years later and others at successive ten-yearly intervals. (b) The reform of the Northern Ireland Parliament, probably on a 
PR basis. (c) A guarantee of minority representation in the central Government, 
local government and all the organs of administration. The Home Secretary seems 
representation would be on a proportionate basis. (d) 
- though this is not entirely clear - to envisage that Responsibility for law and order to remain vested in "the elected 
authorities in the area subject to the overruling authority of HMG". This is not entirely clear and is in any case not wholly accurate. There is no question of any "overruling authority of HMG" in Great Britain 
The essence of the proposed policy seems to consist of the following - except in 
so far as the Exchequer finances police authorities in part and the central Government have power to make general regulations. The point is of some importance since, if the Home Secretary is thinking in terms of some overriding executive authority by Westminster, he cannot argue that this would follow normal practice in Great Britain; it would in fact be exceptional. (e) A period of transition before the new arrangements in (b)-(d) 
above come into force. During this period the administration of the Province would be vested in "a Commission responsible to the Government at Westminster". (d) A modification of internment in order that it may be progressively 
phased out.

Northern Ireland After Ministers have discussed, this afternoon, the preparations 
for dealing with tomorrow’s "anniversary of internment" march, they should perhaps consider:(a) The plans for coping with the Civil Rights march due to take place at Enniskillen on Sunday, 13th February. 
(b) The lessons to be learned from Newry in respect of tactical dispositions against marchers. At Newry the security forces appear to hate been successful both in avoiding provocation and in diverting the march from its original objective in the centre of the town. But they also seem to have been taken by surprise by a well-concealed change of plan on the part of the marchers; and, although all ended peacefully, a repetition of this tactic on another occasion might not have an equally peaceful outcome. 
Is there room for improvement in our intelligence about the demonstrators’ intentions? 
(c) The public relations aspect of these occasions. At Newry the tactical success of the security forces was obscured by an impression that NICRA scored points by holding an illegal march despite the ban; by demonstrating alienation from Government policy in such strength that the security forces were powerless to intervene; and by conducting the proceedings in a peaceful and disciplined way. This was a very one-sided presentation of the matter; and it did less than justice to the Army and the RUC, who are entitled to claim that the victory lay with them. Not least for the sake of their morale but also in the interests of the Government’s policy, we should do better than this in future.

HQ NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING General 1. 
during and after the illegal NICRA march on Sunday 30 January and its repercussions throughout the Province. 
The week has been dominated by the events in Londonderry Those took the form 
of widespread demonstrations, protest meetings, token strikes and closures, and intimidation as well as an upsurge in violence, particularly in Belfast. 
It has boon most noticeable that those areas of Belfast where the IRA. have been hardest hit - Ardoyne, New Lodge, Markets and 
place in those areas whore the IRA still has considerable influence and the power to intimidate 
West Belfast. 3. 
Conversely, the vast majority has taken - the Falls, West and South 
2. 
East Belfast, have played very little part in the reactions to the Londonderry shootings. 
In the early part of the week terrorist attacks continued and of bombs in parked stolen cars, particularly in Belfast. 
Bomb attacks continued with increasing use being made One 
assassination attempts were made on police officers and UDR members as well as sniping and ambush attacks on security force patrols and posts. 
policeman and one soldier have been killed during the week while nin regular soldiers, a UDR sldier and three policemen were wounded. A number of civilians have also been injured by terrorist bombs and gunfire. Arrest operations have continued. 
NICRA March - Sunday 30 January 4. 
The illegal NICRA. march in Londonderry on Sunday 30 January followed the prediction made before the event. 
The organisers, 
intent on defying the ban, led the marchers into direct confrontation with the Security Forces and lost control of the hooligan element. Arrest squads of 1 PARA, which were sent in to arrest the rioters, came under attack from IRA gunmen and bombers. In the exchanges of fire 13 people were killed and 15 wounded, 5 soldiers received minor injuries. 
5. The whole incident is now sub judice pending the investigation 
by the Widgery Tribunal. Propaganda 6. 
amongst Catholics in the North as well as moderates in the Republic. There were signs that the Irish Government might be steeling itself to curb IRA activities, particularly in border areas. NICRA marches had been poorly attended. 
By mid-January 1972 the IRA was in danger of losing support Several It was therefore vital 
for the IRA that Irish emotions should be aroused and commonsense set aside, if their campaign to achieve a united Ireland by force was to succeed.

14.00 Hours/5th February 1972. 
Extract from a speech by Mr. Norman ST. JOHNSTEVAS, M.P., (Chelmsford) at the Scottish Conference of the Federation of Conservative Students from Irish and Scottish Universities in Edinburgh, on Saturday, 5th February, 1972 
time. 
The situation in Northern Ireland is worsening all the Catholics are sunk in a mood of sullen despair. 
Protestant community is nearing flash-point. There is no 
figure in Ulster politics who commands enough respect of all sides to break the political deadlock. 
I am opposed to the 
intervention of the Church in politics in normal circumstances in Northern Ireland, but there is no normality in Ulster but an emergency. Northern Ireland has little political capital, but it does Has not the time come now to 
have great spiritual resources. 
draw upon them? I appeal to Cardinal Conway, to Archbishop Simms, the Primate 
of the Church of Ireland, and Dr. Haire, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church to use their prestige to help the suffering people of Northern Ireland. 
The Let them call a peace conference in 
Belfast, at which representatives of all the political interests involved could come together and talk. The conference whould be in private, held perhaps at the University of Belfast and presided over by a neutral chairman. 
The 
parties could hammer out a programme which would enable decent, lawabiding people, Catholic and Protestant, who constitute the vast majority of the people of the Province, to lead their lives in peace, 
which is all they wish to do. The Conservative Party is determined to defeat the gunmen in 
Northern Ireland, but it is equally determined to do all in its power to promote a just and lasting settlement which will respect the rights of both the Protestant and Catholic communities.

4 February, 1972 We have had from the Canadian High Commission a 
summary of the impressions gained by a Canadian diplomat from Ottawa who visited Dublin early this week and met senior officials concerned with Anglo-Irish relations. Given the difficulties attending normal Embassy reporting, I thought you might be interested. 
The Canadian’s impressions of Irish reactions were:(a) (b) (c) (d) 
frustration at their inability to convince Westminster of the need for structual change; 
a determination of "internationalise" the problem; 
an apparent willingness to intervene physically in Northern Ireland; 
a complete conviction that the troops in Derry had acted deliberately, and on the orders of the civil authorities, with the intent of bringing an end to street demonstrations and denying the minority their only means of expression; 
(e) 
a belief that a serious threat to the continued existence of the Lynch Government was posed by what is seen as a British decision in favour of harsh military measures. 
The Canadian apparently concluded by saying he could 
not over-emphasise the dominance of emotion over reason amongst those framing short-term policy.

PRIME MINISTER NEWRY MARCH SUNDAY 6th FEBRUARY 1972 I have examined the security force plans for frustrating 
the civil rights march due to be held at Newry on Sunday afternoon. I agree with them. 2. 
Estimates quoted in Irish newspapers are that 30,000 
Will attend. One report (given by telephone by Dr. O’Connell, a Member of the Irish Dail, to the Home Secretary) is that there are plans to launch 250,000 across the border- which is only 5 Miles away at the 
nearest point. There may be up to 
eight marches from neighbouring towns and from various housing estates on the edges of Newry, the plan apparently being to converse on Margaret Square in the town. 
The Provisional 
IRA are reliably reported to have tentative plans to infiltrate numbers of gunmen into Newry about 48 hours before the march. 3. 
17 vehicle checkpoints are to be established on the 
road approaches from 5 p.m. today, to check subversive From 1300 on Sunday 
elements entering the town./ They ill check all vehicles causing great inconvenience but greatly hampering the arrival of people in vehicles. 4. 
The marches, once under way, are to be stopped at barriers 
to be set up on Sunday. Around the central area of Newry there Will be 20 road blocks, manned by the RUC supported unobtrusively by the Army. The intention is that discussions

NORTHERN IRELAND -THE 
SCHEDULES FOR 6 FEB 72 General 1. 
Background Area a. 
NEWRY has a population of 11,750, 70% Catholic. The 
NEWRY area is traditionally a very Republican area. The canal and river in the centre of the town is completely impassable except at the bridges. 
b. 2. The long range weather forecast is that the weather 
will be changeable with rain at times, high winds but temperatures normal for this time of the year. 
The Intelligence Assessment a. 
Previous marches in NEWRY, whether Catholic or Protestant sponsored, have always caused tension. 
b. In the context of the march on 6 February, with Catholic feelings running high on both sides of the border, there is likely to be a very large attendance, certainly numbered in thousands. Estimates quoted in the Irish Press indicate that 30,000 are expected; Bernadette DEVLIN has said that civilians would outnumber soldiers by 125 to 1; and on 3 February 1972 Dr O’CONNELL, a Labour member of the Dail, telephoned the Home Secretary to say that he had heard from a reliable IRA source that there were plans to launch 250,000 men across the border. We can be certain that many thousands will in the event march, whether from the South or from within NEWRY itself or other places in the Province, and late on 3 February 1972 there were still NO reports of bookings of coaches in DUBLIN or DUNDALK. But this negative information must be balanced against the fact that 
a firm decision to hold the march was only announced at about 1800 hours on 3 February.

NORTHERN IRELAND In the light of reactions here to "Bloody Sunday" in 
Londonderry, we have been considering whether we ought not now to step up greatly our information effort in support of our Northern Ireland policy. 
2. As you know, we have felt in the past that our policies have received very fair treatment in the United States press and other information media, that the efforts of IrishAmerican activists to stir up US public opinion and to bring pressure on the US Administration to intervene wore not proving very successful despite the support obtained from Senators Kennedy and Ribicoff and the "Irish lobby" in the Congress. We felt too that too conspicuous propaganda efforts by us (eg the placing of advertisements in the US press or a visit by r Faulkner to the US) were liable to prove counterproductive and to stir up irredentist opposition which had been on the whole dormant. 
3. 
the point has now been reached when we consider that there is a danger of our losing the propaganda battle. The violence in Londonderry ras covered extensively and in gory detail by all of the television news broadcasts, mostly using BBC and ITN film. The result was to raise doubts in the minds of many more people about the wisdom of our policies in Northern Ireland and to increase the number of those who believe that British troops can no lonGer play an impartial role. Even before "Bloody Sunday" the steady drip of Irish-American propaganda Was beginning to have some effect. The pressure on Congressmen to identify themselves with the Irish-American cause and on the Administration to intervene in some way as growing. But after "Bloody Sunday" these pressures intensified and quickly led, for example, to the decision of the House Foreign Affairs Sub-committee to hold hearings on Northern Ireland beginning on 28 February. There is, we think, a real danger that, unless we step up our propaganda effort, the myth that Northern Ireland is another British Colonial war ill get firmly implanted in the American mind. The Irish Republican case is strengthened by the emotional support evoked here by the description of the Catholics as civil rights marchers and by the parallel drawn. between the partition of Ireland and the attempted secession 
Londonderry has changed the picture. I am afraid that

28 February 1972 Dear Donald, NORTHERN IRELAND Many thanks for your timely letter No N 1/5 of 16 February about 
our Information effort on Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister had commented, on seeing your telegram No.596, that urgent action was required to improve public understanding of our Northern Ireland policy in the United States 
2. Londonderry has, I agree, changed the picture for the worse, 
reinforcing the steady drip of Irish/American propaganda. You conclude, in fact, that your previous tactic of lying comparatively low ought now to be changed and that you should pursue a more positive and active role We must of course be governed by your judgement in this and we in no way seek to dispute it. On the contrary. What we are concerned with is how w can help you and whether at the moment there are any glaring hortoming in our performance. 
In examining this we must clearly avoid lumping together. (a) what we do by way of publicity work; and 
(b) what can be done to influence Congressional opinion and to keel the issue from playing a major role in the U.S. election campa I imagine that, whatever we do, Ulster will become an election issue as candidates chase the hardline Irish vote. This letter deals mainly with what the Information Departments (GIPD, IAD and IRD) can do in the realm of publicity in the broad sense. 
POLICY INITIATIVE 4. 
First it is obvious that both your and our task is much easier if we 
have something new and positive to sell and are not constrained to conduc an essentially defensive operation. So it goes without saying that we shall make the most in every way of any new initiative - which is indeed being actively considered by Ministers. And one of the things we shall particularly want to recommend when the initiative emerges will be Ministerial statements and interviews on TV and radio tape. Your suggest ion that the Prime Minister might send "a personal message of explanation to the President, in advance of a public announcement here, is one which I understand the Prime Minister already has in mind, but we do not at thi stage envisage any public response by the President; indeed, this would risk pushing the whole question further in the direction of it becoming an election issue. But such a personal message, unexploitable for publicity, might indeed encourage the public when the announcement is made. 
President to make helpful noises i

This week has been an eventful one from both political and 
operational points of view. 2. 
events during the week: 
a. The positive moves being taken against the IRA in Eire, partly because of the ineffectiveness of magistrates courts and partly as a result of the Aldershot explosion in which 5 women, a civilian and an RC Padre were killed and which drew universal condemnation. 
b. The change of 3 Stormont MPs to the Alliance Party; a move which for the first time, gives a non-sectarian party seats in Stormont. 
c. The attempt by John Hume, and others, to seriously restrict the Army’s powers of search and arrest without warrant. 
Although he succeeded in obtaining a favourable 
judgment in the Northern Ireland High Court, Westminster passed an anabling Bill within 7 hours to leave the Army’s powers unaltered. 
Operationally, there has been an increase in shooting 
incidents, almost entirely due to a major attempt to inflict casualties on Security Forces in Londonderry on 20 February. The bulk of terrorist activity has been in Belfast and Londonderry with the country areas relatively quiet except for a flurry of explosions on 18 February which coincided with attacks in the two cities.

NORTHERN IRELAND CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 86 
28 FEBRUARY 1972 Incidents in the last 72 hour The level of terrorist activity showed some reduction on 
that 
of the previous weekend, equated almost exactly with the average of the past three weeks in February. Altogether there were 39 shooting incidents, 13 explosions and six armed robberies. 2. 
The shooting incidents were spread fairly evenly over the three 
days, and between Belfast, Londonderry and other areas. They o course included the attack on r. John Taylor in Armagh on Friday, when nine bullets were fired at him and four hit him - as has already been fully reported in the Press. The only fatality was in Londonderry on Friday, where a youth died after being admitted to hospital with gunshot wounds: he had not been involved in an exchange of shooting with the security forces. There was one case of fire being exchanged across the border on Sunday; and on the same day there were several outbreaks of shooting in Dungannon in which the security forces were not involved. 3. 
Most of the explosions were fairly minor; but as a result of 
three explosions which occurred in Belfast on Friday, two policemen and several civilians received minor injuries. 4. 
There was a certain amount of the usual hooliganism in 
Londonderry on Friday and Saturday. There was also an outbreak of it at Newry on Saturday, when one soldier was slightly injured. in Belfast on Saturday a bus carrying Catholic football supporters was attacked by a band of about 100 Protestants and had to be escorted out of the area; this did not have the appearance of a premeditated attack by one community on the other. 5. 
There were fifteen arrests of wanted persons during the weekend, 
as well as 36 routine arrests. The wanted men who were picked up included the ’intelligence officer’ of the Andersonstown battalion of

During the weekend: the new compound at Long Kesh was brought into use; Category C internees were separated and moved into it; 
112 internees were moved to Long Kesh from MAIDSTONE and Magilligan. 
The distribution now (28 February) is: at Long Kesh: Category A and B internees, unsegregated: 458 (roughly in the ratio of l : 2) Category C internees, segregated 
: 153 611 
at Magilligan: Category B and C internees, unsegregated: 
in MAIDSTONE: mostly detainees, plusa few internees of all three Categories 
90 : Total internees and detainees Note During last week there were 13 new internment orders. 
There were also 13 releases (9 from Long Kesh, 4 from Magilligan). Thus, for the first time in many weeks, there was no net increase.

Northern Ireland: Timetable for Direct Rule The attached Note has been prepared as a basis for further 
discussion on Wednesday. It has not yet been circulated; but if you agree, I will send it out tomorrow. The meeting is restricted to the Home Secretary (with Sir Philip Allen), the Foreign Secretary, the Lord President and the Secretary of State for Defence. 
In the Foreign Secretary’s absence 
it would be helpful if Sir Denis Greenhill could be present; may I invite him? 
As regards the timetable itself, the Note comprises three possible 
schedules of action. There are obvious objections to all of them; and a great deal will turn on:(a) The time which we must allow for the passage of the Bill through Parliament - on which I hope to have a word with the Lord President tomorrow morning. 
(b) The degree of co-operation - or opposition - which we may expect to encounter from Mr. Faulkner and Stormont - on which it might 
be possible to form an opinion if you saw him before the Cabinet took their final decision (e.g. over next weekend) as distinct from seeing him subsequently in order to communicate that decision. 
(c) The extent to which we can, if necessary, rely on a short period of "Governor’s rule" while the legislation is being enacted 
- on 
which I hope that we shall get the lawyers’ view within the next 24 hours.

TO IMMEDIATE FCO TELEGRAM NO 105 OF 26 FEB, INFO IMMEDIATE UKREP BELFAST 
1. THE ARRESTS OF IRA MEMBERS IN THE REPUBLIC, COUPLED WITH THE ALDERSHOT AND ARMAGH OUTRAGES, CREATE A PROBLEM OF TIMING. 
THE TOUGH LINE AGAINST THE IRA AT THE FIANNA FAIL 
PARTY CONFERENCE BY THE TAOISEACH AND MINISTER OF JUSTICE ON 19/20 FEBRUARY WAS TAKEN ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT HMG WOULD SHORTLY BE ANNOUNCING PROPOSALS SUFFICIENTLY ATTRACTIVE TO MODERATE CATHOLIC OPINION NORTH AND SOUTH TO UNDERLINE THE POSITION OF THE IRA. 
THERE WAS AN ALMOST AUDIBLE GASP OF RELIEF IN DUBLIN 
WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE WAS NOT BEING DEFLECTED BY ALDERSHOT FROM HIS PLANNED COURSE. 
MEMBERS 
OF THE OFFICIAL SINN FEIN/IRA ARE BEING ROUNDED UP AND THE IRISH GOVERNMENT ARE BEING AS TOUGH AS THEY CAN WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF THE EXISTING LAW. 
2. THE SHOOTING OF MR TAYLOR HAS PRODUCED THE SAME SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED REACTION IN THE REPUBLIC AS ALDERSHOT. 
THERE 
ARE ALSO THE SAME FEARS THAT IT WILL DELAY THE PRESENTATION OF OUR NEW POLICY PROPOSALS. 
IT IS WIDELY RECOGNISED THAT THIS 
IS WHAT THE IRA ARE AIMING AT, AND IT WOULD BE A CONSIDERABLE VICTORY FOR THEM IF THEY SUCCEEDED. 
3. MEANWHILE THE THREE FIANNA FAIL DISSIDENTS, BUANEY, BRENNAN, AND FOLEY,HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL NO LONGER SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT IN ANY MATTER. 
IF THEY DECIDED 
TO VOTE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN ABSTAIN, THE OPPOSITION COULD HAVE A MAJORITY OF ONE. 
ON ANY PERMUTATION OF THE VOTES, 
ABSTENTIONS, AND ATTITUDES OF THE INDEPENDENTS, THE GOVERNMENT POSITION IS NOW PRECARIOUS. 
AT THE MOMENT PUBLIC OPINION IS 
PRETTY SOLIDLY BEHIND LYNCH AND HOSTILE TO THE IRA, AND EACH SUCCESSIVE OUTRAGE CONFIRMS THIS. 
EVERYONE IS TENSED UP WAITING FOR BUT THE HOSTILITY AND THE 
ACTION ARE AGAINST THE OFFICIALS AND THE PROVISIONALS ARE WAITING OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT. 
THE NEW PROPOSALS, AND IN FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTRA POLITICAL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE TWO OUTRAGES I HAVE TO REPORT THAT WHILE FOR THE MOMENT THE HEART IS SOUND, HOPE DEFERRED COULD MAKE IT SICKER THAN EVER.

was now improving and that although his injuries were serious the Doctors were confident that he would pull through. 
Mr. Ramsey said that Mr. Faulkner had asked him 
to mention in passing that next Friday he would be having a meeting of the Unionist Council, in a large party gathering. 
to have another talk with him before long. 
that any invitation to visit London could be deferred until after next Friday, though he would, of course, be very ready to communicate by letter or by telephone next week. 
I asked Ramsey whether this was because Mr. Faulkner felt that a visit to London before next 
Friday would arouse speculation which it would be difficult for him to deal with at the Friday meeting. He said that the thought was perhaps that if there was something that was being mutually considered by Mr. Heath and Mr. Faulkner, it would not be very convenient to have the "faithful" gathered immediately after it. 
He knew that you would probably be wanting He hoped

’’ THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER WHICH THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR 
FORWARDED TO ME ON 21 FEBRUARY. I AM MOST GRATEFUL FOR THIS ACCOUNT OF DR. HILLERYS TALK WITH YOU IN ROME, AND FOR THE MODERATING INFLUENCE YOU BROUGHT TO BEAR. I KNOW THAT I NEED NOT EMPHASISE AGAIN OUR DETERMINATION TO SEEK 
A POLITICAL SOLUTION IN NORTHERN IRELAND THROUGH NEGOT ATION. MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE URGENTLY CONSIDERING WHETHER THERE IS SCOPE FOR NEW INITIATIVES. DR. HILLERY MENTIONED TO YOU THE DESIRABILITY OF A RETURN BY 
THE LEADERS OF THE MINORITY IN NORTHERN IRELAND TO THE NORTHERN IRELAND PARLIAMENT. HE IS, I THINK, WELL AWARE THAT WE HAVE LONG HOPED THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MINORITY WOULD FIND IT POSSIBLE TO RECONSIDER THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN DISCUSSIONS. YOUR THOUGHTFUL LETTER SHOWED THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR US, IN PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, TO ACCEDE TO THEIR DEMAND THAT INTERNMENT SHOULD FIRST BE COMPLETELY ENDED. IT WOULD NOT HELP THE CAUSE OF PEACE, IF A LARGE NUMBER OF GUNMEN WERE RELEASED. AS FOR DR. HILLERY’S REFERENCE TO THE BARRING OF SECURITY FORCES FROM ENTERING CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CITIES, I SUSPECT THAT DR. HILLERY HIMSELF PRIVATELY RECOGNISES THAT THIS IS A RECIPE FOR ANARCHY.

25 FEBRUARY 1972 Incidents in the 
last 24 hours The Dundalk-based Provisionals suffered a significant setback 
when five of their members were captured in an ambush by 7 RUA, south of Newry. The ambush was prepared after information had come through Special Branch channels that an IA group would be coming over the border to blow up some lock gates at the head of Carlingford Lough. The group comprised six men and it is known that they were briefed for the raid by Meehan and Doherty. 
They crossed the border by car 
in mid-morning; one man was dropped off at the Customs post and the remainder went on to the lock gates and started to prepare charges for blowing them. The ambush was sprun at this point and all five men were captured - one of them having first attemptod to escape. The sixth man, on hearing the shooting, held up the Customs officer, prevented him from using the telephone and forced him to drive him back. over the border 
- after which the Customs officer was allowed to 
return to the north. 2. 
the Newry Provisi onals, 
The five men who were arrested include the OC and the 2 IC of who is 
and 
believed to be one of the seven Provisionals who were set free by the District Justice at Dundalk recently. 
are both wanted 
for various shooting attacks on the border. Two rifles and a pistol were captured with the men toether with some ammunition and of course the explosives in the two charges 
- one of them containing 60 lbs and 
the other 57 lbs. 3. 
It is hoped to achieve further publicity this for successful 
operation, though there will probably be difficulties about saying very much about he initial tip-off.

NORTHERN IRELAND February 1972 SITUATION NO 84 Incidents in the last 24 hours In Belfast two attempsts were made yesterday to blow up buildings 
in which troops are accommodated. In Andersontown, about midday under cover of an exchange of shots - 
two youths and a girl placed a 
50 lb bomb in a house adjoining the post occupied by 12 Light AD Regiment. It fortunately failed to explode and was dismantled. Earlier in the day a petrol tanker was hijacked and the driver was forced to drive it to Albert Street, in the Divis area, where it was parked against a wall of the mill occupied by a company of 1 Glosters, where two bomb (each of 5 or 10 lbs) were left in it. The first bomb exploded in the cab; the fire brigade were present by the time the second exploded in the trailer and, although it split the tank, were able to prevent a large fire. 2. 
One other bomb in Belfast was detonated under controlled 
conditions. Near Dungannon an explosion wrecked two electricity transformers and cut off power in the area. There were two small explosions in Londonderry. 3. 
There were eight shooting incidents in Belfast, five in 
Londonderry and one at Kilreel, Co. Down. No casualties were caused. There were three armed robberies in Belfast. 4. 
The funeral of the four men killed in the car which blew up at 
Castleregh on 21 February took place during the day. A procession of about 200 formed, halting at Leeson Street where four pistol shots were fired over the cortege. As in the Ardoyne on the previous day, the mourners deliberately obstructed attempts to arrest those who had fired and there was some strong-arm activity. 5. 
Three wanted persons were arrested during the period.

Northern Ireland The questions for discussion at tomorrow’s meeting can perhaps be 
grouped under 3 heads:A. The substance of the Policy. B. 
The hazards of acting. C. The timing of action. 
A. 2. 
The substance of the Policy The memorandum before Ministers deals only with the interim period 
of commission government. For this purpose it assumes approval of the long term plan to be worked out during the interim period (i.e. a revised form of Government and Parliament at Stormont coupled with periodical referenda on the Border and a progressive relaxation of internment). is acceptable so far as tomorrow’s meeting is concerned. 
But when the 
matter is put to Cabinet it will, of course, be necessary to expose the long term plan in detail, as well as the arrangements for commission government; and we shall in particular,have to decide how much should be said about the long term plan - especially as regards the relaxation of internment 
- when 
commission government is instituted. 3. 
As regards the interim period of commission government itself, the 
following points need to be noted and/or decided:(i) 
There is to be a separate Minister for Northern Ireland. Is this right, as distinct from leaving the Home Secretary in charge? If so, how many junior Ministers will he need? Possibly one in the Lords and one in the Commons, the latter being required to spend a great deal of his time in Belfast. And is the Minister to be wholly separate from the Home Office; or can he rely on it for such "common services" as establishments, finance, etc. ? 
(ii) 
On any of these hypotheses it would be wise to select the individual who is to be the Minister and to give him as much advance notice as possible in order to enable him to get to grips with the problems which he will face. 
(iii) He will need supporting United Kingdom staff - both in London 
and in Belfast. How many? Where from? And how easily available ?

E.38/D/MIN/RB/5 February 1972 At the Gen 77 meeting this morning the Prime Minister said 
that in the context of Thursday’s statement on the Parker Report he would like to be in the position to say that guidelines had been issued to the Army concerning the use of wall-standing and hooding other than for the purposes of interrogation, and that instructions made it clear that the Army should not be involved in interrogation and routine police questioning, which are matters solely for the RUC. 
He also asked to see the

had been applied on a number of occasions in the past under successive Governments in various parts of the world were applied in Northern Ireland to 12 detainees, and in October to two more. 
They considered that "there is no doubt that 
the information obtained by these two operations directly and indirectly was reponsible for the saving of lives of innocent citizens." 
They concluded that the use of the methods 
involved could indeed be justified in exceptional circumstances subject to further safeguards which they recommended. 
The 
Government consider that while there is much to be said theoretically and practically in favour of these arguments, in present circumstances the methods in question are not necessary or desirable in the public interest, and that the practical and legal difficulties of their continued use outweigh any advantages that they might possess. 
The Government have therefore directed that they should no longer be used. 28th February, 1972

AD HOC CONFERENCE TO BRING ABOUT AN END TO IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT TRIAL 
Seventy persons acting as Representatives or Observers for thirty-five Organisations responded to an invitation to an Ad Hoc Conference held on Sunday at the Student’s Union in Queens University. 
The Organisations bridged the Social, Political and Religious divide. They were as follows:- 
Gaelic League University ad Training College Chaplains Forresters Humanists Hibernians Womens’ Action Committees Representatives of Medical Profession Minority Rights Association Catholic Ex-Servicemens Association Representatives of Legal Profession New Ulster Movement Central Citizens’ Defence Committee N.I.Civil Rights Association Andersonstown Civil Rights Committee Irish Congress of Trade Unions Association of Legal Justice Alliance Party

The following resolutions were passed unanimously:1. This Conference cas for the immediate ending of Imprisonment without trial. 2. This Conference be constituted as a Standing Conference for the purpose of 
achieving liaison with all groups and individuals who are committed to help end imprisonment without trial and to stimulate ideas helpful towards this end. 
3. The Convenors were instructed to form a Committee representative of those attending to implement Conference decisions. 
4. The Conference decided that if imprisonment without trial is still operative on February 9th (the sixth month anniversary of its introduction) that their campaign and activities should commence on that date. 
The Conference recommended to the Committee that a massive public relations campaign should be undertaken to achieve its aim and that this should be directed in the first instance at home to people of all denominations, the feeling being that if the real meaning of this arbitrary imprisonment with its human tragedies were known and understood, then the whole community would unite in rejecting it. It was also recommended that the Committee should concern itself with a circulation of publications and information directed at public opinion in the U.K., Europe and throughout the world. 
It was suggested that it should be emphasised 
that imprisonment without trial has not worked in Northern Ireland and has largely contributed towards making Northern Ireland ungovernable. It was recommended that a Legal Advice Service for internees and their families be established. 
It was also recommended that the Conference contact the Trade Unions and the

21st February, 1972. Sir, I am directed by the Governor of Northern Ireland to refer to my 
letter of February 10, in which I acknowledged your telex message of February 9, and said that His Ecellency had caused it to be referred to his advisers, in accordance with the Constitution. Lord Grey has since received an undated document, headed "Ad Hoc Conference to bring about an end to Imprisonment without Trial", which shows that copies of the telex message were sent to a number of persons, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Secretary of State for the Home Department, but not to Ministers here. 
Your telegram urged the ending of internment upon the sole ground 
that it had not worked, but the message made a number of other very serious criticisms of the principle and practice of internment and these merit a reasoned reply. 
Imprisonment without trial was described as being "unjust" and 
"immoral". I am to observe that although article 5 of the Convention for the protection of Human Right and Fundamental Freedoms declares the principle that no one shall be deprived of his liberty unless convicted by a court of law, or for certain other limited reasons, article 15 recognises that this principle may have to be abrogated "in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation". The Ad hoo Conference presumably questions the moral right, or indeed the duty, of the Government of Northern Ireland to protect the community against armed terrorists by this means. 
The Government of Northern Ireland has, with regret, deemed it 
necessary to intern people as a measure directed against organisations whose declared aim it is to overthrow the institutions of the state by violence, including indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population. Such organisations have been denounced by the Churches in Northern Ireland, including the Roman Catholic Church. The Government regrets, therefore, that internment here should be described in your message as "sectarian". 
His Excellency’s advisers strenuously contest the claim in your 
message that internment has caused death and destruction. So far from its being a cause of death and destruction, it was introduced only because other measures had proved inadequate to counter the campaign of death and destruction previously launched by the organisations seeking to overthrow the institutions of the state. It is regrettably

PRIME MINISTER At your suggestion, I telephoned Lord Parker this 
Lord Parker said that he still believed 
afternoon and asked him whether he had had any further thoughts about the feasibility of special courts to replace the present internment procedures. 
that the nub 
of the problem was the safeguarding of the identity of key witnesses, not only from the press and the public, but also from the accused and his legal representative. 
He 
still thought that it was essential to a fair trial that there should be a confrontation between the witness and the accused. 
On reflection, however, he did not think that 
either the accused or his legal representative was necessarily entitled to know the identity of the witness or be in a position to recognise him. 
that the answer might be to put the key witness in the witness box where he could be seen, but allow him to be 
in civilian clothes and no name would be given. He thought, therefore, 
substantially disguised, e.g. by dark glasses and false moustache etc. 
Service and police personnel could appear The court 
would, however, have to know the identity of the witness and ought to be given the power to decide in each case whether it was justifiable that this procedure should be followed. 
to have a witness behind a screen as there would then be no confrontation. 
he had suggested would probably be followed by Lord Widgery in Coleraine. 
to the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor’s Office, who are considering special courts as an alternative to internment. 
No doubt you would like me to pass these views on 
prepared by the Cleverley Committee, which is apparently a group of progressive-minded young unionist lawyers. 
You will also be interested to see the attached note The 
handout was given to the press, but attracted hardly any attention. 
I shall draw this also to the attention of the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor’s Office.

PRIME MINISTER Parker Report been agreed at official level with the Ministry of Defence. 
The draft statement has been prepared by the Home Office and has Its 2 most 
prominent features, on which Ministers will wish to concentrate, are that it makes no reference at all to the question of legality (although the point is touched on in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Notes for Supplementaries) and that t commits the Government to abandoning the use of the disputed techniques, anywhere in the future, as an aid to interrogation. 2. 
I think that this is broadly in line with the conclusion which 
Ministers reached at their last discussion. But they reached it only with considerable uncertainty; and I am wondering whether, when they see it in cold print they will still think that it is right. 
This, for the following 
reasons:(a) The illegality of the techniques in Great Britain is not in dispute. But as regards Northern Ireland they are the subject of a Court case which has not yet been heard; and the Parker Committee themselves regard this as sufficient reason for suspending judgment Why need the Government go further? 
(b) The majority report contains, in paragraphs 35 - 42, certain detailed recommendations including a proposal in paragraph 37 that guidelines should be laid down by Ministers about the use of the techniques on the advice of a small and experienced committee. If it is decided that these techniques will never again be used in any circumstances, most of these recommendations presumably fall away, But Ministers may wish to consider the precise significance of the statement in paragraph 35 
- " It is, however, 
we think of importance that except in so far as their use is required for purposes of security and safety, these techniques should only be used in cases where it is considered vitally necessary to obtain information. " 
It is not clear whether the 
majority’s remarks on illegality, in paragraph 2 of the report, include the use of the techniques for security and safety as well as their use for general "softening" up of those being interrogated. But the clear implication of the second of the Notes for Supplementaries is that in relation to security and safety the

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
(d) The changes in the text of the Parker report on grounds of security are minimal and purely verbal. But the Leader of the Opposition might complain if you did not mention them to him; and we must in any case give him an advance sight of the report. 
(e) The draft statement as finally approved, together with a copy of the report, should be sent to Mr. Faulkner, perhaps over the weekend. It might also be desirable to warn Mr. Lynch shortly before publication. 
(f) When the draft statement has been settled, Ministers should consider the principles which are to govern interrogation in depth in future. The selection and training of interrogators will be important; and although the Secretary of State for Defence did not warm to the Parker recommendation that interrogation should always be conducted by Service personnel, there is something to be said for entrusting it to a disciplined force under the direct control of Ministers. Moreover, more detailed advice must be provided about the extent to which the law will permit the disputed practices to be continued for security and safety. 
Finally, the detailed recommendations in 
paragraphs 35 - 42 of the report should be examined in order to ascertain how many of them - e. g. the attendance of a doctor throughout interrogation safety" hypothesis. 
- are relevant to the "security and In short, the Home Secretary and the 
Secretary of State for Defence should take particular pains to satisfy themselves that the techniques in question, if they are to be used at all henceforward, will only be used under carefully controlled conditions and with the full knowledge and approval of Ministers.

1. The Home Office and the Ministry of Defence, in conjunction with 
HQ Northern Ireland and the UK Representative in Belfast, have reviewed the administrative arrangements for internment. One of the main objects was to see what dispositions could be made now against a possible decision to begin running down internment. 
2. All internees have now been divided on paper into three categories, the 
highly dangerous, the dangerous and the less dangerous. 25% fall into the first category, 50 into the second and 25% into the third. 
3. At the end of February, another compound at Long Kesh will be ready and it 
is proposed to transfer to it most of those in the less dangerous category. There are great difficulties in preventing control of internment camps from passing to the IRA leadership, but the opening of a new compound for the less intransigent provides an opportunity for establishing proper control. 
4. An experienced governor of this new compound could also help to decide 
whether the paper sift of the less dangerous was reasonably accurate and devise a regime to prepare the men for release. 
5. It is unlikely, however, that the Northern Ireland Prison Service will be 
able to provide a Governor with the necessary qualities. It is, therefore, proposed to look for a suitable man from the Prison Service here. (The Governor from the English service seconded to take charge of Magilligan Camp is reported to be doing well.) 
6. The opening of another compound also means that a more senior man is 
needed to take charge of and manage the camp as a whole. It looks as though this too will have to be done by a governor from the Prison Service here.

Lord Parker’s Committee on Interrogation Procedures 
Lord Parker called on the Prime Minister at 
5.30 p.m. on Friday, 4 February to tell him about the work of his Committee on Interrogation Procedures. 
Lord Parker said that he was sorry that he 
had not been able to produce a unanimous report. The Prime Minister thanked him for his efforts. 
Lord Parker said that, as was apparent from 
the reports, all three members of the Committee had been struck by the fact that no thought had been given to the legality of the techniques of interrogation which had been employed. When the Northern Ireland Attorney-General had given evidence to the Committee he had been indignant that he had not been consulted about what had taken place. 
The Prime Minister asked Lord Parker what he en to ensure protection or 
should be 
had in mind in the suggestion in the Majority Report that ste 
the legal position of those taking part in such operations. Lord Parker said that Lord Gardiner had taken the purist view that no Minister could ever give authority for something to be done which was against the law. 
The other two members of the Committee felt that this as unrealistic. They fel

Lord Parker’s Committee on Interrogation Procedures 
Thank you for your letter of 1st February inviting me to draw 
attention to any points the Prime Minister should bear in mind when he talks to Lord Parker. 
A key passage is paragraph 38 of the majority report in which Lord Parker states that "it would be for the

It is not entirely clear what Lord Parker has in mind Sir Kenneth Jones has advised that 
it is suggested that the techniques may constitute assaults and give rise to civil action. 
Minister concerned to take advice as to the legal position and if need be to take steps to ensure protection for those taking part in the operation". 
the only steps open to the Minister for this purpose would seem to be: 
(i) to obtain the necessary cover by introducing enabling legislation; 
(ii) to secure the passage of a Bill of Indemnity in respect of the illegal actions he has authorised; 
(iii) to ensure that the techniques are kept within the limits of the domestic law. 
The Prime Minister may wish, in discussion with Lord Parker, to enquire whether he himself had a particular course in mind. 
As the Prime Minister is seeing Lord Parker this afternoon I am 
writing now, although I would normally wait until the Home Secretary had himself had an opportunity to consider the advice to which I have referred.
