NORTHERN IRELAND BACKGROUND 1. 
You will recall that GOC Northern Ireland has asked for 
a battalion (in addition to the Spearhead) to be available on call at 7 days notice from mid May to mid Sep. 
NOMINATIONS AND PENALTIES 2. 
The Spearhead. There would of course be no difficulty 
in deploying the Spearhead as the first reinforcement unit. But the Spearhead units are all scheduled for a 4 month tour later in the year and if deployed to Ulster for more than, say, 3 weeks the published Relief Programme would have to be re-cast with the usual disruption penalties.

SSNI has decided that the Local Government Elections (LGE) are to be held

areas over the period of the LGE and forward their assessments by 30 Apr. Their assessments for the NIAE will follow later. Aim 
3. The aim of this paper is to consider the security implications of both the 
LGE and NIAE and to make a preliminary estimate of reinforcements required. The Elections 4. 
General. There are a number of significant differences between the 
Border Poll and the two forthcoming elections. a. 
The Border Poll was a plebiscite requiring either an affirmative 
or a negative vote on a single, highly emotive issue; the LGE and NIAE will be contests to elect representatives from candidates of a number of opposing parties, representing a wide range of policies. 
b. The Border Poll was based on the 12 Westminster Parliamentary 
Constituencies; the LGE will be based on the 26 MacRory Districts; the NIAE, although based on the 12 Westminster Parliamentary Constituencies, will elect 78 member, about the same number (Commons and Senate together) as the old Stormont Parliament. 
c. The LGE and NIAE will be the first major electoral contest since: 
(1) The General Election and the beginning of the current troubles in 1969; there has been no opportunity for the changing political pattern 
- to be reflected at the polls since then. 
(2) The introduction of the one-man-one-vote franchise for LGE and the first since the lowering of the voting age to 18. 
(3) The 1920s to be held under the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system of Proportional Representation (PR), which has been a highly emotive issue, particularly for Protestants.

therefore the policy issues directly at stake in the LGE will not be as great was in the NIAE. 
The functions of the District Councils will not be wide-ranging and This suggests that, in so far as the contentiousness of the 
elections may generate security difficulties, the NIAE will be a greater problem than the LGE.

Although the level of violence was comparatively low over the weekend, 3 
soldiers were killed, one VSI and 3 less seriously injured. There were 36 shooting incidents, 30 of which involved SF. There was one rocket attack. One noticeable feature of the weekend was the small number of explosions which took place. There were none in Belfast or Londonderry and only 3 in other areas. 
2. The UDA protest on Saturday was concentrated in Belfast where uniformed and 
masked UDA men blocked some 70 roads in Protestant areas throughout the city from 1200-1300 hrs. The only violence reported as a result of the demonstration was the stoning of 2 military landrovers which tried to pass a road block in East Belfast. 
BELFAST 3. 
On Friday there were 2 apparent attempted murders. In one a member of the 
UDA was wounded in the arm and in the Ardoyne 2 RCs were admitted to hospital after a moving car had opened fire on a club. On Saturday the most serious incident took place near the Royal Victoria Hospital when a gunman opened fire on a SF patrol wounding 2, one of whom is VSI. 
4. On Sunday in one of 12 shooting incidents involving SF a RM Commando was 
killed and another injured when their vehicle was involved in a well planned ambush in the New Lodge Road. The majority of the shooting took place in the Lower Falls, however, where there were 6 shooting incidents. 
5. The processions for the Royal Orange Widows Fund Annual Parade, in which 
3000 people and 20 bands took part passed off peacefully. LONDONDERRY 6. 
In spite of the killing on Friday of a soldier of 3 R ANGLIAN at a VCP in 
the Creggan and on Saturday of a member of a patrol in the Shantallow the level of hooliganism in Londonderry was lower than it has been recently. There were however minor stoning incidents in the Creggan and Bogside and an attempt was made to spread a grass fire towards Creggan Camp. There was only one attempt to build a barricade and this was removed by members of the Bogside Community Association. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 7. 
The main events of the weekend in border and rural areas took place on 
Friday; in Armagh a car bomb exploded inside Gough Barracks, but only caused one minor civilian casualty, near Belleek a mine exploded under a SF ferret but caused no serious injuries and a rocket attack on HQ 8 UDR in Dungannon missed and exploded in open fields.

April 1973 NORTHERN IRELAND FORECAST OF EVENTS - WEEKEND 27 
OPERATIONAL SUMARY 1. 
- 30 APRIL 1973 Relatively it has been a quiet week and the Easter weekend itself passed 
off very peacefully with comparatively poor support for the various marches. The only trouble was in Bangor on Tuesday where Tartan Gangs rioted while the Junior Loyal Orange Lodge March itself passed quietly. Belfast has continued to have the majority of the shooting incidents but the average for the last seven days is down to about 6 a day. In Londonderry the arrest of prominent Provisional IRA leaders has led to severe hooliganism including the building of obstacles in roads and an increase in shooting incidents. The Bogside Community Association however has strived to control disturbances in their area and most of the obstacles have been cleared by the local community. In the rural areas attempts to kill SF with culvert mines and claymore devices continue but fortunately without success. 
2. Tommy Herron, as UDA spokesman, has announced that the UDA will appear 
on the streets this weekend in an attempt to disrupt traffic. It is reported that orders have been issued to all UDA companies to block traffic in their own areas from 1200 
- 1300 hours on Saturday; they have been instructed to 
wear uniform and masks but not to carry arms. This action is expected to be effective in Shankill and East Belfast and probably also in Londonderry and Portadown and possibly areas of Lurgan and Armagh. It is reported that they do not intend to confront SF and trouble is not expected.

Annex A to A/BR/30/1/MO4 Dated 25 April 1973 
HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING 25 APRIL 1973 
GENERAL 1. 
It has been a very quiet week by current standards. There have been 101 shooting 
incidents, 69 of which involved the SF, and this is the lowest total for a month. There have been 10 bomb explosions which is the lowest amount since early January. No members of the SF have been killed and, although 38 were wounded or injured, none of these was serious. A 13 year old boy was killed in the crossfire between terrorists and the SF but no other civilians have been killed as a result of violence and there have been no apparent attempts at sectarian murder. 
2. The usual number of Catholic and Protestant Easter parades, marches and 
commemorative services were held throughout the Province during the weekend. They all passed without incident although David O’Connell made a brief and unexpected appearance at a Provisional Sinn Fein service in Belfast’s Milltown Cemetery. The most noticeable feature about these Easter activities was that both the Provisional and Official IRA attracted fewer supporters than they had in previous years. 
3. The 2 most serious shooting incidents both occurred in Belfast on Thursday. The 
first was in the Clonard when at least 3 gunmen fired 60-70 rounds at a mobile patrol. Four soldiers were slightly wounded and a terrorist bullet also struck and seriously wounded a pregnant woman. Later in the day at least 2 gunmen fired about 70 rounds at an SF OP in the Ardoyne and fire was returned. During this exchange, a civilian car drove through the area and the passenger, a 13 year old boy, was hit and subsequently died. 
4. Of the 10 bomb explosions, 2 are thought to have been the work of Protestant 
extremists with the IRA responsible for the remainder. Six bombs were planted in Londonderry on Saturday and 4 of these exploded; one exploded in a Catholic bar slightly injuring one member of the SF and 3 civilians. Another significant incident occurred when a particularly cunning bomb was planted near the Border in the Forkill area. A lorry was parked across the road with a suspicious package in the cab, but this transpired to be a hoax to draw the SF to the scene. The terrorists expected the SF to approach from the north, the obvious direction, whereupon they intended to command detonate a double milkchurn bomb of 200 lbs. Having done this, the terrorists expected the SF to follow the command wires to their source where 8 explosive devices were well concealed in a semicircle round the battery; these would have been detonated by radio control. This triple phase device was defeated by a combination of the alert SF tactics in not following the obvious routes; the use of a search dog and a helicopter; and the skill of the ATO. The search and tracker dogs are proving invaluable in these type of operations and, since the successful ’track’ following the claymore explosion near the Creggan on 12 April, they are increasingly in demand. Culvert mines remain a serious threat to the SF in the rural and Border areas. Although the number of bomb and mine explosions this week is fewer than usual, a further 17 bombs or mines were neutralized by EOD units after they had been planted. There were in addition 8 hoaxes and 35 false alarms. 
5. The SF arrested a total of 149 suspects of whom 70 have either IRA or Protestant 
extremist intelligence traces. Sixty two of these were members of the IRA including 17 officers.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 240700 TO 250700 HRS APRIL 1973 1. There were 14 shooting incidents of which 12 involved SF (Belfast 6/5, 
Londonderry 5/5, Border -/-, Rural 3/2). There was one abortive rocket attack (Belfast) but no explosions. The Junior Orange Marches in Bangor passed off peacefully but Tartan gangs were also present and rioted. In Londonderry there was shooting in the Creggan, Bogside and Shantallow and in one instance shots were fired at SF from behind a stoning crowd. There were some good finds during the day and arrests included 4 officers and 4 volunteers of the Provisional IRA. In East Belfast however, 
(QM 3 Provo), having been arrested by SF 
escaped from CASTLREAGH RUC Station. BELFAST 2. 
SF were involved in 5 of the 6 shooting incidents. No military casualties 
were suffered but one hit was claimed in the Beachmount area when a wounded man was seen to be removed by a crowd. In the Falls Road SF opened fire over the heads of a mob threatening to overrun a patrol. No casualties were suffered. A RPG7 rocket was fired at the SF location in Roger Casement Park, missed, and exploded in the air above the grounds of Musgrave Park hospital. There were no casualties. There were some stoning incidents in the Ardoyne and the Falls during which a bus was burnt in Iveagh Street. A youth was later admitted to hospital with burns. SF arrested 0C A Coy and OC F Coy 2 Provos, and who is QM 3 Provo. 
LONDONDERRY 3. 
The SF were involved in all 5 shooting incidents, one of which took place 
under cover of stoning in the Creggan. A blast bomb was thrown at the same time but there were no casualties or hits reported. There were several instances of stoning aimed at disrupting SF patrols, searches and arrest teams. Following the arrest of Rankin yesterday, his car was searched and 30 lbs of explosives and a large quantity of bomb making accessories found. Five ready made bombs and some accessories were found in a car stopped at the Bridge VCP. The 4 occupants were arrested, 2 of whom had Provo traces. SF arrested OC Creggan Provos and a volunteer in the Creggan. 91 baton rounds and CS were used to extract them to Creggan Camp.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM THURSDAY 190700 TO TUESDAY 240700 HRS APRIL 1973 
1. Apart from Thursday which was an eventful day throughout the Province the 
Easter weekend was generally quiet. Both the Catholic marches on Easter Day and the Protestant Apprentice Boys march (Hillsborough) on Monday passed off peacefully. The presence of O’Connell at the Provisional rally at the Milltown emetery was a much needed boast to their morale. SF had not been aware of his attendance and the usual problem of arresting a man in a crowded cemetery prevented any action being taken against him. 
2. Public and press protest against the Parachute Regiment continued and 
received a boost from the incident on Thursday when a 13 year old boy (McDowell) was caught in the cross fire and killed when at least 2 IRA gunmen fired at an OP in the Ardoyne. Unfortunately an early report was put out alleging that the IRA hit the boy and that an armalite bullet had been found. Forensic tests later showed that fragments in the body were from an SLR bullet so that although the blame should fairly rest on the IRA who started the gunbattle,Army credibility suffered from the false report. Several opposition Stormont MPs have threatened not to cooperate with the White Paper proposals unless Army tactics are changed and/o: the Parachute battalions are removed. 
3. On the other hand Community Associations in Londonderry have continued to 
have a moderating influence including calling for a Provisional IRA ceasefire during the week of the Community festival (23-30 Apr). There has been a conditional response to this appeal from the Provo IRA. However the general level of hooliganism is causing great concern. 
4. Other significant weeks of the period have been: 
a. The ambush of a 2 LI patrol in the Clonard on Thursday when four soldiers were slightly wounded and a pregnant woman seriously wounded. This had a marked similarity to the attack only a few hundred yards away on a 2 COLDM GDS patrol on 20 Feb 73 when 2 soldiers were killed and 1 SI. 
b. A rocket (2 x RPG7) and SA attack on Toomebridge RUC station on Thursday. 
c. An ingenious triple phase radio controlled explosive device near Forkill. 
d. Six bomb attacks (4 explosions) against commercial premises in Londonderry on Saturday. 
e. Severe stoning in the Bogside particularly on Thursday and Sunday. 
f. A number of culvert ines including 2 of greater than 300 lbs explosive. 
5. The only SF casualty listed was one RUC constable wounded in a shooting incident at Coalisland on Monday.

area of Ballymacarrett, East Belfast (no casualties). Outside the Divis Flats a hand grenade dropped through an open port of a Humber Pig failed to explode. Another culvert mine was found outside Dungannon. 
BELFAST 2. 
The SF were not involved in either of the two shooting incidents. There 
were no bomb explosions, but another mortar attack in the Catholic area of East Belfast occurred. It exploded harmlessly near a SF patrol. A hand grenade was dropped into a stationery pig outside the Divis Flats. Fortunately it failed to explode and ATO later detonated it. A meeting held in the Ardoyne to protest against the shooting of the Provisional officer by 3 PARA on 17 Apr, passed off peacefully. 2 rifles and nearly 600 rounds were found in searches. 
LONDONDERRY 3. 
There were no shooting incidents or explosions. 150 youths stoned a 
patrol in the Shantallow and later built four barricades. These were later removed by SF who made one arrest. There was also a stoning incident in the Creggan involving 70 youths. Two incendiary devices were found in a shop in the Strand Road and were neutralised by ATO. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 4. 
The SF were involved in three of the seven shooting incidents. There 
were no casualties or hits claimed. Soon after one of the shooting incidents in Lurgan a car was stopped and found to contain an Official IRA member and 
a known criminal, with two rifles. There were two explosions. A RC owned pub in Strabane was severely damaged by a 20-50 lb bomb. In Coalisland a bomb started a serious fire in a timber yard. A 200 lb culvert bomb was found near Dungannon and destroyed by ATO. A stolen lorry was found near the Border South of Crossmaglen and is thought to contain a bomb. ATO will deal with this later. 4 Official IRA, including 2 officers, were arrested by a VCP North of Newry. 4 men, including another 3 Officials, were arrested after an armed robbery in Bellee, and the stolen money and a pistol recovered. 10 old rifles, 6 of them thought to be drill rifles, were found during a search of a quarry at Hannahstown.

YOUR TELEGRAM NO. 200. PLEASE PASS THE FOLLOWING PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME 
MINISTER TO MR. COSGRAVE. IT IS DESIRABLE IF POSSIBLE TO DO SO PERSONALLY, BUT IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE MESSAGE REACHES MR. COSGRAVE WITH REASONABLE SPEED. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CONSIDER DR. FITZGERALD AND MCCANN NEED ADDITIONAL BRIEFING, OVER AND ABOVE WAT YOU WILL DOUBTLESS HAVE GIVEN ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION SUPPLIED FROM STORMONT, YOU HAVE AUTHORITY TO DRAW UPON THIS MESSAGE. 2. BEGINS: 
SIR ARTHUR GALSWORTHY HAS TOLD ME OF HIS DISCUSSION WITH 
YOU ON 13 APRIL. I AM INDEED GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR THE PERSONAL ATTENTION YOU ARE GIVING TO SECURITY ON THE BORDER, AND WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY MR. COONEY’S VIGOROUS SPEECH AT MONAGHAN. 3. SIR ARTHUR ALSO REPORTED TO ME THE CONCERN YOU HAD EXPRESSED ABOUT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE PARACHUTE REGIMENT. DR. FITZGERALD HAD SPOKEN TO SIR ARTHUR EARLIER ON THE SAME POINT. I HOPE YOU WILL NEVER HESITATE TO LET US KNOW OF ANY PARTICULAR WORRY OF THIS SORT YOU MAY HAVE. WE WILL ALWAYS TRY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A FULL ACCOUNT. ALL ALLEGATIONS ARE CAREFULLY INVESTIGATED: AND SHOULD ANY. INVESTIGATION INDICATE THAT THE TROOPS HAVE BEEN AT FAULT, AND HAVE EXCEEDED THE DEGREE OF FORCE JUSTIFIABLE UNDER COMMON LAW, THEN 
THE PAPERS ARE REFERRED TO THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS 4. THE PROBLEM WE FACE IS THIS. ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE TROOPS MAY BE IN PART AN HONEST EMOTIONAL REACTION TO THE MERE FACT THAT TROOPS HAVE TO BE THERE. THEY ARE ALSO IN PART DUE TO TRADITIONAL HOSTILITY DISMISSING ALL EXPLANATIONS FAVOURALE TO THE TROOPS AND PREFERRING TO BELIEVE THE WORST: AND IN PART LARGE PART - 
- AND I MUST IN FAIRNESS SAY A STRAIGHT IRA PROPAGANDA. SOME ALLEGATIONS FLARE UP 
BRIEFLY IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT, AND QUICKLY FADE AWAY. AN IRA-ORCHESTRATED CAMPAIGN LASTS LONGER, AND THE IRA ARE CAREFUL TO INVOLVE RESPECTED CITIZENS WHOSE CREDENTIALS GIVE THE CAMPAIGN

17 April, 1973 In his telegram No. 208, Sir Arthur Galsworthy 
recommended that the Prime Minister send a personal message to Mr. Cosgrave, replying to the latter’s expression of concern about the behaviour of battalions of the Parachute Regiment in Northern Ireland and in paragraph 3 of your letter of 16 April to Michael Alexander you asked for advice on this. Although we would have preferred to avoid a further message at this level so soon after the Prime Minister’s letter on the Dossier, we do not think we can ignore Mr. Cosgrave’s own words. he seems to be responding satisfactorily to our worries over the Border and should therefore receive a full answer when he in turn expresses anxiety. 
In a further telegram (No. 215), Sir Arthur has 
reported a subsequent approach on the same subject by McCann of the Department of Foreign Affairs. There seems to be some attempt by the Irish to link their worries over the Parachute Regiment with a separate proposal for a meeting of security experts. We have deliberately avoided any reference to this new approach in the draft message which I now enclose for the Prime Minister’s consideration. The Irish have not said anything new in this latest approach. The link they seem to be making is one we should wish to discourage, but we think it likely that it exists in the minds of the Minister and Department of Foreign Affairs rather than in the thinking of Mr. Cosgrave himself. 
As well as the draft message for the Prime Minister’s 
consideration, I am also enclosing a further draft telegram giving Sir A. Galsworthy the background. These have been drafted in conjunction with officials from MOD, and the outline discussed with officials from NIO. Since the Irish allegations are usually general, and seldom specific, the 
reply cannot be as closely argued as we would have liked, and the draft is set out as, first, a recognition of Irish concern; second, an attempt to provide a more balanced picture; and third, an invitation to come and see how the Army trains for Northern Ireland.

16 APRIL 
1. THE SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SENT FOR ME THIS AFTERNOON. HE SAID THAT SHORTLY BEFORE OPENING THE CONFERENCE OF IRISH AMBASSADORS WHICH STARTED THIS MORNING, THE TAOISEACH DISCUSSED WITH THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OUR PROPOSAL FOR A MEETING OF SECURITY EXPERTS, AS A RESULT MCCANN (WHO WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE TALK) HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO TELL ME THAT: (A) THE IRISH AGREE THAT A MEETING SHOULD TAKE PLACE, ON A STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BASIS, BUT 
(B) THEY WOULD PREFER IT TO BE CONFINED TO ONE REPRESENTATIVE AT THIS STAGE, AND 
(C) THEY FELT THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR US TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE SITUATION REGARDING THE PARATROOPS. 
2. I SAID I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT A MEETING OF EXPERTS WAS AGREED. 
BUT THE POINT AT (C) ABOVE STRUCK ME AS VERY ODD. ONLY YESTERDAY MCCANN HAD CONVEYED TO ME THE IRISH FEELING THAT COOPERATION ON THE BORDER IS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE. AS HE KNEW, WE HAD FOR LONG HAD PRECISELY THE SAME COMPLAINT AND HAD BEEN TRYING TO REMEDY THE SITUATION. THE OBVIOUS REMEDY WAS THE MEETING AT EXPERT LEVEL. I WOULD BE EXTREMELY RELUCTANT TO HAVE TO REPORT TO MY GOVERNMENT THAT THE IRISH AUTHORITIES WISHED TO ATTACH A PRE-CONDITION. THIS WOULD CREATE A BAD IMPRESSION ON OUR SIDE: AND IN ANY CASE, WHAT PRECISELY DID THE IRISH WANT US TO DO ABOUT THE PARATROOPS?

13 APRIL, M I P T. 
1. MR COSGRAVE’S ATTITUDE THROUGHOUT OUR TALK THIS MORNING WAS FRIENDLY AND STRAIGHTFORWARD, AND MY IMPRESSION IS THAT HE GENUINE DOES INTEND TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION ON THE BORDER. WE MUST OF COURSE GIVE HIM A FEW DAYS TO WORK OVER THE MATERIAL WE HAVE FED TO HIM. MEAWHILE I THINK WE CAN TAKE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM WHAT HE SAID TO ME ABOUT THE ACTION THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE HAS THIS WEEK BEEN TAKING WITH THE GARDA OFFICERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BORDER, AND THE ASSURANCES HE ASKED ME TO CONVEY TO THE PRIME MINISTER. 
2. THERE IS HOWEVER ONE POINT THAT IS BOTHERING THE IRISH GOVERNMENT AT THE MOMENT. SHORTLY BEFORE OUR CONVERSATION ENDED THE TAOISEACH ASKED ME TO BRING TO THE PRIME MINISTER’S NOTICE THE CONCERN HE FELT ABOUT THE REPORTS REACHING HIM ABOUT THE PARATROOPERS IN THE NORTH. HE SAID A DEPUTATION FROM BELFAST HAD BEEN TO SEE HIM YESTERDAY, AND HAD IMPRESSED UPON HIM THE RESENTMENT WHICH THEY SAID THE ALLEGED BEHAVIOUR OF THE PARATROOPS WAS CAUSING. HE REGARDED THE DEPUTATION AS CONSISTING OF ’VERY RESPONSIBLE, NON-POLiTICAL PEOPLE, MAINLY EDUCATIONALISTS’’. HE EMPHASISED THAT THE COMPLAINTS HE WAS RECEIVING RELATED SOLELY TO THE PARATROOPS, AND TO NO OTHER REGIMENT. BUT HE DID FEEL ’’GREAT CONCERN’, WHICH HE ASKED ME TO PASS ON. 
3. AS OUR TALK HAD BY THEN LASTED SOME TIME AND THE TAOISEACH WAS CLEARLY AT THAT POINT ANXIOUS TO GO TO HIS GOVERNMENT (I.E. CABINET) MEETING, I THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO DETAIN HIM ANY LONGER BY REPEATING THE ARGUMENTS I PUT TO GARRET FITZGERALD WHEN’HE RAiSED THIS MATTER WITH ME ON WEDNESDAY (MY TELNO 1 TO UKREP BELFAST). BUT AFTER MY MEETING WITH THE TAOISEACH THE SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TELEPHONED TO ASK WHETHER I HAD YET HEARD ANYTHING FROM BELFAST. ARISING OUT OF MY TALK WITH HIM AND THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ON WEDNESDAY MCCANN SAID THE COALITION

13 APRIL BORDER SECURITY 1. I WAS ABLE TO SEE THE TAOISEACH THIS MORNING (THIS WAS THE 
EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO), I SPOKE AS INSTRUCTED ABOUT THE CLAUDIA, AND THEN GAVE HIM THE PRIME MINISTER’S PERSONAL MESSAGE TOGETHER WITH THE DOSSIER AND ITS ACCOMPANYING MAP AND PHOTOGRAPH. 
2. AFTER THE TAOISEACH HAD READ THE PRIME MINISTERS MESSAGE 
I SAID THAT WE HAD BEEN MOST ENCOURAGED BY HIS OWN AND HIS GOVERNMENT’S FIRM ATTITUDE SINCE THEIR ASSUMPTION OF OFFICE. AS HE COULD SEE, THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ATTACHED DEEP IMPORTANCE TO INCREASED CO-OPERATION ON THE PROBLEMS OF BORDER SECURITY, SINCE EFFECTIVE ACTION TO CONTROL TERRORISTS OPERATING ALONG OR ACROSS THE BORDER WAS AN INDISPENSABLE KEY TO THE FUTURE. THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY PLENTY OF SCOPE FOR INCREASED COOPERATION IN THIS VITAL AREA. 
IF MR COSGRAVE AND HIS COLLEAGUES WISHED 
THIS TO BE DONE DISCREETLY AND CONFIDENTIALLY, AND WITHOUT ANY PUBLICITY, WE WOULD NATURALLY PLAY IT THAT WAY. BUT WE DID FEEL IT ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVE MUCH MORE PRACTICAL COOPERATION AT LOCAL LEVEL, AND A DISCREET SYSTEM OF ENSURING CONTINUING COOPERATION. THE PRIME MINISTER HAD PROPOSED A DISCREET MEETING OF EXPERTS, EITHER HERE OR IN BRITAIN, TO WORK THIS OUT IN DETAIL. 
WE VERY MUCH HOPED THIS IDEA WOULD COMMENT ITSELF 
TO THE TAISEACH. WHILE OUR PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO FIELD THE 3 EXPERTS SUGGESTED, BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE MOST FRUITFUL, IF IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR THE TAOISEACH FOR THE VISIT TO BE CONFINED TO A.SINGLE EXPERT TO START WITH, WE WOULD BE CONTENT: 
IN THAT EVENT OUR REPRESENTATIVE WOULD BE THE LONDON-APPOINTED SENIOR OFFICIAL.

Message to the Pope on Internment The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of 
State for Northern Ireland agree (as does Tom Bridges) that it will be helpful for you to send a further message to the Pope explaining the present position on "internment" - as he persists in calling it and expressing the hope that the Pope will be able to make a public and welcoming reference to the White Paper. When Mr. Whitelaw lunched today with Cardinal Heenan he 
discovered that the Cardinal had very little idea of the new procedures for detention. 
Cardinal Heenan said that he did not 
believe that the changes we have made were understood in Rome. In the light of this conversation and of the Cardinal’s favourable reaction to what he was told, Mr. Whitelaw thinks that there is all the stronger case for sending a further message to the Pope. I attach the following documents:- 
A draft introductory telegram to our Minister to the Holy See (Flag A’) 
A draft message from you to the Pope (Flag ’B) 
A memorandum which the Minister would deliver with your message (Flag ’C’) 
The Pope’s message of 5 April (Flag ’D’) 12 April 1973

White Paper on Northern Ireland: Exchange of Messages with the Pope 
Thank you for your letters of 9 and 10 April. While believing that the Pope’s attitude hitherto 
hardly suggests he will give a forthright lead, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary agrees with the Prime Minister that it would be helpful to send a further message explaining the present position on "internment" (as the Pope persists in calling it), and expressing the hope that the Pope will be able to make a public and welcoming reference to the White Paper. 
Self-explanatory draft telegrams are enclosed. 
These have been prepared in consultation with the Northern Ireland Office, and have been seen and approved by Mr. Whitelaw.

10 April, 1973 
the Prime Minister sending a further message to the Pope about Northern Ireland. 
I wrote to you yesterday about the possibility of No. 19 of 6 April. 
The Prime Minister has now seen Holy See telegram He is not convinced by the argument 
in paragraph 3 against a further message dealing specifically with internment since he feels that a personal explanation from himself will mate much more of an impact on Pope Paul than discussions with Vatican officials. 
Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister sees considerable attracticn in a fairly open statement of support by the Pope for the White Paper proposals; and Pope Paul may be more willing to speak out if he can be persuaded that we have taken positive steps on internment. 
Subject tc the views of the Secretary of State for Extreme 
Protestants in Northern Ireland would no doubt be critical of any comment made by the Pope: but the Prime Minister is inclined to think than the Pope’s support for the White Paper would be helpful with Catholics both north and south of the Border, especially at a time when Catholic support for the Provisional IRA appears to be declining. 
the case for a further message until he has your advice, but it may be helpful for you to have this account of his first reactions. 
The Prime Minister will not take a firm decision in Ireland Office). I am sending a copy of this letter to Platt (Northern

9 April, 1973 Dear Pud, Thank you for your letter of 26 March about the contents 
of the White Paper and its timing. I appreciate your view that there may be difficulties 
if political leaders associated with the past - and with the Stormont Parliament in particular power in Northern Ireland. 
- were to return to The continuation of direct rule 
would, however, create a great many problems and arouse strong opposition; and if direct rule is to be brought to an end the people of Northern Ireland must be left to find their own leaders. 
e need to remove uncertainty from the situation, 
and in particular to reassure the large majority of the people in Northern Ireland who are law-abiding and seek peace that the United Kingdom Government does not intend to divorce them from all say in deterining their future. 
Integration of the 
Province with the United Kingdom is not a practicable solution and uncertainty in Northern Ireland provides a breeding ground for violence. 
Because integration would not work and uncertainty is 
dangerous in this context, we have made it consistently clear that direct rule was a temporary expedient, providing an interval which we should use to construct and bring forward new proposals for the government of Northern Ireland. 
Ireland (of all political persuasions) would have good ground for complaint if we were now to defer the implementation of these proposals.

PRIME MINISTER Below is a telegram from the Minister to the Holy See 
commenting on the Pope’s message to you. I am not convinced by Mr. Crawley’s argument against 
your sending a further message. A personal explanation from you of what we have done on internment will make much more of an impact on the Pope than Mr. Crawley’s discussions with Vatican officials. 
Subject to Mr. Whitelaw’s views, 
there is considerable attraction in a fairly open statement of support by the Pope for the White Paper proposals; and he may be more willing to speak out if he can be persuaded that we have taken positive steps on internment. 
Extreme 
Protestants in Northern Ireland would no doubt be critical of any comment made by the Pope: but the Pope’s support for the White Paper would be helpful with Catholics both North and South of the Border, especially at a time when Catholic support for the IRA appears to be declining. I have asked the Departments for urgent advice, so that 
if you decide to send a further message it will arrive in time to be taken into account in public statements the Pope will be making over Easter.

6 APRIL 1973 THE PRIME MINISTER’S MESSAGE TO THE POPE WAS DELIVERED ON 
THE AFTERNOON OF 20 MARCH ITSELF. APART FROM THE POINT RAISED AGAIN ABOUT INTERNMENT (MENTIONED FURTHER IN PARAGRAPH 3 BELOW) THE POPE’S REPLY SEEMS UNEXCEPTIONABLE. 
2. I HAVE DISCUSSED THE WHITE PAPER TWICE WITH ARCHBISHOP 
CASAROLE SINCE 20 MARCH. DELAY IN SENDING A REPLY HAS BEEN MAINLY DUE TO CAUTION ON THE PART OF THE POPE’S ADVISERS WHO WERE, PERHAPS UNDERSTANDABLY ENOUGH, MORE INTERESTED IN THE REACTIONS TO THE WHITE PAPER OF ALL PARTIES CONCERNED THAN IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE PAPER ITSELF. THEY WERE ANXIOUS THAT THE POPE SHOULD NOT BE ADVISED TO LEND SUPPORT, EVEN IF PRIVATELY AND IN CONFIDENCE, TO AN INITIATIVE WHICH WAS GOING TO BE OPPOSED BY ANY MAIN SECTION OF OPINION OTHER THAN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT EXTREMISTS THEMSELVES. BEFORE COMPOSING A FIRST DRAFT OF THE POPE’S REPLY, THEY APPARENTLY SATISFIED THEMSELVES, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN DUBLIN, AS WELL AS MODERATES ON BOTH SIDES IN NORTHERN IRELAND WERE, GENERALLY SPEAKING, IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSALS CONTAINED IN THE WHITE PAPER. 
3. AS SEEN FROM HERE, THE ONE RATHER DISAPPOINTING POINT RAISED 
ONCE MORE INTHE POPE’S REPLY IS HIS RENEWED PLEA FOR THE PRACTICE OF INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL TO BE ENDED, THIS WAS SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTED AS PARAGRAPHS 58 TO 60 OF THE WHITE PAPER DEALT WITH THIS POINT AND WE HAD SENT THE VATICAN THE TEXT OF MR WHITELAW’S STATEMENT MADE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON 20 DECEMBER LAST ON THE REPORT OF THE DIPLOCK COMMISSION. WE HAD ALSO SENT THE TEXT OF THE PRIME MINISTER’S SIMILAR STATEMENT ON 28 MARCH WHICH AGAIN DEALS WITH INTERNMENT. MOREOVER, THE PRIME MINISTER. HIMSELF HAD EXPLAINED TO THE POPE OUR DIFFICULTIES ABOUT INTERNMENT

9th April 1973 Ronnie Custis wrote to you on 29th November last year 
about the introduction of a directive stating that oficers and men of the UDR whose loyalty was suspect, because they were deeply involved in the UDA, CESA or other similar organisations, would be dismissed. 
At the time the directive was issued HQ Northern 
Ireland had a list of 48 UDR members whose discharge was under serious consideration on these grounds. It was thought that several more might be involved although the total number was not expected to be large. 
The Prime Minister may like to know that up until now 
18 of those on the list have been discharged and two have resigned. A further 19 not on the original list, but now known to be in the same category, have been discharged; and one has resigned. The remaining 28 cases on the original list have been considered but it has been decided,for the present, that there are insufficient grounds for dispensing with their services. All those who have left the UDR were involved with the UDA, and there have been no cases so far of unacceptable involvement with the CESA. 
I am copying this letter to Michael Alexander, Terry 
Platt, Syd Norris and Tony Hetherington; and to Brian Norbury.

The Duke of Westminster 
Eaton Estate Office Eccleston Chester 
Thank you for your letter of 26 March about the contents of the White Paper and its timing. 
I appreciate your view that there may be difficulties if political leaders associated with the past Stormont Parliament in particular - 
Northern Ireland. The continuation of direct rule 
- and with the were to return to power in to be brought 
to an end the people of Northern Ireland must be left to find their own leaders. We need to remove uncertainty from the situation and in particular to reassure the large majority of the people in Northern Ireland who are law-abiding and seek peace that the United Kingdom Government does not intend to divorce them from all say in determining their future. Integration of the Province with the United Kingdom is not a practicable solution and uncertainty in Northern Ireland provides a breeding ground for violence.

PRIME MINISTER I.R.A. Cross-Border Activity I attach at Flag A a draft message for you to send to 
Mr. Cosgrave, at Flag B a covering letter from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and at Flag C the dossier on IRA activity which we propose to hand over. 
The map and the 
aerial photograph to which the draft message refers are too large to go in the box and will be made available to you separately. You will see that the dossier deals with the period up 
to November 1972 with separate comments bringing the story up to date. 
The reason for this is as follows. The dossier 
which was handed over to Mr. Lynch after your meeting with him last November covered the period from August to November 1972. Not long after it was handed over we had a response from a fairly low level in the Irish Government that the information seemed to them generally sound, although they had a number of specific queries. 
This was a considerably more forthcoming 
response than we had received when information on IRA activities had been handed over in the past. 
We were about to follow up 
the Irish Government’s response when the Wyman incident occurred, and action was suspended for a couple of months. 
No further 
discussions took place on the November dossier before the elections. Since the Irish authorities generally accepted the November 
dossier the Foreign and Commonwealth Office feel that it would be better to allow that information to stand, but to bring it up to date with a separate commentary. way to minimise 
They are hoping this with the Irish on points of detail; 
and to move as rapidly as possible to the stage at which action will be taken.

4 April, 1973 IRA Cross-Border Activity As you know, we have been working on a revised "Dossier" 
on ASU activity. We had hoped to put this to you a few days ago, but the preparation of the supporting documents took longer than expected. These documents, and a draft covering message from the Prime Minister to the Taoiseach, are now attached. 
The message to Mr. Cosgrave is drafted to make it plain 
that a real problem exists but that we are not indulging in recriminations, and that the Prime Minister looks upon Mr. Cosgrave as a colleague who can be trusted to take action. All the detail (save one good example) is in the supporting documents, and the message itself, though expressing the hope that Mr. Cosgrave will study the documents, refers him to only two items; namely, the photograph and the map. Both these have been designed to have the maximum visual impact, so that Mr. Cosgrave cannot fail to realise that the problem is one of formed units, regularly operating. It is not a question of angry villagers occasionally causing a riot 
- as 
the Irish sometimes suggest. The draft message to Mr. Cosgrave was seen by NIO and 
MOD at an earlier stage; subsequent suggestions from HM Embassy Dublin have been incorporated, and Sir A. Galsworthy believes the climate is propitious. The supporting material was produced in consultation with MOD, with the Army at Lisburn, and with Mr. Whitelaw’s staff at Stormont. It contains no material which could justifiably lead the Irish to suppose that we have intelligence sources within the Republic. 
A full set of the enclosures went by this week’s bag to 
Dublin, so that, if the Prime Minister approves the draft, Sir Arthur Galsworthy can be instructed to act without further delay. I should be grateful if the supporting material could be returned in due course. 
Copies of this letter and the proposed draft message 
(but not the supporting background material) go to Andrew (MOD) and Platt (NIO).

NOTE OF A MEETING IN LONDON AT 6.15 PM ON WEDNESDAY 4 APRIL 1973 
Secretary of State Mr Woodfield Mr White Mr Stevens 
Mr Garrett FitzGerald Dr Donal O’Sullivan 
During a full and frank discussion of about an hour’s duration the Secretary of State and the Irish Foreign Minister ranged over the following issues. 
WHITE PAPER Dr FitzGerald said that he was very pleased about the contents of the White Paper and surprised that it had been so well received. The Secretary of State thought its general acceptance was an indication of the increasing realisation in Northern Ireland that a peaceful settlement is needed. 
The Secretary of State said that he is most willing to see Northern Ireland party leaders to clarify points in the White Paper but he had and would continue to stress to them that he would not change any of the fundamentals. He appreciated however that many people would put their own interpretations on parts of the White Paper for their own selfish ends. 
ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS The Secretary of State said that he was worried about the number of names that could, under the new PR system, appear on the nomination papers - in some cases as many as 48 names; by Dr FitzGerald. 
this worry was shared 
Dr FitzGerald thought that moderates would come out well in the elections especially if people could be persuaded to put their "worst enemies" ie the extremists on both sides, as their bottom choice. 
The Secretary of State confirmed that he intended elections to take place in the last week of June 
- subject to the hived off Election 
Bill getting through Parliament. He outlined the difficulties of allowing Sinn Fein candidates to stand. 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS Tho Secretary of State told Dr FitzGerald in confidence that he would announce tomorrow that the date of the Local Government elections

3 APRIL, 1973 
1. THE WHITE PAPER HAS BEEN VERY WELL RECEIVED HERE. IT HAS BEEN GIVEN WIDE AND FAVOURABLE COVERAGE, ASSISTED BY MR WHITELAW’S APPEARANCE ON THE NATIONWIDE TV PROGRAMME QUOTE ISSUES AND ANSWERS UNQOUTE. IN GENERAL I BELIEVE THAT US PUBLIC OPINION NOW HAS A SATISFACTORY UNDERSTANDING OF OUR POLICIES. IT IS TRUE THAT MANY ARE STILL SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE FINAL OUTCOME AND ABOUT THE BRITISH PEOPLE’S READINESS TO BEAR THE CROSS OF ULSTER INDEFINITELY AND THAT THERE ARE STILL AREAS OF INVINCIBLE IGNORANCE AMONG IRISH AMERICANS WHO INSIST ON LIVING IN THE PAST AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE IRA, BUT THERE IS LITTLE THAT ANY BRITISH GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN CAN DO TO INFLUENCE THESE ATTITUDES. 2. MR WHITELAW HAS A HIGH REPUTATION AMONG AMERICAN POLITICAL. LEADERS AND WITH THE PRESS. IF HE WERE TO COME, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ARRANGE A SATISFACTORY PROGRAMME. I WOULD SUGGEST ONE TO TWO DAYS IN NEW YORK FOR OFF THE RECORD TALKS WITH BODIES SUCH AS THE COUNCIL FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS AND EDITORIAL WRITERS, AND TV AND RADIO INTERVIEWS, AND A FURTHER TWO DAYS IN WASHINGTON/FOR MEETINGS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS AND PERHAPS AN ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, WHICH WOULD PROVIDE THE BEST FORUM FOR AN ON THE RECORD STATEMENT (THEY NEED THREE TO FOUR WEEKS NOTICE.) BUT GIVEN THE GENERALLY FAVOURABLE STATE OF US OPINION I CANNOT CLAIM THAT SUCH A VISIT SHOULD BE GIVEN ANY HIGH PRIORITY AMONG THE DEMANDS ON MR WHITELAW’S TIME. INDEED THERE ARE QUITE STRONG ARGUMENTS FOR MAINTAINING A LOW PROFILE AND LEAVING WELL ALONE BUT KEEPING THE POSSIBILITY OF A VISIT IN HAND FOR USE IF THE SITUATION SHOULD DETERIORATE (ALTHOUGH I RECOGNISE THAT IN THAT EVENT MR WHITELAW MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET AWAY). 3. DURING ANY VISIT IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO MINIMISE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IRA SUPPORTERS TO SECURE PULICITY WHICH THEY COULD NOT OTHERWISE OBTAIN, AS THEY DID FOR EXAMPLE BY THE DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST MR LYNCH IN NEW YORK IN JANUARY. THERE WERE MILD IRISH PROTESTS OUTSIDE THE PRESS CLUB WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER VISITED WASHINGTON BUT THESE DID NOT ATTRACT PUBLICITY.

PRIME MINISTER The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is currently 
considering how the Province can best be policed in the future and in particular how to restore normal policing in the hard Catholic areas. 
One possibility is to make greater use of 
Royal Military Police to provide a police presence in such areas in the short to medium term 
the Royal Ulster Constabulary back into them. 
being able to help in this direction, I have reviewed the scope for increasing the strength of the RMP in Northern Ireland and I have concluded that it would be possible to do so. 
2. 
363 RMP together with 46 RAF Police and 120 WRAC; they are organised as a single Regiment, 1 RMP. 
The Provost strength in the Province on 1st April will be Since Operation 
MOTORMAN, elements of this regiment have carried out regular patrols throughout the Catholic areas of Londonderry, for the most part on foot and wherever possible without arms. I think it is fair to say that these patrols have made a major contribution to the improved atmosphere in that city, and it is only the danger hitherto of coming under fire which has so far prevented similar patrols from being undertaken in Belfast. There, however, other elements of the regiment have provided about half the strength of the joint RUC/RMP task force since it was formed at the beginning of December. 
3. The GOC has estimated that in order to provide patrolling 
on the Londonderry pattern in all the relevant areas of Northern Ireland 
- comprising 9 officers, 366 soldiers and 51 WRAC. This will 
enable ten extra platoons to be provided in Belfast, three more in Londonderry and four in the remaining areas of the Province. By cutting corners, I hope that the build-up can be such that between 100 and 150 of the extra personnel will be in post by midsummer 1973 and the full total by the end of 1974. 
I am 
assuming that they will be required in Northern Ireland for between 3 and 5 years.

March 1973 NORTHERN IRELAND FORECAST OF EVENTS - WEEKEND 30 MARCH - 2 APRIL 1973 
OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1. 
The level of violence this week has returned to the relatively high level 
experienced during February and in March up to the lull which occurred at the time of the publication of the White Paper. Both wings of the IRA, as anticipated, rejected the White Paper and the Provisionals stated their intention of continuing themilitary’campaign. Two events dominated the week. The first was the murder of 3 SNCO’s and the very serious wounding of a fourth, who were lured to a ’party’ in Belfast. This event produced a widespread feeling of revulsion in all sections of the community. The second was the capture by the Irish Armed Forces of a large consignment of arms and the arrest of 6 Provisionals including Joe Cahill. The number of arms finds this week have been very encouraging; not only have large quantities been recovered from both the IRA and Protestant extremists but many of the finds have led to arrests and further finds.
