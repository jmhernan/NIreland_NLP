GOSFORD CASTLE 1. As you may know, CL Northern Ireland has for some time 
been concerned over the command and control arrangements within 3 Inf Bde’s area, with particular emphasis on the shortage of co-ordinating headquarters. 
Consequently, he 
has asked that we should return to the arrangement which existed some 18 months ago, whereby the Bessbrook area was farmed by a headquarters provided from the BAOR regiment finding the 2 armoured reconnaissance squadrons. 
2. I have sounded out HQ BAOR, HQ 1(BR)Corps and DRAC, all 
of whom favour the idea, provided that the 2 squadrons are drawn from the same regiment (which they are not at the moment). They point out that such an arrangement will result in only one regiment being carved up to meet BAOR’s armoured reconnaissance commitment. 
3. 
deploy in May 74, when it (and the 2 squadrons) will be found by LG. 
This will of course obviate the need to 
I have obtained mutual agreement for the tactical RHQ to I propose that we should handle this very small increase 
in the force level in a low key, and represent it merely as a reinforcement of the existing small administrative headquarters at Gosford Castle.

1. LM to Encl 2 to A/BR/20/M04 dated 7 August 1973 We endorse the need for a new training area in Northern Ireland. However, 
bearing in mind the size of the proposed peacetime garrison, our first reaction is that the requirement shown at Annex A to Reference A may not be adequate for its needs. 
2.

the justification for the size of the proposed new training area. 
For example, we believe that a peacetime training area for this size of There should also be facilities 
for COIN training, with a CQBR, and, presumably, for helicopter-borne ATGW firing. 3. 
If a case for a battalion group training area was made it would strengthen In view of 
the major financial implications of such a land purchase this stronger justification would seem to be a sensible precaution if we are to avoid ending up with a smaller area which is unsuitable for our needs. 
4. 5. As to the requirement for backdoor training areas (paragraph 9) it must be 
realized that a battalion backdoor training area should desirably be 3km X 4km and within about 20 minutes march of barracks. 
The present provision and locations of ranges will need to be reviewed 
in the light of the future locations of Regular and UDR units. Every Regular Battalion must have a 30m range in its peacetime barracks and it must have easy access to an ETR/Gallery 600m range.

B. 1. 
NORIRELAND Signal KNT/221420Z Aug. You will recall that in your report (reference A), 
following your recent visit to Ulster, you undertook to send S of S (by 3 Sep) a formal proposal to cover the first stage of the reduction in the Northern Ireland Force Level - from 18 to 16 units in Oct/Nov. 
2. I understand you have already had sight of Northern 
Ireland’s signal (reference B) containing their formal proposals. In essence, the GOC intends to reduce the military presence in the Protestant areas of East and South Belfast. 
The effects 
will be: a. 
East Belfast, with the exception of Ballymacarrett, 
will be patrolled only periodically. b. 
South and lest Belfast and the rural area stretching 
South from Belfast and including Lisburn will be covered by only 2 units compared with the 3 at present. 
c. The force 
level in Ballymurphy and Ligoniel will therefore have to be reduced. 
Resident battalions will be required to continue to 
operate at an overstretch pitch if they are to maintain their current tasks, provide increased protection for married quarters and guard the new security prison at 
Magilligan. d. 
Protestant violence, should it erupt again because 
of the unresolved political situation, would present a greater security threat. 
However, the GOC has of course accepted these risks.

PEACETIME STRUCTURE FOR THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND Thank you for your minute of 7th August enclosing a paper 
(your paragraph 4) I think submission to SCAO is probably the next step to be taken in view of the major General Staff interest in the paper, though if SCODA interests are consulted throughout, the 
by HQ Northern Ireland on this subject. As regards procedure 
views of that committee can probably be well advanced by the time SCAC meets even if SCODA itself is not formally taking a paper. 
2. As regards the paper itself, it would seem desirable to state 
somewhere what the 1968 plan was and what the currently authorised permanent establishment is. The former is mentioned in your 
covering minute, the latter not at all. Costs will also have to be included and I think also it would be desirable to present some of the argument on the basis that a sixth permanent infantry battalion would bring certain benefits to the arms plot. No doubt ASD can give you something on this. 
3. It is I think for DS 10 to comment on the political aspects 
of deciding publicly now or in the foreseeable future, that we should have an increased permanent garrison and commit considerable financial resources to maintaining it. Similarly, DS 6 will also let you have comments on paragraph 9.e. dealing with training areas. My only comment on this is that while I agree that it is an important point, the emphasis given to training in the earlier parts of the paper seem to me to be out of phase with the real thrust of the argument for increasing the permanent garrison. 
4. My main interest, of course, in DS 7, is what is said about the 
UDR and TAVR. On both I agree the approach. In particular I was glad to see that paragraph 18 envisages little more than a list of 
names and not a "reserve" as such. As I mentioned some time ago the UDR is itself a "reserve". 5. 
One general point that arises is that the paper does not mention among the desiderata the importance of the Army becoming 
tactfully - 
as unobtrusive as possible under the conditions assumed. Thus it may make operational sense for the RUC and the Brigade Headquarters 
or indeed realistically - in present circumstances but 
it would seem a point that will have to be recognised some time. If it commands support with addressees, perhaps paragraph 14 would 
be the place to include it. 6. 
Attached are a number of minor textual comments. August 21 197

level reductions. 2. 
You asked for a note on the likely pattern of force As you know, the aim is to reach a level 
of 12 units (4 resident, 4 from UKLF and 4 from BAOR) by 1 Apr 74. 
In drawing up our outline plan, we have worked on the original assumptions that the reductions: 
a. Will not exceed 6 units in the infantry role at this stage. b. 
Will start in Oct 73 and will be phased in steps of 
not more than 2 units at a time. c. 
d. 3. Will be borne equally by BAOR and UKLF. 
May include some proportional decrease in the number of supporting teeth arm and logistic units. 
We have of course taken account of several other factors, 
including the views of HQ UKLF, HQ BAOR and HQ Northern Ireland. FACTORS 4. 
Operational. The operational situation will clearly dictate to a great extent what reductions can be made. 
But 
there remains a natural reluctance within HQ Northern Ireland to agree to a lowering of the force level unless it is imposed from outside. We have therefore based the withdrawal plan on the timings which CGS suggested to GEN 79 on 12 Jul (the best case from our, UKLF’s and BAOR’s points of view):

PEACETIME STRUCTURE FOR THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND Reference: A: 
HQ Northern Ireland 1060 G of 1 Aug 73. 1. Attached are copies of Reference A, a paper by Headquarters Northern Ireland 
on the Peacetime Structure for the Army in Northern Ireland. 2. 
Whilst it is difficult to look forward from the present very high force 
levels in Northern Ireland to a time of normality and peace, and to decide what force level will be required, there can be little doubt that the scars and hatreds engendered by the last four years of violence will leave the possibility of sudden outbursts of rioting and terrorism. A peacetime garrison of one brigade headquarters, one armoured reconnaissance regiment and two infantry battalions which existed in 1968 will not be sufficient to meet this threat. The paper assesses the size and organisation of the force which will be required and recommends that: 
a. long term improvements to existing barracks and quarters should be set in hand 
b. planning of new barracks and quarters should start c. negotiations for new training areas should be entered into. 
3. 4. These all take time to achieve and it is wise to decide the matter as early 
as possible so that works and agreements can be complete in good time for the eventual rundown of the force. 
Since the proposal involves a major redeployment and the expenditure of large 
sums of money we see that a paper based on the Northern Ireland proposal will have to be submitted to SCAO, SCODA and, perhaps, the Army Board for agreement. I would be grateful therefore for your comments on the existing document, for resulting inputs to the proposed paper, and for your advice on its future handling. 
Please will you arrange such further distribution as you consider necessary. I would be grateful for replies by 14 September 1973.
