Note of a meeting at noon on 12 May 
ALLEGATIONS OF ILL-TREATMENT The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has decided that the 
normal police procedures for investigating allegations will continue to be used. The Chief Constable has been asked to furish the Secretary of State with reports on the progress of all such investigations, and, with particular urgency, those into allegations submitted by Father Faul. The Northern Ireland Office will obtain copies of such reports. 2. 
It seems likely to emerge that the people making the allegations are 
refusing to give evidence to the police who investigate them. It will not always be the case that such a refusal will mark the end of any investigation: other information might be available, and investigations hould continue until the point is reached when no reasonable person would say they should be taken further. But whenever investigations come to an end the results and the reasons for them (including any refusals to co-operate) should be publicised. 3. 
The ’Sunday Times’ have not yet been reminded of their commitment to 
send to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the evidence for their article last Sunday on three cases of alleged brutality. The Northern Ireland Office is considering what might be arranged today. 4. 
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked for a note on the 
methods of interrogation use d by the RUC. This has a bearing on evidence that can be produced in criminal proceedings, as well as the production of intelligence The Ministry of Defence will be kept in touch. INTELLIGENCE 5. 
There have been reports of recruiting by both wings of the IRA, and that about twelve released internees are active again. The Provisional command in

11 May 1972 
P L Gregson Esq Private Secretary to the Prime Minister 
10 Downing Street London SWl 
Thank you for your letter of 1 May about the appearances of IRA leaders at funerals following the Prime Minister’s enquiry about the policy over the arrests of these people on such occasions. 
We have made enquiries into this matter and the Prime Minister may be assured that there is certainly no deliberate policy of refraining from arresting such persons. There is no doubt that many people knew or could easily have guessed that there would be a liberal sprinkling of IRA leaders at the McCann funeral and intelligence sources can often give us general (if not specific) warning when such men will turn up, but it was not known, for example, that Cathal Goulding intended to appear at McCann’s funeral. As soon as he was known to be there, checkpoints on all the roads on the border were warned but the IRA methods of getting in and out of Northern Ireland are well organised and Goulding was not intercepted. It would be possible to mount "snatch" operations when it is expected that IRA leaders will be present at any particular occasion and we may get one or two of them as a result. But there is a price to be paid for this. IRA leaders seldom, if ever, appear in circumstances where they can be arrested without a fight 
- the IRA sympathisers would not have let Goulding be arrested without giving a lot of trouble - and the political significance 
of an incident in which lives might well be lost and many persons injured has to be weighed in the balance. 
The Secretary of State’s view therefore is that it has to be left to those on the spot to decide whether they should attempt to pick up IRA leaders in circumstances envisaged by the Prime Minister. The security forces would not be slow to do so if the chance occurred and one of the more dangerous IRA men was known to be in Northern Ireland 
- some of the IRA leaders who appear are little more than front figures. 
But it is doubtful if it is worth doing so at the cost thereby of putting an end to the "low profile" of the Army. 
I am sending copies of this letter to Graham (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) and Andrew (Ministry of Defence).

Northern Ireland The agenda for tomorrow’s meeting might best be grouped under the 
three main headings of security; short-term policy; and long-term policy. A. 
Security (1) 
Violence Lord Balniel and the CGS should be invited to give the usual weekly 
report on the level of violence. (2) 
Brutality The Secretary of State and Lord Balniel should be asked to report 
the result of their further enquiries into the renewed allegations of brutality during arrest and detention. The Attorney General might also be asked whether there is any change in the position as regards the civil claims for wrongful arrest or ill-treatment, particularly in the light of the potentially damaging effect on the morale of the RUC of a continuing failure to obtain convictions. (3) Internment The Secretary of State was asked at the last meeting to consider the 
possibility of accelerating the release of, at any rate, a proportion of the internees more rapidly than the process of individual examination would permit. He might be invited to say how far this is proving to be practicable and desirable. (4) Intelligence As I reported the other day I have arranged for the Secretary of State 
and his officials to discuss with MI5 and MI6 the possibility of creating new sources of intelligence 
I hope that the Secretary of State 
will meet the agencies concerned this evening; and, if so, he should be able to report the upshot tomorrow. 
B. Short-term policy (1) 
Political How is the Secretary of State getting on as regards:- 
(a) The Advisory Commission. (b) The creation of machinery in the Parliament at Westminster for discussion of Northern Ireland business. 
(c) The plebiscite on the Border.

MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING Paragraph 7 of NIOM (72) 8 should have recorded that the Chief Information 
Officer, Northern Ireland Office , will be holding weekly meetings in London, as well as in Northern Ireland, for the purposes of co-ordination between departments. ALLEGATIONS OF ILL-TREATMENT 2. 
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Sir William Nield saw the 
Chief Constable of the RUC yesterday. The Chief Constable is analysing all outstanding allegations to see how many arise out of current criminal proceedings, how many are the subject of civil actions, and how many are being investigated under the statutory procedure for complaints against the police. The Chief Constable is also examining the instructions given to police for the questioning of suspects and taking of statements to make sure that any statements obtained are capable of being produced in evidence. He is also to consider whether any newspaper articles have publicised allegations which are part of current criminal proceedings and might therefore be subject to the law of contempt. 3. 
There is general concern at the time taken to deal with allegations of 
ill-treatment. From the public relations point of view delay means that te results of an investigation carry reduced weight, and the original allegations remain in people’s minds. The RUC are still investigating the allegations submitted by Father Faul, and are being asked for a full report. 4. 
The Northern Ireland Office is considering how allegations in general should 
be dealt with. Possible changes in the existing machinery have been mentioned but it will be preferable to use the arrangements that are already available if possible. It is agreed that unsettled allegations do harm toethe RUC and the Army. It is important for them to be dealt with quickly and for people to be satisfied that the investigations have been thorough and fair. It should be

Note of a meeting held on 5 May 
INTELLIGENCE Although IRA intentions are thought generally to be unchanged there have 
been reports that the Provisional wing intends to increase the level of violence, probably by shooting attacks and possibly concentrating on Londonderry. Training in weaponry is reportedly going on in the Republic of Ireland a few miles NorthWest of Londonderry, and the reports speak of a large number of weapons being brought from the Republic. 2. 
The strength of the IRA in the Ardoyne and Andersonstown areas of Belfast is 
reported to have increased. 3. 
Records of incidents illustrating the IRA’s tactics of retaliation and 
intimidation indicate that violence has been used for these purposes by the IRA a good deal more frequently since 24 March than before. This seems to indicate a feeling on the part of the IRA that they need to act increasingly in this way in order to maintain their position in local areas. 4. 
the "Tartan" gangs, which are better described as Protestant hooligans. OPERATIONS 5. 
There is no evidence to indicate any cohesive structure or organisation of Explosions have been fewer during the past week, and the total weight used 
also less. Shooting incidents have been slightly fewer, and casualties have been reduced (the previously high figure had in part been due to the arrival of new units). Two marches are expected in Belfast over the weekend: one by People’s Democracy on Saturday, the other by N.I.C.R.A. the following day. PUBLIC RELATIONS ARRANGEMENTS 6. 
The DPR (Army) will put to the Chief Information Officer, Northern Ireland 
Office, proposals for interviews with Army personnel, submitting them to Defence Ministers himself. This replaces the arrangement mentioned in paragraph 5 of NIOM (72) 5.

over the weekend I mentioned to you on the telephone 
that the F.C.O. and the Ministry of Defence had been uneasy at the lack of information from the Northern Ireland Office about guidance being given to the Press. I discussed this subject at length with Keith McDowall, 
the Chief Information Officer at the Northern Ireland Office, last Friday, 28 April. The upshot was that he agreed that, when he was with the Secretary of State in Northern Ireland, he would send a daily telegram to the Northern Ireland Office in London which would be repeated to me and to the F.C.O. and Ministry of Defence. In this telegram McDowall will set out the events of the day and the points made in press briefing. McDowall readily accepted that there was an important market in London for guidance about events in Northern Ireland and that it was right that No. 10, the F.C.O. and the Ministry of Defence should meet its demands. McDowall also agreed that there should be regular 
meetings of those concerned with information work in the F.C.O., M.O.D. with himself. 
I would propose to chair 
these meetings myself. So far so good. 
There remains the question of setting 
up a group analogous to the Royle Committee on Europe. I have been told in strict confidence by the F.C.O. that Mr. Whitelaw has recently turned down a proposal from the

4 May, 1972 Northern Ireland I enclose a copy of a telegram to Washington from 
the US Embassy in Dublin which was handed to Sir Denis Greenhill by Mr. Galloway of the US Embassy this morning. The telegram reports information available to the Government in Dublin about the alleged beating of men arrested in Northern Ireland during the last few days. 
Sir William Nield has seen a copy of the telegram and 
has shown it to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Mr. Whitelaw is I understand likely to mention the subject at GEN 79 tomorrow morning: he has received information of a similar character from a separate source. 
In sending this telegram to you, and to Robert Andrew 
for the personal information of the Defence Secretary, I have been asked to emphasise the need to protect the source. It is of course significant that two governments besides our own are aware of the contents of the telegram.

Note of a meeting held on 2 May 
SECURITY SITUATION An important new element has been the activity of Protestant Tartan gangs 
in street disturbances over the weekend. A series of eight bombs which damaged a factory in Carrickfergus yesterday were presumably designed to inflame opinion in an area which has up to now been relatively peaceful. 2. 
The Commander Land Force:: has prepared an assessment of the current situation 
which reports a lower product of intelligence, hardening attitudes amongst Protestants, and increased confidence on the part of the IRA particularly in parts of Londonderry and in the Ardoyne and Andersonstown areas in Belfast. Ways of ensuring that no new "no-go" areas are created are being considered. 3. 
Mr Cairncross mentioned that, following representations from members of 
the Northern Ireland Labour Party a meeting had been held in Belfast at which the police and the Army were present to discuss the handling of disturbances in East Belfast. There was a need for the security forces to act promptly to break up Protestant crowds who were threatening a Roman Catholic enclave in Ballymacarrett. There had been a feeling that the Army could have played a greater part in this, and it was agreed that they would in future. 4. 
The question of protecting RUC stations is being discussed between the 
police and the Army and may be raised again shortly in the Joint Security Committee. INTELLIGENCE 5. 
There is no evidence to support a report over the weekend that a Protestant 
para-military force of 10,000 is being organised, but the recent arrests of people alleged to have been trafficking in arms for Protestants may tend to keep the repo] alive. There is no firm evidence of inter-sectarian shooting incidents having occurred recently in Northern Ireland.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 010700hrs to 020700hrs MAY 72 
1. There were 21 shooting incidents, 11 of them involving Security Forces. There were four explosions including one at COURTAULDS CARRICKFERGUS plant which killed one man and injured 15 others. Hooligan activity in East BELFAST was less serious than it has been recently. There were only two shooting incidents in LONDONDERRY. 
A car ran into a stationary APC near STRABANE and a civilian was killed. 
BELFAST 
2. There were 17 shooting incidents of which seven were at Security Forces. There were no casualties and fire was not returned. At 1243hrs a 6-10lb bomb exploded outside CELTIC PARK football ground in MILLTOWN while troops were checking a hi-jacked bus. A shot was fired at the patrol during the incident. There were no casualties but a stand in the Park was damaged. East BELFAST was much quieter than of late although Tartan gangs were in the area. They were kept moving by military patrols and adults and clergy were also seen helping to cool the situation. There were three cases of arson but at one stage Tartan youths helped Sappers move barricades near the interface. There was other hooligan activity in ANDERSONSTOWN, MILLTOWN, OLD PARK (where Protestant youths stoned a patrol) and SPRINGFIELD Road. There was another demonstration by Protestant women and children outside CRUMLIN Road Jail. 
LONDONDERRY 
3. There were two shooting incidents, involving 2 LV rounds. No rounds were returned and there were no casualties. There was minor hooligan activity at BLIGHS Lane, BROOKE Park and the City wall. At 2030hrs a man was admitted to the ALTRAGELVIN Hospital with gunshot wounds. He is thought to have been punished by the IRA for theft. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 
4. Between 1303 and 1325hrs eight 10-201b bombs exploded in the COURTAULDS factory at CARRICKFERGUS. One man was killed and 15 injured six of whom were detained in hospital. There was extensive damage to the factory. It would appear that the culprits were employees of a sub contractor working at the factory. Most of them came from the CREGGAN Estate in LONDONDERRY and they left just before the explosions. Their van was found later abandoned 10 miles from LONDONDERRY. A telephone warning said there was a bomb in the canteen. No bomb exploded in the canteen. There were two other explosions both in SHNTALLOW near LONDONDERRY. There were two shooting incidents, one in NEWRY the other in COOLSTOWN. After the NEWRY incident a man was admitted to the DAISY HILL Hospital with gunshot wounds. It is now thought that he was hit when troops returned fire although no hit was claimed at the time. 1 DWR found two sangars near the border South of NEWRY. They were camonflaged and about two days old. At 2345hrs a civilian car ran into a stationary APC at GR 339965 near STRABANE. The driver of the car was killed and his passenger was seriously injured.

2 May 1972 Lord Cromer came to see the Prime inistr at 
10 Downing Street on Monday, 1 May, 1972 at 3.15 p.m. The conversation first turned to Northern 
Ireland. Lord romer said that the U.S. Administration were taking a very relaxed attitude on this. They 
regarded it as our problem and they realised the limitations under which we worked. Senator Kennedy had criticised the British 
Government’s role, and his criticisms had now been endorsed by Mr. McGovern; but Lord Cromer thought it very unlikely tht Northern Ireland would become a major issue in the forthcoming Presidential election. 
detected a good deal of gloom behind his recent talk with Dr. Kissinger. There was no doubt that the Administration were preparing to go to all lengths to prevent a collapse in Vietnam. It was evident that Dr. Kissinger had received no kind of assistance from the Russians on the discontinuance of supplies to the North Vietnamese and it was evident that Dr. 
Turning to Vietnam, Lord Cromer said that he 
Kissinger intended to leave with him the impression that the ability of the Russians to influence the North Vietnamese on timing and tactics Was very limited. On the other hand, student and press reactions to th escalation of bombing in North Vietnam had been surprisingly limited.

1st May. 1972 Northern Ireland Now that we have entered a new phase of our relationship with 
Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister is anxious that, henceforward, the meetings of GEN 79, starting with the first tomorrow afternoon, should tackle the problems systematically on each occasion by grouping them under their main headings and establishing, for each group, a kind of "check list" of points to be dealt with. The final form of this check list must perhaps be allowed to emerge from the first few discussions in the new series of GEN 79 meetings; but, in outline, it might be on the following lines:- 
(1) The security situation. Under this heading the meeting should deal with, inter alia:- 
(a) The current level of violence. 
(b) The disposition of the security forces, including any changes in the strength of Army units which it is possible to contemplate in relation to e.g. the "no go" areas. 
(c) Internment and detention policy. Your Secretary of State and the Secretary of State for Defence will 
no doubt indicate if there are other items under this heading which they would wish to raise as a matter of regular routine. 
(2) The short term political situation. This group might comprise:- 
(a) Northern Ireland legislation requiring action at Westminster. (b) The progress of the reforms in 
e.g. local government, etc. 
(c) The state of the Northern Ireland economy, together with any proposals for economic assistance.

Northern Ireland: Situation and Prospects (GEN 79(72) 4) 
I have indicated to the members of the group, as you suggested, that 
GEN 79 meetings should henceforward deal with the questions involved by grouping them, so far as possible, under three main headings and establishing for each group a kind of standard "check list" which could be used as the basis of discussion on each occasion. We should perhaps avoid finalising the precise form of this "check list" until we have had the first meeting or two in the new series; but thereafter it should be incorporated in the agenda for each meeting. A provisional grouping might be as follows: The Security Situation 
(1) 
(a) The current level of violence. (b) The disposition of the security forces, including any changes 
in the strength of Army units which it is possible to contemplate in relation to e.g. the "no go" areas. (2) The Short-term Political Situation (a) Northern Ireland legislation requiring action at Westminster. (b) Internment and detention policy. (c) The progress of the reforms in e.g. local government, etc. (d) The state of the Northern Ireland economy, together with any proposals for economic assistance. (3) 
The Long-term Constitutional Solution (a) The means by which long-term constitutional proposals would 
best be devised. (b) The progress in working them out. (c) The method and timing of their ultimate implementation. If this format is adopted in principle, the discussion of GEN 79(72) 4 
might follow the same order. (1) 
The Security Situation In the light of paragraph 6 of the Secretary of State’s memorandum 
the CGS might be asked to report on the current level of violence and on the disposition and tactics of the security forces. 
This would lead on to a

TAOISEACH’S SPEECH NORTHERN IRELAND. 
THE SECOND GREAT QUESTION WHICH WE MUST FACE AS A NATION IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NORTH. BUT IT RAISES A MUCH BROADER QUESTION 
- THAT OF THE 
KIND OF IRELAND WE WISH TO SEE AND THE STEPS WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE TO BRING IT ABOUT. 
THE EXPERIENCE. OF 50 YEARS HAS SHOWN CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT DIVISION AND SEPARATION DID NOT BRING STABILITY OR PEACE TO OUR ISLAND. THERE IS NOW, I BELIEVE, A REAL PROSPECT THAT WE CAN FIND A BETTER WAY AND THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO DO SO IN THE RELATIVELY NEAR FUTURE. BUT IT IS UP TO US TO ENSURE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY IS NOT LET PASS. FOR SOME TIME WE HAD BEEN URGING ON THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT THAT THE EXISTING STRUCTURES OF GOVERNMENT IN THE NORTH MADE IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING PEACE AND STABILITY TO THE AREA. THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT CAME TO SHARE THIS VIEW TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT. MR LYNCH CONTINUED. I HAVE ALREADY WELCOMED THE IMPORTANT INITIATIVES IN REGARD TO THE NORTH WHICH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TOOK AT THE END OF MARCH AND I HAVE SAID THAT THEIR ACTIONS IMPOSED UPON US IN TURN THE THE NEED FOR A RESPONSE. WITHIN THE PAST FEW DAYS, AT MY REQUEST, THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DR HILLERY, TRAVELLED TO LONDON FOR DISCUSSIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND, MR WHITELAW. DR HILLERY HAS SINCE REPORTED TO ME AND TO THE GOVERNMENT ON HIS TALKS. THE GOVERNMENT NOW CONSIDERS THAT PROSPECTS ARE OPENING FOR A REAL AND LASTING SOLUTION TO OUR NATION’S TROUBLES IN A WAY WHICH WILL BRING PEACE AND UNITY TO THE ISLAND. 
TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY AND DO EVERYTHING IT CAN TO BRING SUCH A SETTLEMENT ABOUT.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 280700 hrs APR to 01000 hrs MAY 72 GENERAL 1. 
The 72 hour period ending at 0700 hrs on Monday 1 May began 
comparatively quietly but became dominated by Protestant hooliganism in East BELFAST. Shootings in and around the Catholic areas of BELFAST were high on Saturday(24)and Sunday(31 )with no evidence as yet of Protestant gunmen. Overall there were 7 shootings over the weekend of which the Security Forces were involved in 45 . There were 6 explosions. Two civilians were killed. 
There were several marches, including the one in LONDON, all without incident. 
7 RUC were injured. 
2. On Friday 28 April 2 Customs posts were damaged by armed men from over the border in one case near BELLEEK the Garda stopped the culprits but allowed them to continue. 20 civilian casualties were caused by the two explosions. 
There were only 6 shootings, 
involving Security Forces. Two hits are claimed. On Saturday 29 Aril the number of shooting incidents was 30. 24 o these occurred LAST, 12 involving the Security Forces. All occurred inside 
or at the edge of Catholic areas. In one incident an eight year old Catholic girl was killed and in another a member of a Tartan gang was wounded while stoning a Catholic bar in East BELFAST. Rioting Tartan gangs caused extensive damage to Catholic property and six RUC wore injured during the evening. 
The three explosions of the 
day occurred in Rural areas against a Telephone exchange, transfomer and factory. The ARMAGH Resistance Council march was not well attended. On Sunday 30 April there was one Orange March but little was seen of Catholic demonstrations except for an anti-peace march inside the BOGSIDE. The evening saw again the gathering of up to 250 youths in East BELFAST but damage caused does not seem to discrimin. .ate against Catholic property. There were 31 shootings, 24 involving the Security Forces, and one explosion.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 250800 TO 300800 MAY 72 GENERAL 
1. The Spring Holiday weekend had all the usual ingredients, plus the announcement on Monday evening 29 May of an indefinite case fire by the Official IRA because of "the growing danger of 
sectarian conflict". 
The truce was dismissed by the Provisionals. Another major feature of the weekend was the continued bombing campaign especially in BELFAST, where a significant amount of structural damage was caused. Another IRa bomb went off in transit killing at least six Catholics. Protestant barricading was neither as widespread nor an serious as anticipated, though the LAW/ VANGUARD rally in BELFAST on Saturday had sinister para military features. 
2. During Thu/Fri 25/26 May, it was relatively quiet with twenty shooting incidents, of which nine did not involve the military; and two bomb explosions, one of which caused a minor civilian casualty, the only casualty of the day. Propaganda sheets, encouraging soldiers to desert, were distributed in BELFAST. For the second day running there were no reports of hooligan activity in LONDONDERRY. 
3. During Fri/Sat 26/27 May, there were sixteen shooting incidents with the Security Forces involved in nine of them, opening fire in two. There were seven bomb explosions. Total casualties for the period were three military wounded, two civilians killed, 50 civilians wounded and two unconfirmed terrorist casualties (A car bomb in the FALLS accounted for one of the dead and 42 injured civilians). 
4. During Sat/Sun 27/28 May, there were twenty shooting incidents and six explosions. One of these explosions, in the Catholic Short Strand, Belfast was an IRA bomb in transit and killed at least 6 civilians, e of whom were on the wanted list, and injured another 17. All of them were Catholics. In Londonderry the City Hotel was badly damaged by a bomb. Near FORKILL , in Co Armagh a car bomb was remotely detonated as a 1 DWR patrol passed by. 4 soldiers were injured, 1 of them seriously. A Vanguard rally (2500) in Dungannon passed without incident as did the Law/Vanguard march (4000) in BELFAST. A few token Protestant barricades were erected overnight in the FALLS and EAST BELFAST. 
5. During Sun/Mon 28/29 May, there were thirty six shooting incidents, twenty seven of them in BELFAST and seventeen not involving SF. There were four explosions of which three were in BELFAST. They caused considerable structural damage. One RUC constable was injured; a Catholic man was fatally wounded in Springfield; and three girls and one woman (two Catholic and two Protestant) were injured in two inter sectarian shooting incidents on the ARDOYNE/OLD PARK interface. There were no military casualties. All known Protestant barriers were removed. In LONDONDERRY, there was a peace demonstration (4000) and an IRA demonstration (6000). 6. During Mon/Tue 29/30 May, there were 42 shooting incidents of which 25 occure d in the Ardoyne after a small search operation by 1 RR. Three soldiers were wounded, one very seriously, and five terrorists were claimed hit in the same operation. A Catholic man was found shot dead between Unity Flats (RC) and the Shankill. Londonderry was extremely quiet. There were two cross border shooting incidents. In another shooting incident in Co Down civilian shot two intruders, one of who died later.

IRELAND: SPECIAL COURTS 1. 
We spoke about the Prime Minister’s query 
regarding a message to Mr Lynch. 2. 
I have consulted Mr White and Sir Stewart 
Crawford FCO and also Mr Trevelyan, Northern Ireland Office. Their view is that it would be right for the Ambassador to convey a message from HMG and to indicate that it had been seen and approved by the Prime Minister. But that they do not think a formal PM to PM message is desirable at this stage. This should be kept for matters of more importance. 
3. The Draft Telegram has been cleared with Northern 
Ireland Office. I shall despatch it to Dublin as soon as I have confirmation from you that the Prime Minister approves.

Unless you see objection you should seek an early opportunity to speak on the following lines: 
Begins: HMG warmly welcome the decision to introduce Special Courts. 
In HMG’s view it is 
now essential to sustain the efforts of those in the North who are trying to shift the emphasis from military to political activity, and in this task there is considerable psychological importance if the Roman Catholic minority see the Irish Government to be taking decisions such as that just announced. 
Continuing pressure upon the 
malign and violent elements, both North and South, together with the development of Mr Whitelaw’s policies in the North, form the best recipe for

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the 
Lord President talked yesterday evening with Mr. Michael Foot, Mr. Robert Mellish and Mr. Merlyn Rees about the handling of the legislation on local government reform in Northern Ireland. Two things very clearly became apparent: (a) they would insist on the application of proportional representation to local elections in Northern Ireland 
(b) they wanted this matter dealt with by means of a bill at Westminster, rather than by Order in Council. 
If they could be met on these two points, and if 
one other major Northern Irish matter was dealt with by bill rather than by Order in Council, they would be prepared to cooperate with the Government in giving the bills concerned a speedy passage and expediting other Northern Ireland business by means of Order in Council. The demand for proportional representation reflects 
the views of the SDLP, the Northern Ireland Labour Party and other minority parties in Northern Ireland. 
The 
minority parties see the introduction of proportional representation as an important means of breaking the Unionists’ stranglehold. The Labour Party’s demands to make this legislation 
a bill rather than an Order in Council are designed to obstruct the passage of Government business at Westminster. It became apparent to the Lord President and the 
Secretary of State that, if the Government tried to push

Note of a meeting held on 25th May 
SECURITY SITUATION 1. Shooting incidents have reduced in number during the week, from 54 on the night of Saturday/Sunday 20th/21st May to 20 on the night of Wednesday/ Thursday 24th/25th May. The incidence of explosions has not changed significantly, but remains relatively low. 2. if, as expected, the UDA put up barricades during the Bank Holiday weekend, in order to create token "no-go" areas in Belfast for 24 hours, the security forces will try to avoid confrontation unless major routes are blocked or troops impeded. 3. The Vanguard march planned in the Shankill and Woodvale areas may end in public disorder if the dispersal arrangements prove inadequate. This is unclear. The organisers have given due notice, and are said to hope that up to 12,000 people will attend. 4. If a Provisional IRA leader visits Londonderry from the Republic, the action to be taken by the security forces will depend on the circumstances. A paper has gone to Ministers on the subject. For the present, it seems unwise to attempt the arrest of a prominent IRA leader unless this can be done without great disorder and there are good prospects of securing a conviction. These possibilities seem remote. PUBLIC RELATIONS 5. The "Sunday Times" still have not sent evidence of ill-treatment of persons arrested. Mr. John Barry has said privately that the recent disclosures about soldiers in plain clothes took the wind out of his sails over the rumours of "assassination squads". He has recently interviewed the GOC. PEACE INITIATIVES 6. The recent demands for peace by women of Londonderry, and their visit to Mr. Whitelaw, showed courage and, perhaps, indicated their assurance of popular

NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMARY FOR THE PERIOD 19 MAY - 24 MAY, 1972 
Memorandum by the Northern Ireland Office GENERAL The period has again seen attempts to set up Protestant "no-go" areas 
in Belfast, but these were contained by the security forces with the assistance of the local inhabitants. Explosions remain low in number if not in intensity though shooting incidents continue with both military and civilian casualties. There have been demonstrations by Catholics in Londonderry against IRA violence. 
2. Mr Faulkner has invited Mr Craig to join a Unionist committee on a new constitution for Northern Ireland, while in the Republic, Mr Lynch has announced his intention of strengthening the laws against illegal organisations. 
THE REPUBLIC 3. 
4. There have been several instances of incendiary devices being found in 
Dublin stores, though so far no serious injury has been caused, although there was some damage to property. 
The fact that some of the prisoners involved in the Mountjoy Prison 
riot have been removed to the Curragh has led to charges that internment is being introduced by the back door, but this was denied by the Minister for Justice, Mr O’Malley. 
MR LYNCH 5. 
In Dublin on Monday, Mr Lynch said that he intended to ask the 
Government to consider how the laws against illegal organisations could be strengthened. The Government was determined to ensure that private armies would not use the Republic as a base. The Irish Government had welcomed the British initiative in the North and Mr Whitelaw’s efforts to bring peace, but extremists of both communities tried to frustrate Mr Whitelaw’s efforts. Current IRA activities were postponing community reconciliation in the North and ultimate Irish unity. 
THE UNIONIST PARTY 
6. At a meeting of the Unionist Party’s Standing Committee in Belfast, Mr Brian Faulkner announced that he was setting up a committee which would try to draw up a constitution for a new Northern Ireland, acceptable to all

Reorganisation of Local Government in Northern Ireland (GEN 79(72) 7) 
1. The Note by Officials attached to the Secretary of State’s paper 
deploys a formidable case (paragraphs 5-7 and 17-18) against a postponement of the introduction of the reorganised system of local government in Northern Ireland from 1st April, 1973. Once this date is accepted it is difficult to contemplate any change in the date of 18th October, 1972, for the local government elections. 2. 
Against this background the memorandum examines the case, both in 
principle and in practice, for introducing some form of proportional representation in the elections. Paragraph 15.A. of the Note deploys a series of arguments of principle against changing the system of election in the few months available. 
In particular, paragraph 15. A. iv. makes the 
point that to introduce proportional representation for local government at this point would pre-empt a corresponding decision for Parliamentary elections under any final settlement. Conversely, a decision to hold the October elections on a simple majority vote would not prejudice the subsequent introduction of proportional representation for local government if it was decided to introduce it for Parliamentary and/or Regional government. 
the decision for Parliamentary elections in Northern Ireland would also entail pre-empting a full consideration of the possible implications for elections in Great Britain. 3. 
The objections of principle against an immediate decision to 
introduce proportional representation are reinforced by the practical objections set out in paragraph 15. B. of the Note. 
All these factors lead 
the Secretary of State to confirm the conclusion, provisionally reached at the last meeting of GEN 79, that the balance of advantage lies in proceeding with the elections, at the planned date of 18th October, on the basis of a simple majority vote - but without prejudice to the possible introduction of some form of proportional representation at a later date in the light of whatever constitutional arrangements may be eventually adopted for the government of the Province. 4. 
The Secretary of State might also have added that pre-empting The Secretary of State also suggests, in paragraph 8 of his covering 
memorandum, some answers to the criticism that it would be inappropriate to proceed in this way after suspending the regional parliament at Stormont on which the new system of local government was predicated. 
But, if we are

Note of a meeting held on 23rd May 
1. Mr. Hetherington (Attorney General’s office or a representative, and Mr. Elliott (Northern Ireland Office) will attend NIOM meetings in future. SECURITY 2. The barricades put up in Belfast last Sunday 21st May were taken down with the co-operation of responsible Protestant leaders. Although those barricades were primarily a publicity measure, Protstants may not be so ready in future to see barricades dismantled. More barricades are to be expected towards the end of this week. 3. The demonstration by Catholic women in Londonderry against the killing of a member of the Royal Irish Regiment, and against IRA terrorism generally, is to be welcomed (as are the "Signatures for Peace" reported in the "Irish News") but its significance should not be over-estimated. 140 members of the Regiment are on leave in Ireland, and one more of them is missing. The possibility of stimulating isolation of the IRA is to be explored. The Provisionals are said to mistrust their chances in any ballot that might be devised. 4. There has been an increase in border incidents, recently, but also an increase in activity by the Gardai. However, the arrests reported in paragraph 6 of NIOM (72) 11 numbered only 3, not 11. PUBLIC RELATIONS 5. The disclosure about soldiers in plain clothes (NIOM (72) 12 para. 7) has been successful. 6. The "Sunday Times" "Insight" team are said to be preparing an article on "no-go" areas. Mr. John Barry is to see the GOC this afternoon. He has also asked to see the Army film of events in Londonderry on 30th January and, subject to Mr. Whitelaw’s concurrence, is to be shown it. The "Sunday Times" leader on 21st May was unusually responsible, but a corresponding trend in "Insight" reporting cannot necessarily be expected.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 0700HRS 22 MAY to 0700HRS 23 MAY 72 GENERAL 
1. For the first time for some weeks Security Forces were not fired at in ANDERSONSTOWN or BALLYMURPHY. There were 30 shooting incidents in the Province and five explosions. There were two cross border shooting incidents. Near COAGH, Co TYRONE a civilian car was ambushed, probably having been mistaken for an RUC vehicle; one man was killed and two injured. 
BELFAST 
2. There were 19 shooting incidents and a large explosion which caused 58 casualties. In ANDERSONSTOWN there were three shooting incidents, none involving Security Forces. There were two incidents when youths stoned patrols. At 2155hrs a barricade was placed in a sideroad but removed at 0500hrs. In BALLYMURPHY there were four shooting incidents, none involving Security Forces. There were three small bomb incidents, one involving a Protestant owned shop. There were no casualties. LIGONIEL and the ARDOYNE were quiet. In the FALLS there were ten shooting incidents of which six involved Security Forces. OPs in the Divis Street area were fired on four times. At 2215hrs and 2217hrs in Roden Street (on the interface with the SANDY ROW area) troops were fired at twice while dealing with an intersectarian clash involving some 100 people. Fire was returned at a gunman at the north (Catholic) end of the street. Fire was opened on a gunman in SELBY Street (interface). There were two small bomb incidents. During the evening youths manned a barrier in Bankmore Street (Protestant-SANDY ROW area). £2,500 was stolen in an armed robbery. Children handed in 400 rounds of ammunition which they found in the grounds of the City Hospital. At 0950hrs in the NEW LODGE area a 1501b car bomb exploded in the car park of the Jenny Mount Mill. There were 58 casualties including five RUC, none serious. Two telephone warnings were given and it is thought the bomb was intended to inflict maximum casualties, because after a bomb warning the workers would assemble in the car park. In BALLYMACARRETT shots were fired at RUC investigating a suspicious parcel at a Catholic Bar. ATO later dealt with the parcel which was a 10-151b bomb. Between 2147hrs and 0030hrs up to 70 Protestant youths stoned three Catholic premises in the ORMEAU Road area. 
LONDONDERRY 
3. Some 200 women from the CREGGAN protested to the Official IRA about the murder of the R IRISH soldier. There were reports later in the evening of fighting between the Provisional and Official IRA in the CREGGAN Estate after the Provisionals had called on the Officials to withdraw from "Free Derry". The Bligh’s Lane post was fired on five times and fire was returned four times. The BRANDYWELL post was fired on once. There were no casualties or hits claimed. Between 1623hrs and 2250hrs about 100 youths were engaged in hooligan activity in WILLIAM Street. During this period three acid and three petrol bombs were thrown at troops;58 baton rounds were used.

Revd. Ian Paisley: To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, if he will make a statement about the disturbances, shootings and killings in Northern Ireland at the weekend. 
DRAFT REPLY The House will wish to know that the main incidents during 
the weekend occurred following attempts on Saturday and Sunday evenings by persons primarily within the Willowfield section of East Belfast but also in the Shankhill Road section of the city to set up barriers there. 
It is contrary to H.M.G.’s policy that 
any fresh "no-go" area should be created in Northern Ireland and the security forces were obliged to intervene. cleared. 
The barriers were I am glad to say that this was done with the assistance 
of many members of the community who were aware that, whatever the provocation, their interest and the interests of the province were not best served by an attempt to set up new barricades in parts of the city. The House will have learned with regret of the brutal murder 
of Ranger William Best of the Royal Irish Rangers, who was on leave from BOOR in Londonderry. 
His body was found on Sunday 
morning on waste land by Rossville Street on the outskirts of Londonderry. 
The official IRA have claimed responsibility for 
this cold blooded murder. Another soldier also lost his Life in an ambush between Aughnaloy and Dungannon on Saturday morning.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 190800 TO 220800 MAY General 1. 
Although the Province is now quiet, it was another busy week- 
end, particularly in BELFAST where Protestant attempts to establish ’No Go’ areas were dealt with firmly by the Security Forces on Saturday night/Sunday morning. This action led to some rioting in the SHANKILL ROAD and particularly in EAST BELFAST on Sunday, and more barricade building. An ugly situation appears to have been defused by Protestant laders. In the Republic, the official IRA issued a policy statement, and one DUBLIN store was burnt out and attempts were made to set fire to five others. 
2. During the FRI/SAT (19/20 MAY) period, there were 35 shooting incidents, 11 of which did not involve Security Forces; only one explosion (in a parked car in LONDONDERRY); and three armed robberies throughout the Province. Four soldiers were wounded one of them seriously; one gunman was killed and four other claimed hit; 
eight civilians were injured. An Ulster Vanguard rally 
attended by 1,500 people in COOKSTOWN passed of quietly. Catholic hooligan activity was again high in the BALLYMURPHY and ANDERSONSTOWN areas of BELFAST. 
3.a. During the SAT/SUN (20/21 MAY) period, there were 54 shooting incidents, 10 of which did not involve Security Forces; and two explosions one of them 100lbs in BALLYMACARRET. One soldier of 8 UDR was killed in a rural ambush; One RUC was slightly wounded; and four civilians were injured. Security Forces claimed to have hit one terrorist. A LAW rally in CARRICKFERGUS was attended by 2,000 people. The most significant event was in EAST BELFAST where a Protestant attempt to establish a ’No Go’ area in WILLOWFIELD was defeated in a dawn clearance operation by Security forces, in which one civilian was wounded in fire returned at one or two gunmen. 
3.b. During the SUN/MON (21/22 MAY) period, there were 43 shooting incidents, 12 of which did not involve Security Forces; and only one explosion. One soldier of 1 ROYAL IRISH RANGERS on leave from BAOR was murdered by the Official IRA in LONDONDERRY; two civilians died, one accidentally during a bus hijacking and the other of GSW reciove on 20 May; and four were injured. Security Forces claimed to have hit three terrorists. During an active period of Protestant rioting in EAST BELFAST and the SHANKILL ROAD areas, a total of 36 barriers were built by Protestants to create ’No Go’ areas. All were cleared by about 0300hrs. Captain ARDILL was instrumental in organising their removal in th SHANKILL; and the TARTAN gangs offered their services with a flourish to the Security Forces in clearing those in EST BELFAST. An IRA propaganda exercise took place at a border crossing post near LONDONDERRY..

Note of a meeting held on 19th May 
SECURITY 1. Recent aggression by the IRA has apparently been concerned with the aim of provoking a violent Protestant reaction. Examples of this trend are the shooting at workers emerging from the Mackie Factory; the explosion at the Bluebell Bar 
in Sandy Row; and the shooting from 
Divis Flats of a young man in a car. If this is the policy of the IRA, it may be ill-judged. In itself, wanton violence by the IRA might alienate Catholic sympathies. If the aim of the IRA is to cause the Catholics to feel more dependent on the IRA for defence, by making a Protestant back-lash appear more imminent, that aim may not be achieved if the Catholics doubt the ability of the IRA to defend them against a Protestant onslaught 
if it is evident that the reason for such an onslaught is IRA provocation. 2. 
The Dublin command of the IRA probably see a Protestant back-lash as 
inevitable in any case. They appear very anxious to increase their military strength. It is difficult to tell how strong is the wish for peace among the Catholic population, particularly in Londonderry. There are now fewer overt moves for peace, and this probably marks the success of IRA intimidation. Nevertheless, the possibility of a political initiative from the minority is not to be discounted. 3.

19 May, 1972. 
NORTHERN IRELAND: POLITICAL SUMMARY FOR THE PERIOD 12 MAY - 18 MAY, 1972 
Memorandum by the Northern Ireland Office 
GENERAL 1. 
The main events have been on the security front. The weekend of 12-15 
was the most violent since the imposition of direct rule. The worst violence was sparked off by an explosion (which appears to have been an IRA accident) outside Kelly’s Bar in the Ballymurphy area on Saturday evening. This led to shooting from both the Ballymurphy and Springmartin estates and the area was not completely calm till early on Monday morning. The remainder of the period was quieter, though the situation remains tense. 
2. During the week several Northern Ireland political leaders have criticised 
Her Majesty’s Government’s policy towards Northern Ireland MR HEATH 3. 
Speaking to Scottish Conservatives in Perth on Saturday, Mr Heath said 
that withdrawal of British troops from Northern Ireland would be disastrous, but so also would be a policy of total relanc on military measures. In introducing direct rule, the British Government was reaffirming that the position of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom would not be changed without consent. 
MR WHITELAW 4. 
Also in Perth, Mr Whitelaw said there was now an opportunity for the 
whole community in the North to work out their future, but they would have to meet the real feeling of insecurity which he had detected in all his contacts with the majority. He told reporters on Monday that there would be no change in policy despite the events of the weekend in which he could see no real evidence of a Protestant backlash. While visiting Newry on Tuesday, he met members of the security forces, the RUC, and headmasters and headmistresses of local schools. 
UNIONIST AND OTHER OPINIONS 5. 
On return from holiday, Mr Faulkner criticised direct rule saying that 
it had given the IRA the biggest lift it had ever had. On Wednesday, 1

STATEMENT ON THE SECURITY SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND 18TH MAY, 1972 
- MR. WILLIAM WHITELAW With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a 
statement on the security situation in Northern Ireland. At the start I should like to inform the House of the 
result of the further investigations made into the incident at Kelly’s Bar since the statement which my hon. Friend the Minister or of State made to the House on Monday. 
the indications are that the bomb exploded 
prematurely whilst those intending to use it for a bomb attack elsewhere were either inside the bar or were returning to their vehicle from the bar. 
The facts do not suppot the theory that the bomb was 
planted by Protestant extremists. The action taken by the Army to restore order after the 
incident and the subsequent cross-fire between the communities was extremly well carried out by the 1st Battalion Parachute Regiment. This locality has been quiet since the weekend.. The action taken has shown the determination of the Government and the security forces to act firmly and effectively. 
Since that incident there have been further terrorist actions in Belfast andLondonderry which suggest that the IRA

Northern Ireland: Border Plebiscite The Secretary of State proposes to raise this question orally, 
presumably in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of an early plebiscite (as he undertook at the last meeting). You may, however, wish to have some discussion not only of possible timing but also of such substantive matters as how the "question" should be framed, what kind of procedure is to be adopted and how the eventual result of the plebiscite is to be dealt with. Some of the questions which might arise are:(a) Should the plebiscite simply ask whether Northern Ireland should remain part of the United Kingdom or not; or should it outline a number of options, e.g. membership of the United Kingdom, union with the Republic, independence, etc? 
(b) Should the options be stated solely in terms of national identity or should they be more fully defined in constitutional terms as well (e. g. to indicate whether "membership of the United Kingdom" would involve full integration or a new Stormont-type constitution or a GLC-type status)? 
(c) Can satisfactory arrangements be devised to ensure that one option does not emerge as commanding more support than any other but, nevertheless, only a minority of the total votes cast? 
(d) Should the plebiscite be conducted under the existing electoral machinery or with some special supervisory arrangements? (Presumably the possibility of supervision by the United Nations should be raised, even if only to be dismissed). 
(e) Should the votes be counted for the Province as a whole; or should there be a division by areas? (The latter alternative would raise grave difficulties if union with the Republic was chosen by an area or areas not contiguous with Republican territory). 
(f) Should a statutory interval between plebiscites be prescribed? To do so would pre-empt subsequent charges of opportunism; and Ministers have generally thought in terms of about 15 years as a right interval. 
2. These are only some of the questions which self-evidently arise. 
Subject to the Secretary of State’s remarks tomorrow, the right course might be to invite him to circulate a memorandum containing considered proposals, for discussion next week. 17th May 1972

Northern Ireland: Proportional Representation for Local Government Elections 
(GEN 79(72) 6) 
The four possible courses of action are summarised in paragraph 10. The attractions of the first of these - i. e. making no change for the purpose 
of the October elections are considerable; and Ministers may even think them decisive. Nevertheless, the memorandum makes a reasonable case on merits for some form of Proportional Representation in local government elections; and, even though PR may not in the event significantly benefit the more moderate political groups, the fact that they expect something from it in the way of breaking the polarity of opinion is not without a political significance of its own. 2. 
If so, however, the Committee will wish to consider two points:- 
(a) The possible impact (by way of precedent) on United Kingdom elections to the Parliament at Westminster. There can be no quarrel with the statement (in paragraph 7) that "if PR were adopted for elections to a central legislative body for Northern Ireland or for the election of the Northern Ireland members of the United Kingdom Parliament, it would be almost impossible to resist its use for the district council elections". Certainly, the dog may wag the tail. But what is now in question is the reverse 
- the tail wagging the dog; and it is perhaps open to question 
whether, if the use of PR in local elections in Northern Ireland extended to its use in the elections of Northern Ireland members of the Westminster Parliament, the process would necessarily stop there or whether new pressure would develop for its adoption for the election of all members of the United Kingdom Parliament. After all, we have said that one of our objectives is to ensure that Northern Ireland becomes a genuine part of the United Kingdom in the sense of being treated in all important respects in the same way as the other constituent parts. And it is surely doubtful whether the anomalous (and now annulled) precedent of the University seats provides grounds for supposing that we could retain our present practice as regards the method of election of the great majority of the members of the House of Commons but safely tolerate the use of PR for the election of the Northern Ireland representatives alone?

GEN 79: Northern Ireland The following are points which might be pursued under the customary 
headings of the security situation; the current political and economic situation; and long-term policy planning. A. 
The Security Situation (1) The Chief of the General Staff might be asked to give his usual report 
on the security situation, with particular reference to the weekend incidents of the explosion in Kelly’s Bar and the shooting on the "frontier" between the Ballymurphy and Springmartin districts of Belfast. (2) The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland might report on progress 
with the release of internees, with particular reference to the possibility (which he is considering) of a measure of accelerated release. There will still, however, remain the problem of the "hard core". (3) 
Following the renewed allegations of brutality by the security forces 
and the doubt surrounding the validity of a number of confessions, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was asked to put forward proposals (with a view to a decision at this meeting) about the desirability of allowing the forms of interrogation employed hitherto by the RUC Special Branch to continue. He might be invited to report on this. (4) At the meeting on 2nd May the Secretary of State was asked to put in 
hand a study of the legal sanctions which might be invoked against prominent members of the IRA from the Republic who might be arrested by the security forces. He might be invited to report on this also. B. 
The Current Political and Economic Situation 
(1) and (2) The Secretary of State is circulating a memorandum on the application of Proportional Representation to local government elections; and he intends to raise orally the question of the Border plebiscite. 
It 
might be convenient to deal with these subjects at this point in the agenda. Separate briefs will be coming forward. (3) The Lord President might be asked to report on the discussions 
which he is conducting, in consultation with the Chief Whip and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in order to create satisfactory machinery at Westminster for dealing with legislation about Northern Ireland. (4) 
If the Secretary of State has not, by Thursday afternoon, been able to 
announce the setting up of the Advisory Commission, he might be asked how this stands.

Note of a meeting held on 16th May 1972 
WEEKEND EVENTS 13TH-14TH MAY Mr Channon said, when answering a Private Notice Question on 15th May, 
that the Secretary of State would make a further statement on Thursday 18th May about the events of last weekend. The Secretary of State has said that he wants everything possible done to ensure that the Army’s account of those events comes to be accepted by all. At present, the press is divided about half and half. 2. 
The Corporal who witnessed the bomb explosion at Kelly’s Bar from an 
observation post is quite definite that the explosion occurred as the two men concerned were coming from Kelly’s Bar towards the car. There is to be a check on the suggestion that he had been warned to keep a lookout for a car answering the description of that involved in the incident. If the suggestion is confirmed it will help his account to prevail. 3. Both Mr Craig and Mr Fitt were aggressively interviewed last night on TV. 
The timing of shots after the explosion does not bear out Mr Fitt’s statement that Protestant militants were prepared for action immediately after the explosion at Kelly’s Bar. Although the disturbances following the explosion have been seen by some as marking a new phase of violence, the reaction to the Sandy Row bomb explosion yesterday was relatively slight. RUC advice had been followed in not taking down immediately barricades erected on Sunday, but all are now down. 4. 
The military lessons of the weekend events are three: that the IRA have 
re-inforced their military capacity; that the social climate in Northern Ireland is one of acute tension; and that the effectiveness, at least temporarily, of strong military intervention hasbeen demonstrated. 5. 
The suggestion is to be pursued that a duty officer should be at 
Stormont Castle at weekends. Although it should always be possible at weekends to contact a member of the Northern Ireland Office at the Culloden

A minor riot by 100 inmates of the Crumlin Road Gaol caused considerable damage to a basement workshop. 48 of the shooting incidents were in BELFAST and 12 in LONDONDERRY. In 2 of the LONDONDERRY incidents during a four hour period, over 500 rounds were fired from 3 schools on the edge of the BOGSIDE and CREGGAN, at the ROSEMOUNT RUC station. 
During the SAT/SUN (13/14 May) period there were 98 shooting incidents, 2 
explosions nd 2 armed robberies throughout the Province. 1 soldier and 4 civilians were killed and 2 soldiers and 60 civilians were wounded; Security Forces claimed to have hit 3 gunmen. 75 of the shooting incidents were in BELFAST and nearly half of these occurred in the BALLYMURPHY area after an explosion outside KELLY’s BAR. Details of this incident and the subsequent events are contained in paragraph 7 and the attached addendun. 
3. During the SUN/MON(14/15 May) period there were 76 shooting incidents and 1 explosion throughout the Province. A large bomb (230 lb) was successfully defused by ATO in NEWTOWNHAMHAMILTON. 
1 Soldier was slightly wounded and 3 
civilians were killed andeight wounded. These are the known casualties as at 150800hrs but there may well be others. Barricades were set up by Protestants and Catholics in several parts of the city but by dawn these had been removed. Because of the increasing number of shooting incidents from BALLYMURPHY(RC) into the SPRINGWARTIN(Prot) estate it was decided to mount an operation to drive a wedge between the Catholic and Protestant gunmen and to dominate the BALLYMURPHY area.

Addendum to Northern Ireland SITREP 12-15 May 72 
REPORT ON KELLYS BAR BOMB AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Introduction 1. 
At 1709 hrs on 13 May a soldier, a member of a foot patrol in 
the observation role on the slopes of Blackmountain overlooking BALLYMURPHY, saw a Morris 1100 park outside KELLYS BAR at the junction WHITEROCK/SPRINGFIELD Road. The two occupants got out and were seen to enter the bar. Approximately eight minutes later the two men left and as they approached the car it blew up. Other conflicting reports as to the events preceding the explosion are not corroborated by the sentry and could well be sectarian speculation. In the explosion 47 people were injured (7 seriously) and the surrounding premises severely damaged. 
The incident immediately 
sparked off a series of shootings, some against Security Forces, some inter-sectarian and others apparently internecine. 
Statistics 
2. During the period following the explosion 70 separate shooting incidents are recorded most of which occured in the BALLYMURPHY area or surrounding catholic enclaves. In 24 incidents Security Forces were not involved and on 44 occasions when fire was directed at the army, gunmen were engaged only 21 times. Approximately 700 rounds were returned in these engagements and 5 gunmen were reckoned to have been killed or wounded. 4 civilians killed and 10 wounded all as a result of gunfire. A further 47 were injured in the Kelly’s Bar explosion. 
Inter-Sectarian Involvement 3. 
One of the many rumours which were rife in the catholic areas 
after the explosion, claimed that the car bomb was parked by two young men who ran off. The immediate assumption was that the bomb was laid by Prtotestants. After the initial shock of the incident had abated the catholic reaction crystalised into violence including some hooliganism but mostly shouting. 
4. One of the earliest reported shooting incidents occured at 1808 hrs when gunfire was directed from the roof of St Bernadettes School into the Protestant SPRINGMRTIN Etate. This was followed almost immediately by high and low velocity fire into the BALLYMURPHY Estate from SPRINGMARTIN. 
5. At 1820hrs 2 or 3 gunmen were seen from HENRY TAGGART HALL in the area of SPRINGMARTIN Road (Protestant) and in a brief engagement one gunman was seen to fall. 
6. Thereafter there were only two apparently inter-sectarian shootings, though tension was high throughout the Protestant area. Barricades were erected on the est edge of the Shankhill and within the Springmartin Estate. On information, a joint patrol searched a house at 7 BLACKMARTIN Parade. Five Protestants were arrested and subsequently 2 were detained and charged with possession of 3 rifles and 1100 rounds of ammunition.

NOTE OF A MEETING 
Mr Johnston, Head of the RUC Special Branch, called on Lord Windlesham at the Minister’s request at 6 15 pm on 2 May. Also present at the meeting were Sir William Nield, Mr Woodfield and Mr Pilling. 
Lord Windlesham explained that in the Secretary of State’s absence he was being invited to sign a Detention Order for a prisoner whom the RUC thought should be interrogated for longer than the 48-hour period which they would otherwise have been limited to. Because of the strong recommendation made to him, Lord Windlesham intended to sign this Detention Order, but before doing so asked that Mr Johnston should explain to him the process of interrogation which the man was now likely to face. 
Mr Johnston explained that a prisoner under interrogation at a Police holding centre would be accommodated in a compartment in a large hut, one side of which was the wall of the hut, two sides of which were high partitions, the fourth side being open to the rest of the room: 
the 
prisoner was required to sit on a chair facing the hut wall. He was not allowed to stand up or to turn round. He would be taken from this compartment for interrogation by a team of one or more Special Branch officers at the discretion of those officers. No interrogation would be made until a preliminary medical examination had been completed. No prisoner would leave the holding centre until a further medical examina-tion had been made. During the interrogation it was a clearly understood rule that no form of physical contact should take place. The interrogation could involve threats, promises and inducements, but, Mr Johnston repeated, it was a clear rule that physical contact was not allowed. Mr Johnston pointed out that as with any organisation there might be cases where an individual did not conform to the rules, but he had made it plain to his Branch that a man who broke the rules would be accountable for the fact. 
When an admission was made during the course of interrogation, Special Branch called on the CID, would remove the prisoner to a Police Station and treat him there in strict accordance with the judges’ rules: statements would be taken, etc. A difficulty was now arising for the RUC in that the Courts were saying that such statements were not sufficient on their own. In addition to being satisfied that the statement had been taken under the judges’ rules, the Courts showed

MO. 19/3/6 
BGS(INT) DUS(ARMY) AUS(GS) 
PRIME MINISTER INTERROGATION - REVISED DIRECTIVE With his minute of 12th may, the Secretary of the 
Cabinet submitted to you the result of the JIC’s comprehensive review of the Directive governing interrogation by the Armed Forces in internal security operations. 
2. 
Directive should deal only with the general principles which should govern the conduct of interrogation 
- 
I agree with the JIC’s recommendation that the new and, 
in particular, with the safeguards that should apply - and 
that discussion of the detailed conduct of interrogation, including possible methods of questioning, should be left to a separate document which the Ministry of Defence would issue. 
3. As Sir Burke Trend says in his minute the new 
Directive was written with the possibility in mind that it might have to be published. As against this I would much prefer not to publish the new Directive. If we publish the Directive itself and not the more detailed supplementary Ministry of Defence instructions we may well call on ourselves a string of questions about the interpretation of the general directive. Some of these could be difficult to answer without disclosing the fact that other, more detailed instructions are issued and we should then be pressed to publish them. To publish one set of instructions and not the other could heighten suspicion about the latter. The objections to publishing the detailed instructions are in my opinion very great. You yourself in your reply to a supplementary question by Mr. Lyon on 2nd March said that you did not think that it would be possible or perhaps advisable that there should be issued as a public document any account of methods of interrogation which did not use the techniques that are now banned. I am quite sure that it would be better to take an unequivocal stand on this from the start and publish nothing. 
4. Copies of this minute go to the Home Secretary, the 
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Cabinet.

INTERROGATION BY THE RUC At the last meeting of GET 79, the Prime Minister asked 
that proposals should be drawn up, by the time the next meeting took place, regarding the future basis for the questioning of suspects by the RUC. In fact the Northern Ireland Secretary will not be in a position to make a definitive report at this evening’s meeting, since there has not yet been time for him to consult the Defence Secretary and the Attorney-General 
- let 
alone for exploring the ground with the RUC or the Northern Ireland Bench. However, Mr. Whitelaw is being provided with a speaking note reporting the tentative conclusions reached by officials at a meeting on 16 May, which BGS(Int) and I attended. A copy of this note is attached; Minister of State will no doubt wish to be aware of it before the meeting. 
2. In a nutshell, what is being suggested is as follows: a. 
- normally, of course, its CID - 
Where a suspect is being questioned in respect of some specific crime, the questioning by the RUC 
be strictly within the terms of the Judges Rules. (As the note explained, these Rules are themselves reasonably flexible.) This should minimise the risk of any admission made by the accused person, in the course of questioning, being declared inadmissable in subsequent Court proceedings against him. 
b. 
However, where i. 
the suspect is being held for 
questioning under the Special Powers Act, 
and ii. the Police consider that there is little hope of obtaining information from him if the questioning is
