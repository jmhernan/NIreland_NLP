NORTHERN IRELAND - REDEPLOYMENT 
1. You will remember that the Tac HQ and two batteries of 40 Fd Regt were redeployed from 8 de to 39 Bde on 27 Apr 73. General Ford in preparing his final directive reviewed the security situation generally. At that time Londonderry had been reasonably quiet and this allowed a slight reduction of force level (one company was replaced on the ground at the expense of 8 Bde reserve). On the other hand, and here he was reflecting CGS wishes, CLF was anxious to get on top of the remaining hard Catholic areas in Belfast, notably the Ardoyne and the Lower Falls, while he both had the forces available and also before any political pressure built up after the Assembly elections to ’lower the military profile’. 
2. This redeployment of most of 40 Fd Regt into the oodvale/Whiterock 
area of Belfast allowed an adjustment of boundaries in favour of 3 PARA (Ardoyne) and 1 GLOSTERS (Lower Falls) and achieved a highly satisfactory degree of attrition in these areas. At the same time there has been, coincidentally, an increase in Provisional IRA activity in Londonderry and an increased threat has been expected from them over the period of the Assembly election. 
3. The balance of argument has therefore swung slightly back the other 
way and with the roulement handover of 40 Fd Regt to 20 Med Regt CLF has decided to return to the previous deployment. The changes will take place on 23/24 June and involves an adjustment of boundaries again in Belfast and Londonderry.

PEACETIME STRUCTURE OF THE ARMY IN NORTHERN IRELAND INTRODUCTION 
BACKGROUND 1. 
The publication of HMG’s White Paper on the constitutional future 
of Northern Ireland did not provoke a significantly violent reaction, although the Provisional IRA and certain Protestant extremists have declared their opposition to its provisions. The Official IRA appear to be maintaining their concentration on political activity. There are encouraging signs that the majority of the community are tired of violence and keen to pursue their political aspirations by democratic processes. The elections are having the desired effect of concentrating attention on political action. 
2. It must now be hoped that there will be a gradual return to more 
peaceful conditions in Northern Ireland. The degree of normality which eventually exists will depend on many factors which it is not at this stage possible to predict accurately. These include: a. 
The policy and capability of extremist organizations. b. The ability of the RUC to assume full responsibility for 
law enforcement throughout the Province. c. 
Assembly and Executive. 
AIM 3. 
The successful establishment of a workable Northern Ireland The aim of this paper is to recommend a peacetime structure for the Army in Northern Ireland

GENERAL 1. 
a. The climate for the Northern Ireland Assembly Elections(MTAB) 
is likely to be similar to that of the Local Government Elections Which took place on 30 May 1973. However, because of the greater significance of the NIAE, the level of tension will inevitably be higher, with a correspondingly greater risk of any particular incident or terrorist act 
leading to an increased use of violence. b. 
No significant direct threat to the NIAE is foreseen, though 
attempts at intimidation can be expected. Whilst elements of the official IRA (OIRA) will be involved in campaigning for Republican Club candidates, the Provisional IRA (PIRA) is likely to try to attack soft and possibly eye catching targets at election time. Extreme Protestant groups may be expected to continue to perpetrate isolated outrages. 
c. In spite of the threat posed by extremist groups the outlook for 
the poll itself is bright. With virtually all political organisations now encouraging their supporters to use their voting papers rather than abstain, a high poll can be expected, possibly in the region of 80% of the electorate, inclusive of postal votes. 
OFFICIAL IRA/SINN FEIN 2. 
There are 10 Republican Club (and one Republican Labour) candidates for the 
NIAE and the more politically-minded of the OIRA will certainly be heavily involved campaigning on their behalf. Disillusionment with the Republican Club candidates in the LGE may lead some of the wilder elements among the OIRA, who are already discontented at their relative lack of action, into acts of local violence. One report has suggested that there might be some deliberate OIRA terrorist acts before the NIAE, but it is thought unlikely that there will be any fundamental change in OIRA tactics. Barring any general upsurge in violence, the OIRA leadership will probably stick to its "retaliation only" policy. 
PROVISIONAL IRA/SINN FEIN 3. 
The PIRA have only a negative interest in the NIAE. The comparative failure 
of the policy of intimidation, and the exposure of attempts by OIRA/Sinn Fein voters to gain votes by personating abstaining Provisional voters at the LGE, has led the Provisionals to advise their supporters to spoil their ballot papers rather than not participate. Given the present dominance of the PIR by Twomey and other Northern hard-liners, the present policy of violence seems bound to continue. Reports indicate that there may be attempts to escalate activity during the pre-election period. There is nothing to indicate that the PIRA will try to attack targets specifically connected with the elections. However, it would be consistent for them to attempt to draw attention away from politics by violent means, and possibly to attempt some form of spectacular attack to obtain maximum publicity. It is also possible, especially in Londonderry, that any planned series of anti-internment marches and demonstrations may be used to provoke incidents with SF.

ANNEX G TO 1021 G OP INSTR 5/73 DATED 
LEGAL POSITION OF SOLDIERS AT POLLING STATIONS, AT POLICY AND 
ACTION AGAINST PICKETING AND INTIMIDATION Action in polling Stations 1. 
Enter a polling station. b. 
The law for the NIAE provides that soldiers may: a. 
Remove from a polling station, by order of the presiding 
officer, a person who misconducts himself in the polling station or fails to obey the lawful orders of the presiding officer. 
2. 3. Soldiers are to enter a polling station only if the police are 
unable to carry out, or unable to carry out unaided, their duties at the polling station. 
The maintenance of order in a polling station is primarily the 
responsibility of the presiding officer, supported by the RUC. 4. 
they may: a. 
Where soldiers enter a polling station in support of the RUC, Arrest a person committing a breach of the peace or another 
serious offence to which soldiers’ normal powers of arresting persons red-handed apply. Where possible however such arrests should be made by the RUC. 
b. Remove from the polling station a person other than an 
offender under 4a above, who misconducts himself or who fails to obey the lawful order of the presiding officer, but only if the presiding officer orders it. 
5. 6. On no account are soldiers to take photographs in polling stations. If, in exceptional circumstances, soldiers make arrests as in 
paragraph 4a. the arrested person is to be handed over to the police as soon as possible via an RMP arrest team. 
Arrest Policy 7. 
Reference D applies, except that planned arrest operations are to be 
conducted only as specific and local responses in the event of terrorist outrages. Otherwise persons falling into the categories specified in paragraph 7 of reference D are to be arrested only if they are seen at large. If such persons are seen in the vicinity of polling stations they are, if circumstances permit, to be arrested after leaving the polling station rather than before casting their vote. 
Picketing and Intimidation at Polling Stations. 8.

The Taoiseach of the Irish Republic, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, 
accompanied by the Irish Ambassador in London, Dr. O’Sullivan, called on the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street on Monday 2 July 1973 at 1.00 p.m. 
The discussions began over a working lunch, and continued after lunch until shortly after 4.00 p.m. 
The Prime Minister referred to the recent election 
of Mr. Erskine Childers as President of the Irish Republic. Mr. Cosrave said that this election had not been a surprise to him. 
The coalition which formed the present government 
had been able to attract a majority of votes at the last election for the Dail, but it would have been difficult to assemble a comparable majority for a single man. 
He thought 
that Mr. Childers would make a good President. Over lunch, the main topic of discussion was the results 
of the elections for the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Prime 
Minister and the Taoiseach agreed that the outcome to be desired was that the official Unionists, led by Mr. Faulkner, should come together with the Alliance Party and the SDLP to form a coalition from which could be chosen an executive which would meet the requirements in the British Government’s White Paper. 
Mr. R.T. Armstrong was also present. The fact that extremists had on the whole been 
rejected in the election was encouraging; but the dissident loyalists had secured an uncomfortably large proportion of seats. The Prime Minister asked Mr. Cosgrave whether he thought it possible that,as some people had suggested, the dissident loyalists led by Mr. Craig and Mr. Paisley might come to an arrangement with the SDLP on the basis of a refusal to work the British Government’s constitutional proposals. Mr. Cosgrave thought it unlikely that either side would be prepared to go into a coalition with the other. 
Mr. Craig and Mr. Paisley 
had said that they would have no part in a power-sharing executive. 
the sort of line which the SDLP had been taking. 
Such a development seemed to be inconsistent with But the 
possibility could not be completely excluded; and he agreed that it was a disquieting possibility.

Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly (GEN 79(73) 16) 
In this report the Secretary of State briefly reviews the terrorist 
situation; comments on the results of the local elections; reflects on possible outcomes of the elections to the Assembly; and refers to the timetable of Northern Ireland legislation at present before Parliament. Terrorism 2. 
The IRA are considerably weakened but still capable of spasmodic 
violence. The Secretary of State will report on the recent increase in Protestant terrorist activity. You may wish to ask him whether this is likely to affect the chances of the one or two UDA men (e.g. Mr. Herron) who are standing in the Assembly elections, and whether Mr. Craig will be successful in preventing some of the obloquy from brushing off on his Party. The memorandum also refers to a campaign, already beginning, for the release of prisoners from the Maze. The Secretary of State is probably right in saying that "We cannot go on indefinitely increasing the number of people held". But what alternative does he suggest? And, more generally, does he see any real end to sectarian terrorism in the foreseeable future? If not, what are the chances that the new constitutional arrangements will even get off the ground? The Elections 3. 
The Secretary of State is surely right in warning his colleagues that 
the results of the local elections should not be taken as a reliable guide to the outcome of the elections to the Assembly. The recent JIC report on "The Irish Situation" (JIC(A)(73)(SA)(IR) 31 of 6th June) provides a very useful commentary on this subject. Perhaps its most significant sentence is the statement that "The vote as a whole, however, particularly among Protestants, demonstrated once again the defensive and sectarian nature of Northern Ireland politics". The Secretary of State may well be right, therefore, in predicting that, because many Protestant voters cast their second votes in favour of more extreme candidates, the Catholics (many of whom appear to have given their first vote to the Alliance Party, while many of those who voted for the SDLP did not give their second votes to Catholic extremists) may now follow the Protestant example and move outwards

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT 080700 TO 110700 HRS JUNE 1973 GENERAL 
1. There was a rather higher level of activity over the weekend than recently although much of this is accounted for in one series of Protestant inspired incidents in East Belfast on Sunday. There were a total of 44 shooting incidents in which SF were involved in 35 and 11 explosions compared with 17 (SF involved in 10) shooting incidents and 6 explosions last weekend. 
2. The Protestant terrorist activity appears to have been carefully staged and is linked with a much publicised and possibly contrived coup by the militants on the UDA inner council on Friday. The UDA are reported to have feared an arrest operation against them and that this militancy was designed as a demonstration of strength. The series of shooting incidents began on Sunday evening with shots at a VCP one of which killed the driver of a bus. Subsequently a gunman was hit and arrested and another was reported hit while a number of weapons were recovered in searches. 
3. Otherwise in Belfast there were 4 explosions on Friday and 2 on Saturday while in Londonderry on Saturday there were 2 bomb attacks, a rocket exploded on the fence of the Rosemount Police Station and injured 2 boys and there were 2 shooting incidents in one of which 2 civilians were seriously wounded. Border and rural areas were mainly quiet. There were a number of good arrests of Provisionals including 11 officers. 
4. In Dublin newspaper and radio reports have Martin McGuinness rousing a crowd of Provisional supporters with fight to the finish slogans. There appears to have been some violence involving the Police. Other newspaper reports over the weekend continue the "bring-the-boys-home" propaganda line.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 010700 TO 040700 HRS JUNE 1973 GENERAL 1. 
Against a backgound of very fe shooting incidents (17 in which SF were 
involved in 10) and 6 explosions; the more serious events stand out in contrast and received perhapsdisproportionate interest in the press. 
Of greatest note were a succession of disturbances in the Creggan and the 
Bogside of Londonderry on Sunday. The worst of these followed the dispersal of a peaceful anti-internment meeting in Guildhall Square when a crowd stoned and attacked the Gasworks location. 
A man and a woman were killed when two gunmen burst into a Protestant house 
in the Bone area of Belfast on Saturday. No motive has yet appeared for these murders. There was a single RPG7 rocket attack on a fuel installation at Aldergrove airport on Sunday. The rocket was fired from the main road and exploded against the chain link fence without significant damage. 
Sgt Drake, the fifth’ of the senior NCO’s involved in the car bomb explosion 
at Omagh; died in hospital. There was a suicide in the Maze Prison on Sunday an event which may spark off 
further anti-internment propaganda.

3. There was only 1 shooting incident but there were a number of incidents of hooliganism during the late afternoon and evening. The three Republican marches took place as planed converging on the Guildhall square from Brandywell, Creggan and Shantallov. 
The crowd was estimated at 1000 initially but soon 
dropped off to 400. The crowd dispersed peacefully after several speeches. After the meeting hooliganism began at the Gasworks SF location in the Bogside involving groups of up to 50 youths, some of whom attempted to tear down parts of the Army post with iron bars.

There were no shooting incidents. There was a rocket attack on the civil fuel tanker park at Aldergrove Airport - the rocket exploded on hitting 
the chain link fence but the rocket motor assembly carried on embedding itself in the cab of a tanker. This incident is reported in detail at Appendix 1. In Newry the propellant section of a RPG rocket was found 
- it is thought that 
this may have been connected with an explosion heard in the area on Saturday night. Loyalist marches in Lurgan, Aughnacloy and Killylea passed off peacefully. At HMP Maze Patrick Crawford (RC 22) was found hanged - 
the incident is being treated as suicide.

Appendix 1 to Annex C to A/BR/30/8/M04 Dated 4 June 1973 
RPG 7 ATTACK IN ALDERGROVE AIRPORT - INITIAL REPORT 1. At 2240 hrs on 3 June a single RPG 7 rocket was fired from the area of 
the garage at GR 156812, on the main road running est - East across the end of the ALDERGROVE Airport, at the civil fuel tanker park. The rocket exploded on hitting the chain line fence that surrounds the park, some 200-300 metres from the firing point. The rocket motor assembly carried on and embedded itself in the drivers cab of a fuel tanker, full of high octane fuel. The vehicle had just been parked. Three men standing about 10 feet from the vehicle escaped injury. 
2. The main airport buildings are some 500 metres from the fuel storage 
park, but in the general direction that the rocket was fired. 3. 
following contingency plans, but nothing was discovered. 4. 
VCPs were set up on roads around the airfield shortly after the incident, CATO visited the scene soon after the rocket was fired. He considers that 
it was a well aimed shot at the vehicle that was in fact struck, but that the firer either did not see the fence or did not appreciate the effect it would have on the rocket. While he was at the garage, where the firing point is thought to have been, he saw an aircraft take off from the airfield; he considers that it was within RPG 7 range of the garage while waiting at the end of the runay to take off. 
5. During the evening there had been no drop in the level of patrolling 
around the perimeter of the airfield. It is thought the firing point was well concealed in the yard of the garage which was closed and unattended at the time.
