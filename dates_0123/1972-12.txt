TEMPORARY REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITS FROM BAOR 1. 
Following up your minute (1) and our subsequent discussion 
on the question of passing instructions to the Ambassador and UKMILREP Brussels, MA/CDS and SCDS have agreed to copy CDS’s letter to SACEUR to UKMILREP and UKNMR SHAPE. 
2. When this letter has been despatched on Friday 15 December 
I intend to advise UKMILREP by signal that he will receive a copy on 18 December and should read this in conjunction with the telegram that I assume you are arranging for the FCO to send to the Ambassador. I should be grateful if I could see a copy of the draft telegram to assist in drafting my signal. 
3. I will ask UKMILREP to liaise with UKDEL and to pass 
appropriate information to the Chairman of the Military Committee in parallel with the Ambassador’s communication to the Secretary General.

TEMPORARY REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITS FROM BAOR 1. 
2. As I mentioned to you, I sent a copy of my minute of 
11 December to the FCO. I enquired yesterday whether they had any comments, particularly on the UN aspect. 
Mr Wiggin, told me last night that at first sight our ideas 
on timing and method of handling seemed acceptable but he had to consult elsewhere in the Department. He hoped, however, to give a firm reply in the course of today. 
3. 4. This means therefore that you should continue to defer 
action on my minute for the time being. This delay is not yet critical to our timetable. 
Meanwhile, I believe the letter to SACEUR could be improved 
by adding anew introductory paragraph; and a revised version of the whole letter is attached. There is also a small change in the penultimate paragraph to restrict precise dates to the first Cavalry unit to be used in this way.

C D Wiggin Esq CMO DFC AFC Foreign and Commonwealth Office 
December 1972 MEDIUM REGIMENTS RA AND IRISH CAVALRY REGIMENTS 
In Stephen’s absence, I am writing in reply to your letter of 5 December. 
We have been considering with DS12 what ought to be said in NATO Headquarters. Our conclusion is that there is no obligation under CM(55)82 to say anything about the artillery changes. These after all have been reported to NATO in the 1972 DPQ in the normal run of defence planning business, precisely as set out in that document. The overall effect of the restructuring of our artillery is a force improvement for NATO, and the failure to meet the 24 hour deployment role means only that it is marginally that much less good an improvement. It is arguable therefore that explaining this to SACEUR should be quite sufficient. 
As regards the changes affecting the two Irish regiments, again we only really are under an obligation to tell NATO when we know for certain that the effect of the deployment of one of them to Cyprus increases the overall number of major units away from BAOR. (NATO is primarily interested in the overall number, not in individual units). We will not know this for certain until nearer the time of the actual deployment. 
Strictly speaking therefore there is probably no obligation to tell NATO anything at this moment. Since however it is desirable for CDS to tell SACEUR of our proposals on the military net, we would avoid any possible criticism by saying something in NATO too. But for the reasons given above (with which DS12 agree) nothing more formal is needed that a letter from Sir Edward Peck to the Secretary General copied to his colleagues on the DPC. We will arrange therefore for UKDEL to be sent a copy of the letter CDS is being advised to send to SACEUR (draft attached). This letter will be

e are quite content with the draft letter you 2. As to timing this letter cannot be sent now until 
CDS returns from Brussels. Unless there is a particular reason for informing SACEUR in the near future, I would suggest that it would be preferable to send the letter in January when things in NATO are quiet.

1. MCCANN CALLED ME IN YESTERDAY AFTERNOON TO EXPRESS THE SERIOUS CONCERN OF THE IRISH GOVERNMENT AT THE BOMBING INCiDENTS IN BELTURBET, CLONES AND PETTIGO ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT. HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS WAS NOT A PROTEST, BUT THE IRISH GOVERNMENT WAS CONVINCED THAT THE BOMBERS CAME FROM NORTH OF THE BORDER AND AN EXTREME RIGHT-WING UNIONIST ORGANISATION WERE INVOLVED, 
2. THIS MORNING’S NEWSPAPERS STATE THAT A STRONG PROTEST WAS EXPECTED TO BE MADE. THE TAOISEACH MADE A STATEMENT LAST EVENING, SAYING: 
’’HAVING REGARD TO THE EVIDENCE NOW AVAILABLE, THAT THE CARS USED IN THE RECENT BOMBINGS NEAR THE BORDER WERE STOLEN ON THE. NORTHERN SIDE OF THE BORDER, THE GOVERNMENT HAVE MADE KNOWN TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT THEIR SERIOUS CONCERN AND HAVE URGED THEM TO TAKE ALL POSSIBLE STEPS TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF ANY SUCH ACTIVITY FROM ACROSS THE BORDER.’’ 
3. IT IS GENERALLY ASSUMED THAT THE BOMBINGS WERE THE WORK OF PROTESTANT EXTREISTS, PARTICULARLY AS CRAIG HAS PUBLICLY NOT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY AND HERRON HAS SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE THE WORK OF THE PROVISIONALS.

OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1.

been 145 shooting incidents of which only 46 involved SF (compared with 172/89 the week before. There have been 9 explosions compared with 18 the previous week. These decreases may in part be attributed to the Provisional IRA ’ceasefire’ which ran from midnight on Friday 22 December until midnight on Monday 25 December: however it is notable that there was no marked increase in violence afterwards as there has been following previous ceasefires. Only two people have died violent deaths this week.

NOTE 0F A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST PARTY HELD AT STORMONT CASTLE ON TUESDAY 19 DECEMBER 1972. 
Those Present:- 
Secretary of State A P McMaster 
Dr Paisley Rev William Beattie Mr John McQuoid Mr Samuel Robinson Councillor John Crowe Councillor Robert Donaldson 
Dr Paisley said that this is not a time for discussion about the future, the real issue at present is the survival of Northern Ireland as a community. Since Direct Rule there has been no significant change in the security situation. He would much rather therefore press hard for immediate action in the field of security than discuss the Green Paper. He believed that there will be a spate of murders in the near future and that the country is on the brink of anarchy, and called, therefore, for very firm actions to deal with the situation. 
The 
Secretary of State said that he was extremely worried about assassinations. Detection was proving difficult. 
He would probably be making a statement about 
legislation arising out of the Diplock Report but pointed out that laws are of no use if detection is missing. 
lack of information because witnesses are fearful. 
The low detection rate is probably a result of The Secretary of State 
said he believed that the Task Force which was recently introduced was already having an effect in East Belfast. 
He assured the deputation that strenuous efforts will continue, to remove the men of violence. 
Dr Paisley said that we are facing an emergency situation, a breed of compulsive killers is being raised, and to combat this drastic measures are needed. He therefore suggested that capital punishment should be brought in, not only for murder but for intent to kill (carrying guns, explosives etc illegally). 
He 
also suggested that mandatory sentences should be introduced because in several cases recently Judges had imposed a minimum sentence which, in his view, had only very slight deterrent effect. He also called for corporal punishment for young hooligans. In his view some leaders of the Protestant community are now preaching sedition, some Judges are cracking under the strain, and the time has arrived therefore to consider Military Courts. 
He appreciated that there is a shortage

NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NON ON 15 DECEMBER 
The report will be considered by GEN 79 on 18 December. The present intention is that it should be published on 20 or 21 December and that a statement should be put out to the effect that the Government accepts the report in principle. The Chairman said that legislation to implement the Diplock report would have to be seen in the context of the repeal of the Special Powers Act, and also of the constitutional proposals in the White Paper. 
In discussion, it was noted that the time taken to implement the Diplock report need have no direct bearing on the security situation, since the object of the report was mainly to 
replace and not to reinforce existing special powers. 2. Border Poll 
The Secretary of State has announced that the Poll will be held on 8 March and the draft Order has been laid. 
3. Assistance for the RUC 
Discussions are continuing between the Home Office and the RUC on the provision of detectives to strengthen the CID of the RUC 
4. Ministerial Directive to the Army 
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Secretary of State for Defence have agreed that a joint Ministerial Directive to the Army should not now be issued. 
5. Vehicle Documentation: Border Control (see paragraph 8 of minutes of 8 December) 
A further proposal for control of vehicles on the border is now being examined. It is proposed that under Regulation 33 of the Special Powers Act all vehicles using unapproved border roads should be required to have a permit. This would be similar to the concession pass system operated under Customs Regulations, vh ich for various reasons is less practicable to enforce. The proposed new system of permits is being cleared with Legal Adviser. A draft paper will then be circulated, with a view to a report being made to GEN 79. 
6. Mr Lynch’s Reaction to the Dossier 
Further instructions to Her Majesty’s Ambassador in Dublin are now being drafted and will be sent next week, asking HMA to seek more positive assurances from the Irish Government about co-operation by the Gardai and Irish Army over border incidents. 
7. Army Reaction to Provisional IRA Ceasefire 
It was noted that the Secretary of State for Defence had agreed the guidance proposed by Sir William Nield at the NIOM on 1 December (paragraph 3 of those minutes).

FORECAST OF EVENTS - WEEKEND 15 - 18 DECEMBER 1972 OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1. 
The week has been generally quiet although there have been a number 
of incidents which have found the headlines in the media. The IRA continue to use rocket launchers although there has not been a repetition of the coordinated attacks of 28 November; however this remains a possibility. Sectarian murders still give cause for concern although the task force set up to deal with them report some success. Hooliganism in Strabane is on the increase and local leaders there have asked for an increase in military representation.

C W Roberts Esq 10 Downing Street Whitehall SW1 
14 December 1972 
Thank you for your letter of 6 December in which you said that the Prime Minister assumes that we are checking what charges could effectively be brought in Northern Ireland against IRA leaders who are UK citizens by birth and who might take refuge in Great Britain. 
This is not properly a matter for Northern Ireland Office, but for the Attorney General’s department as it concerns prosecutions. We have, however, discussed the matter with that department and the answer is as follows:- 
i. If there is already an arrest warrant in Northern Ireland, it can be backed and executed by the police in Great Britain, and the person sent under escort to Northern Ireland. 
ii. If no warrant has been issued against that person, and if he is a known member of the Official or Provisional IRA, a charge could be brought against him in Northern Ireland under Regulation 24A of the Special Powers Act (being a member of an unlawful association). A warrant could then be issued for his arrest, and executed in Great Britain. The Attorney General’s office have asked us to make it clear that the decision to prosecute in each case under Regulation 24A must rest with him, as he must be satisfied that there is a reasonable chance of securing a conviction on that charge in a Northern Ireland Court. Subject, therefore, to the delay in the legal processes involved, and subject also to the Attorney General’s decision to prosecute, known IRA men of UK citizenship could be arrested and sent to Northern Ireland to face charges.

Northern Ireland 
- New Constitutional Arrangements (GEN 79(72) 29) 
At the last meeting the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was 
asked to circulate a memorandum on the possible outlines of a political solution in order to help Ministers to decide whether the publication of his White Paper should precede, or follow, the plebiscite on the Border. He has now confirmed separately that 8th March is the earliest possible date for the plebiscite; and it presumably follows, therefore, that the White Paper will precede the test of opinion about the Border. It would be useful to have this confirmed and to establish, if possible, a rather more precise timetable for the publication of the White Paper, since this will determine the pace of the work which has still to be done. There is clearly a good deal of it. 
In 
particular, the present memorandum contains no discussion in any depth of either the "Irish Dimension" or the nature of the powers which might be devolved to a Regional Assembly and Executive. Each of these is a critical issue; and Ministers will need to have a much clearer view on both of them before they can assess the kind of reception which the White Paper is likely to get. 2. 
Secretary of State’s proposal to tackle the problem by stages. 
To the extent that time permits, however, there is some merit in the In his present 
memorandum he seeks guidance on a number of other basic questions in order to assist further work, both within his Department and in outside consultations, with a view to the circulation early in the new year of a draft White Paper containing complete and firm proposals. The Committee can usefully discuss these questions, provided that it is understood that any provisional decisions may need to be reconsidered when the whole picture is available. 3. 
The Secretary of State envisages that the settlement must involve an 
appropriate devolution of powers to acceptable authorities in Northern Ireland; that these powers (largely unspecified for the moment) should be handed over gradually by the Secretary of State acting through Orders in Council at Westminster; that a preliminary to this transfer must be the establishment of competent and reliable authorities (which may create a "chicken and egg" problem in that competent and reliable individuals will want to know what sort of powers they will be allowed to exercise); that an increase in

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND SIR PATRICK MACRORY AT 3.45 PM ON WEDNESDAY 13 DECEMBER IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE’S OFFICE, GREAT GEORGE STREET 
The Secretary of State had an informal talk with Sir Patrick Macrory; Lord Windlesham was present. 
There was first a general discussion on the political situation in Northern Ireland with particular reference to reports that senior Westminster Unionist members were feeling increasingly out of sympathy with the Unionist Party. 
The Secretary of State said that he had found his most recent meeting with the Unionist Party very disappointing. He had made it clear that the constitutional arrangements would not give them all they wanted since their proposals would perpetuate one party rule in Northern Ireland. Mr Faulkner appeared to appreciate this argument better than the others. The meeting with the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) was also disappointing since they seemed determined to press their proposal for the establishment of a condominium in Northern Ireland. Both the Unionist Party and the SDLP had said in turn that if their proposals were not implement extremists would take control. 
Sir Patrick Macrory said that he saw four possible constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland. The first was to continue the present system of direct rule on the ground that it worked reasonably well. But it left a political vacuum in Northern Ireland which needed to be filled and did not provide an appropriate base for the reorganised local government. The second was a united Ireland. Many people regarded this as inevitable in the long term, but the time had not yet come and had in fact been put back by the violence. The third was to revive Stormont. This was not really practicable. Stormont had acquired a bad name which was not however entirely justified - Stormont might fairly be described, as it was by The Times, as having been reasonably humane and reasonably efficient. The fourth was a modified form of Stormont elected on the basis of proportional representation, which contrary to some statements was not in fact undemocratic, and with more members. This was the

Mr McDowall Mr Steele Mr Whalley 
THE SDLP’S GENERAL APPROACH 
The SDLP said that the basis of their proposals was to secure harmonisation and reconciliation. The two most important aspects of the proposals were the need to set up joint sovereignty for Northern Ireland and the need to secure an acceptable police force. They had with some difficulty come to the Conference Table but had done so in no spirit of submission. They were aware of the difficulty of balancing Protestant and the Catholic points of view; Equally they were aware that Catholics could no longer be treated as second class citizens. In this context Army harassment of the Catholic population was putting difficulties in the way of progress towards a political settlement. The threat from the Provisional IRA was not what it was. The Army should therefore act impartially between the two communities thus making it easier for the Catholic population to co-operate with the Government. They believed that the Secretary of State was aiming basically for a pragmatic settlement in the hope that he could win the common ground in the middle. It was also based on the immediate situation and thus any new settlement might not last, especially since non-sectarian parties had never flourished in Northern Ireland. 
It was important 
to realise that the publication of the White Paper might provoke a violent Protestant reaction; indeed, the continuation of violence seemed implicit in the proposals of the Unionist and Alliance Parties. It was a short-term solution merely to look at Northern Ireland as the basis for any settlement. A framework of reconciliation should be provided on the basis of absolute equality between the two communities. It was also important to remove the

Political objectives will never be reached in Northrn Ireland 
unless they are accompanied by full employment. Recent history has demonstrated again and again that because of a 
chronic unemployment problem Northern Ireland has always had rows and rows of rioters in reserve whenever trouble of a political nature was sparked off. 
It is no exaggeration to say that unless dramatic action is taken 
immediately by the Administration that the proposals in the White Paper will be rendered abortive by the very existence of this large scale unemployment. 
No real political settlement can be found unless favourable 
conditions are created by finding jobs for the numerous jobless people in the community. Unemployment figures over the years are a clear record which can be 
easily produced to sustain the thesis that political violence goes hand in hand with high unemployment. 
have fluctuated between 7% and over 10%. 
Since the war, figures for Northern Ireland In some regions it has stayed 
consistently above 20% and reflects most unfavourably against male workers. At present it is running at above 8% with no prospects of improvement. These figures have always been 4 and 5 times greater than for comparable areas in Britain and must be seen in the context of equally depressing statistics on lower average earnings, longer hours, higher cost of living and lower standard of living for people working and living in Northern Ireland against those published for other regions in Britain. Stormont policy for creating more jobs in the past was based on 
attracting outside industry to set up subsidiary firms and encouraging local employers of labour to expand their activities to produce more jobs. The policy which may have been inspired in the first place by narrow 
political considerations was never adequate to employment requirements. It arrested economic development West of the Bann and particularly in areas where non-unionist voters resided. 
It speeded up emigration and neglected 
to create opportunities for new graduates so sorely needed to implement real economic growth programmes. This policy was always under stress because of constant pressure

small family firms and more importantly When the crunch of the troubles came, 
the momentum for creating jobs based on the Unionist policy was non-existent and we witnessed at first hand an inflation of the number of combatants for the sole reason that they were available and had harboured a bitter social grievance in their hearts. In the fifties it was clear to be seen that Northern Ireland traditional industries were in decline.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND A DEPUTATION FROM THE ULSTER UNIONIST PARTY AT 2 30 PM ON 12 DECEMBER 1972 AT STORMONT CASTLE 
Present: 
The Secretary of State Mr Howell Mr McDowall Mr Stevens 
Mr A B D Faulkner Sir George Clark Mr Herbert Kirk Senator J L O Andrews Mr Robert Babington Mr J O Bailie 
The Secretary of State explained that, in these follow-up discussions to Darlington and the Paper for Discussion, he was basically intending to listen to the views of political parties and that any comments he gave would be his personal opinions only. 
LAW AND ORDER 
Mr Faulkner said that the position of his party remained as at Darlington and as explained in their Policy Document. Basically the Unionists felt that, in any new structure, control of the Police must remain with the Executive in Northern Ireland working through the Police Authority. They realised that, in the present circumstances with the Army in a proponderance, Westminster was entitled to control the security situation but, when things returned to normal and the Army presence was reduced, control must devolve back to Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State pointed out that there was a difference between administrative and operational control and, although he recognised there must be a Northern Ireland involvement in the former, he felt that, at least for the foreseeable future, operational control would properly remain at Westminster. The Secretary of State added that he did not rule out further talks with Mr Faulkner on this point. 
Mr Faulkner maintained that, in any settlement, a Northern Ireland Attorney General should be reinstated with responsibility for County Courts and Petty Sessions. The Secretary of State said that he noted this point. 
Mr Faulkner said that, prior to Direct Rule, his Government had a Joint Security Council, including officials from HMG. He considered that, in any future settlement, this Council should be re-constituted with Ministerial representation from Great Britain. The Secretary of State said that he noted this point.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND MEMBERS OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND COMMITTEE OF THE IRISH CONGRESS OF TRADE UNIONS AT STORMONT CASTLE ON TUESDAY, 12 DECEMBER 1972 
Present: 
The Secretary of State Minister of State (Mr Howell) Mr K McDowall Mr McMaster 
Mr N Kennedy JP (Chairman, NIC) 
Mr W J Blease Mr W Lindsay Mr R Allen Mr J H Binks Mr B G Harkin Mr E G Quigley 
Mr Kennedy said that’the Northern Ireland Committee (NIC) had discussed possible future administrative arrangements for a Northern Ireland Assembly but ’since his organisation embraces such a broad spectrum of political opinion it had not proved possible to reach a consensus which he could offer to the Secretary of State; however NIC were united in seeking sufficient employment opportunities and economic growth for the province. The Secretary of State said he was sure that it was largely accepted that there should be a considerable devolvement of power to an Assembly in Northern Ireland; however the real problem, which hasn’t yet been solved, is to decide on what type of executive should be created to use these powers. 
Mr Blease suggested that since NIC did not have anything to offer on this score the Secretary of State might like to hear the personal views of individual members. The Secretary of State said he would be glad to have views from whatever source. Mr Kennedy said he did not think that the Committee system would be satisfactory because ultimate power will rest with the majority party in the Assembly. Mr Binks said he would not like to see a structure which formalised the composition of committees, etc, on a religious basis within the administration. He thought that provisions for membership on a proportional basis, eg six Protestants to four Catholics, should be avoided at all costs. Mr Quigley considered that the normal concept of Cabinet Government could not be successfully operated in Northern Ireland. He suggested, therefore, that the establishment of separate units responsible for well-defined areas should be considered. Mr Lindsay said that people appointed to Government posts or by the Government to public bodies in the past had been branded with the stigma of

Northern Ireland - Contingency Planning (GEN 79(72) 28) 
This progress report from officials can conveniently be discussed 
at the GEN 79 Meeting on Thursday, 14th Decemoer. I think the discussion could be brief. 2. 
Officials have, as directed, been keeping under review the state 
of contingency planning for the drastic and comprehensive operation (FOLKLORE) whose implications were considered by Ministers in July before they decided to initiate the more limited Operation MOTORMAN. Ministers thought at that time that FOLKLORE should be considered only if the security situation had deteriorated to a point at which the Government were losing control of events. At present such a contingency remains hypothetical; and Ministers may therefore wish to endorse the suggestion that it would not be expedient at present either to widen unduly the circle of those concerned with FOLKLORE planning or to place further demands upon the time of Parliamentary Counsel. If so, officials will (apart from some further examination of the feasibility of planning for police reinforcement from Great Britain) confine themselves to regular reviews of the situation. 3. 
There is also, however, the contingency to which Ministers addressed 
themselves on 9th November (GEN 79(72) 36th Meeting). The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was then invited to consider, in consultation with the Defence Secretary, whether planning should be initiated against the possibility that the puolication of the Government’s final proposals in a White Paper might provoke disturbances on such a scale as to call their implementation into question. 
This is not quite the FOLKLORE situation; 
out, as the FOLKLORE planners themselves point out, it could contain a numoer of elements which are common to it. 
It is difficult to assess the 
likely post-White Paper situation until Ministers have further formulated their views on the content of the White Paper and its timing in relation to the Border poll. Within the next few weeks, however, the prospects should become clearer; and it would be right for the FOLKLORE planners to take account of these developments in their regular reviews. 
It might be desirable that Ministers should, on Thursday, give them a firm instruction

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 080700 TO 110700 HRS DECEMBER 1972 GENERAL 1. 
Security Situation. There was again no major change in the level of 
violence which remained low. On Friday/Saturday there were 30 shooting incidents (18 of them involving SF) and five explosions no explosions 
on Saturday/Sunday 24 (16) and on Sunday/Monday 21 (11) and three explosions: making a total 
for the three days of 75 shooting inicdents (45 involving SF) and eight explosions. The comparable figures for last weekend were 70 (42) and four. Casualties this weekend totalled one soldier killed as a result of the explosion of the rear portion of a 3.5 inch rocket which had been carried into a SF camp for investigation (plus one who died as a result of wounds received 6 December); eight wounded; and one civilian killed. There was one rocket attack when two rockets were fired at a SF sangar in Crossmaglen with no injury. Although there were more explosions this weekend most of them were minor. A second RPG 7 rocket launcher was found on Friday, this time in the New Lodge. There were no arrests of IRA officers, but useful civil arrests were made in connection with the tarring and feathering in Strabane on 27 November and with the murder of two soldiers of 4 Fd Regt on 7 August. A planned move of high risk prisoners to the Maze from Crumlin prison took place without incident. 
2. Press interest centred on speculation about Russian arms and the manner and 
extent of Russian support for the IRA. There was also interest in the outcome of the forthcoming Unionist Standing Committee meeting when an attempt will be made to expel the Vanguard movement from the party. There have been one or two articles in the press recently suggesting that Army morale is suffering as a result of the Ulster committment. The most serious was in the Evening Standard on Friday, but the Daily Mail story about purchased discharges in 2 PARA follow the same theme.

PUBLIC SECURITY: POINTS TO BE PUT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE BY THE N.I.L.P, 
- 11/12/72. 
1. We view with evr-increasing alarm the spate of assassinations taking place in Northern Ireland and the quantities of ars and ammunition now circulating within the Province in addition to those already captured by the Armed Forces. All this leads us to ask if greater scurity easures should not be iplemented at once. The general public hears little of the activities of the Police Authority or the Advisory Commission appointed by tho Secretary of State. There would seen to be a real need to create greater confidence in the public mind. We would ask if there is a sufficient awareness ’in high places’ of the sufferings being endured by the general public. 
2. We would sock to impress the urgent need to give public morale a boost and to use every possible means to restore normal conditions in those areas which have suffered most since 1969. We plead for a massive restoration of street lighting in every possible area, consistent to security requirements. The psychological effect of lighted streets would be a major restorer of frayed nerves, and this has, in most areas, the backing of Army Commanders. We would also plead for a speedy relaying of pavement surfaces 
- preferably with tarmacadam. 
3. Searching of houses does not seen to be carried out to a strict plan designed to cause the minimum of upset and disconfort and the maximum belief in the impartiality of the Security forces. Moreover there is at present evidence of the malicious use of the robotphone to provoke army searches of non-republican houses. We understand that at present the Army is under instructions to search all houses no matter how tenuous the information against them is. We would suggest that this rigid instruction be modified to permit the military authorities to consult intelligence reports rather than 
undertaking unnecessary and counter-productive arms searches. 
4. Correspondence with Government Ministers requires speeding up. There are increasing delays in getting replies from Ministers who have to make frequent visits to London. Northern Ireland M.Ps have been accustomed to a prompt service, and in the present uneasy state of the country quick replies can often ease burdens. 
5. There appears to be a need for much greater protection for householders and their families. 
Can existing legislation be enforced speedily to allow 
both Police and Armed Forces to break up any group of persons - three or more suspected of or likely to commit a nuisance or commit a breach of the peace. At present damage is done before action is taken an further intimidation is created with subsequent heart-breaking results. 
6. We would suggest that the subjects raised herein should be discussed fully with those active in society and who may be persuaded that greater co-operation with Government nd the forces of law and order could speed a return to more normal conditions in the towns and cities of the Province.

An NILP delegation led by Mr. F. V. Simpson, M.P. met the Secretary of State to-day at 12 noon. The delegation consisted oR Mr. Archie McArdle, (Chairman), Douglas McIldoon (Secretary)., Alderman W. Bodyd, Mrs. Margaret Holmes, Mr. Pat McHugh, Mr. B. Garrett (Vice-Chairman) and E. Holmes, (Organiser). The delegation took advantage of the opportunity to press on the Secretary of State the views of the Party on current security issues, but the discussion was mainly on the Party’s attitude to the future institutions of government for Northern Ireland. Dealing with the proposed White Paper the delegation laid particular emphasis on the need for the recognition of an Economic Dimension to the Northern Ireland problem. They warned the Secretary of State that the impending constitutional settleent would be no solution to the N.I. problem if the need for an Economic Dimension was not recognised and a major economic offensive launched to tackle the root cause of sectarian division. A programme to provide full employment, an adequate home for every family and a school building programme to provide nursery schools and smaller classes in the primary schools located in the working class areas of Belfast, Derry, Strabane and Newry, etc.. would do more to irradicate the 
recurring violence in our society than all the Constitutional engineering that Westminster night attempt.

NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NOON ON 8 DECEMBER 1. Border Poll 
The Secretary of State intends to announce on Thursday the date on which the Border Poll will be held. This will probably be 15 March. 
The question of which should come first - Border Poll or White Paper - will not be disclosed until a later date. 
2. Detention of Terrorists Order 
The Detention of Terrorists Order has been approved by the House of Lords. Lord Gardiner’s contribution to the debate has been particularly welcome. 
3. Diplock Commission 
Lord Diplock’s report has been presented to the Secretary of State. A submission has been put to the Prime Minister about the date of publication. 
The Secretary of State is particularly anxious that the report should not be available to anyone in Northern Ireland until Ministers have seen it. 
4. Rocket and Mortar Attacks 
The Secretary of State and the GOC have agreed that although the developments are serious not too much should be made publicly of the danger resulting from rocket and mortar attacks, and the skill of those using them. 
Representations are being made to the Russian Government through their Embassy in London seeking their co-operation in tracing the suppliers of the rockets to the IRA. 
5. Sectarian Murders 
The loan of detectives from police forces in Great Britain to the RUC is under discussion between the Home Office and the Chief Constable. HQNI have emphasised that the loan of 50 RMP to the RUC for the special task force will be difficult for them to sustain as it will mean taking RMP personnel away from other current priorities. 
6. The CGS Directive to GOC 
It was noted that the CGS would wish his directive to go to the GOC as soon as possible if the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland decides that a joint directive should not be issued. 
7. Mr Lynch’s reaction to the Dossier 
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office are not content with the terms of the understanding reached between HMA Dublin and Mr Lynch on the action to be taken

8 December 1972 Following conversations with you and the Northern 
Ireland Office this afternoon, I spoke to the Irish Ambassador on the lines described in my letter of 7 December, adding at the end the suggestion that, if the Irish Government wanted to go ahead on these lines, perhaps he would get in touch with Stewart Crawford during the course of next week about the modalities. 
The Ambassador was grateful. He said it was his 
Government’s understanding that any such meetings would be private and unpublicised. The fact that they were happening ould be known only to Mr. Lynch, Mr. Hillery, Mr. Colley and their Permanent Secretaries. 
Dr. O’Sullivan noted with great interest my statement e asked 
He clearly warmly welcomed this. 
that "We have been intending to go over the whole auestion of the settlement with the Irish in due course". 
whether that mean that eventual discussions about the Council of Ireland might broaden out. I said that we did indeed intend to go beyond the question of the Council, when our own consultations in Northern Ireland and our consideration of them was complete. 
The Ambassador said that Mr. Hillery and Mr. McCann 
would be in London on their way to Brussels this weekend, and he would be discussing the matter further with them before coming to see Stewart Crawford next week. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Terry Platt. (SGD) R.T. ARMSTRONG

Action in the Irish Republic The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1972 is now law in the Republic. Under it, a statement by a senior police officer that he believes an accused man to be a member of an illegal organisation will be accepted by a court as evidence that the accused mas such a member. 
A measure of this kind would not be justified by present circumstances in Great Britain, but there has naturally been speculation about the extent to which members of the IRA and other extremists may seek sanctuary here. 
Means of combat in the IRA in Great Britain The main defence of society against the IRA and violence of all kinds, must be a strong, well-equipped and efficient police force. The police take appropriate measures in relation to actual or potential IRA activity in Great Britain. The effectiveness of these measures would be jeopardised if details were made public. 
Citizens of the Irish Republic: powers to refuse admission and deport These powers are set out in the Annex to those notes. 
Execution in Great Britain of warrants of arrest issued in Ireland If a warrant of arrest has been issued for an offence in Northern Ireland against an individual who is in this country, including the offence under the Special Powers Act of being a member of the IRA, then that warrant can be backed and executed by the police in Great Britain. however, a gap in that there 
There is, are no effective powers-to deal with members 
of the IRA ho are our own citizens by birth (whether in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland) and against whom there is no Northern Ireland warrant

7 December, 1972 You wrote to Antony Acland on 6 December about the 
proposal that the Irish officials should visit London next week to discuss the Council of Ireland. 
Despite the fact that the Irish are now rushing in 
somewhat precipitately, it will be important in any reply to avoid the impression that we are going back upon the Prime Minister’s statement that "the British Government would be very ready to discuss what might be in the White Paper with the Irish Government" (page 7 of the Record of the meeting on 24 November). 
You may therefore wish to say:(a) 
The Irish will recognise that the sort of 
meetings they have in mind would demand very careful preparation and presentation. Ideally there should be no publicity either on the substance of the meetings or on the fact that they were taking place. They must in any case be so arranged that they bring maximum profit and avoid arousing ill-founded fears amongst Protestants in Northern Ireland. 
(b) The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland 
istill at the stage where he is conducting consultations with interested parties in Northern Ireland. Any Council of Ireland would have to he set in the context of the overall settlement for Northern Ireland. Indeed to discuss it outside this context would not be sensible. For this reason, although we recognise the Council of Ireland will be the point on which the Irish are most interested, it was out intention to go over the whole settlement in discussion with the Irish in due course. 
A meeting at this level at this stage, to discuss the Council of Ireland idea in detail, seems premature; we had assumed that such a meeting not taking place until after Christmas.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND A DEPUTATION FROM THE ULSTER LIBERAL PARTY, WEDNESDAY, 6 DECEMBER, AT 12 00 NOON AT STORMONT CASTLE 
Present: The Secretary of State 
Rev Albert McElroy Mr Berkley Farr Mrs Cowan Mr Wallace Perry Mr Rodney Smith Mr Tony Coghlan Mr Ivan Armstrong 
Mr Steele Mr Whalley 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE EXECUTIVE 
The Liberal Party deputation put forward the view that there should be a local Assembly in Northern Ireland which should not be called ’Parliament’. It should be elected on a proportional representation basis. The Executive formed out of the Assembly should function on a committee system with the chairmen of the various committees being elected, also on a proportional representation basis. The same electorate should be used for the Assembly as was used for local government elections in Northern Ireland. 
Security policy should be reserved to the British Government; in particular control of the Police should remain at Westminster for the timebeing, although the possibility of the return of some control over the Police to the Northern Ireland Assembly should not be ruled out. Any powers which were likely to be divisive in their operation should be retained at Westminster. 
The Secretary of State said he believed there would be a local Assembly in Northern Ireland. Integration within the United Kingdom had few friends and there was no real difficulty over the devolution of responsibilities. The difficulty arose out of the formation of the Executive from the Assembly. Since the Assembly would have considerable legislative powers, this basis could not be the same as the local authority basis.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND LEADERS OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH ON WEDNESDAY 6 DECEMBER 1972. 
Those present:- 
Rt Rev Dr R V A Lynas - Moderator Very Rev Dr Haire 
Rev Dr J W Orr Rev Dr A J Weir 
- Former Moderator - Moderator Designate - Clerk of Assembly 
The Secretary of State welcomed the deputation and explained the reasons for holding the series of discussions. 
Dr Lynas said that many people were very concerned about the security situation, the breakdown in law and order and also feared that the new assembly would be nothing like the old Stormont. As a result such people felt that this was the beginning of the end. 
If the new assembly was to be a watered down Stormont 
Dr Lynas expected that there would be a violent reaction on the Protestant side, it was difficult however to assess the likely strength of this reaction and the numbers of people who would be willing to resort to violent means. He suggested that the referendum and the White Paper should be presented as quite separate although he recognised that if the White Paper came first then the plebiscite would be regarded by many as a vote on its proposals. He had noticed in speaking to people throughout the Province that there was a tendency to think that the minority were getting more in terms of concessions than their numbers would justify. 
Dr eir thought that the Protestant community were in greater fear about what they saw as excessive appeasement than they were about the task of reconciliation. Many took the view that concessions had been made exclusively on the Unionist side in Northern Ireland, a willingness to change had also been shown both in Dublin and London; however, these movements had not been matched by any show of flexibility on the part of the representatives of the minority in Northern Ireland. As far as the Irish Dimension was concerned he suggested it was important that the elected representatives in the new Northern Ireland assembly should have sufficient standing to talk on the same footing as the political representatives in the Republic. It was very important that matters of mutual concern to North and South should be discussed on such a basis rather than between London and Dublin. He also wondered how the acceptability of the proposals in the White Paper could be measured. The Secretary of State said

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 050700 HRS TO 060700 HRS DECEMBER 1972 GENERAL 1. 
SF were involved in 14 of 29 shooting incidents (10/20 Belfast, -/1 
Londonderry 4/8 in rural areas). There were 4 rocket attacks (1 Belfast, 3 rural areas) and 3 home made mortar (2.5in) attacks (1 Londonderry, 2 Rural ). There were no explosions in the Province. Casualties totalled SF 2 killed, civilians 2 killed (1 murdered) and 3 wounded. 
BELFAST 2. 
In the 10 shooting incidents involving SF, fire was opened 4 times and 
returned 3 times. In one of these incidents in the Ardoyne a gunman fired one shot at the OP in Alliance Avenue, SF saw one man on the roof of 1 Berwick St, (vacant) and another in the first floor window. As they both appeared to be armed, one shot was fired at each. Later two bodies were recovered, they were: W J Bell 30 (PROT) 
- dead Stephen Kerney 23 (RC) - GSW to back 
Investigation discovered that they were bricking up the house,which is empty, on behalf of the Northern Ireland Housing Authority. It seems likely that they were removing lead piping to sell privately. In the New Lodge area at 1525hrs a rocket (RPG7) was fired 
at the new RUC station North Queen Street, it exploded 
causing some damage. In Ballymacarrott an unidentified hooded body of a man was found. At 2200hrs Thomas Forster (Prot) was admitted to Dundonald Hospital with GSW to both knees. 
LONDONDERRY 3. 
There was one shooting incident which did not involve SF. At 1822hrs at the 
Blighs Lane location an explosion occurred on the perimeter wire which turned out to be a mortar. In the follow up search the mortar on its base plate position and some bombs were found. The mortar (about 2.5in calibre) and the bombs were of local, but skilful, manufacture. While the base plate position was being investigated a crowd of about 400 gathered and attacked SF with stones. 68 baton rounds and 8 CS grenades were used to disperse them. 
BORDER AND RURAL AREAS 4. 
There were 8 shooting incidents of which 4 involved SF. At 1930hrs in 
Killeter near Castlederg Pte BOGLE, 6 UDR, was shot dead by gunmen while he was shopping with his family. There were 2 mortar attacks. In Killrea, Co, Londonderry 7 bombs were fired at the RUC station, 2 of which caused severe damage but no casualties. In the follow up an SMG, 30 empty cases and 8 AP rounds were found. In Lurgan two bombs were fired, but only travelled 8 yards, wounding the terrorist mortar crew who escaped. On investigation SF found the mortar on its base plate position with a bomb stuck in the muzzle. Sgt Hills, the ATO, tried to dislodge it with a rope but it dropped out, and exploded killing him instantly. (Both these mortars were of the same manufacture as that found in Londonderry) There were 3 rocket attacks. In Armagh 4 rockets were fired at the Worcester Valve Factory.2 rockets were accounted for. There were no SF casualties but a female patient in a nearby mental hospital was seriously injured by a fragment. In Coalisland 3 rockets were fired at SF investigating a bomb hoax but all three missed. At Coagh near Cookstown a rocket was fired at the RUC station but exploded on the perimeter wire without causing damage.

The passing by the Dail of the Offences Against the State 
(Amendment) Act 1972 has naturally given rise to speculation about the extent to which members of the I.R.A. and other extremists would seek sanctuary in this country. 
There are two problems. One, stopping I.R.A. members getting 
into Great Britain. Second, expelling those who get past our defences. There is no reason to suppose that the I.R.A. are planning any campaign of violence in Great Britain 
, but we certainly do not want Great 
Britain to become the haven for I.R.A. extremists that Southern Ireland has been hitherto. On the first point, although the Irish traffic is now being watched by the police at ports of entry, there is obviously a limit to the success which the police might have in picking out individuals without any advance intelligence, and we cannot put all the Irish traffic through an immigration control.

CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: POWERS TO REFUSE ADMISSION, AND DEPORT 
Until 31st December 1972 1. 
Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 as being contrary to the interests of national security. 
There is no right of appeal. 2. There is no power to deport an Irish citizen who has 
succeeded in entering unless he is convicted by a court of an offence punishable by imprisonment and is recommended for deportation. A recommendation cannot be made if he is ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for the preceding five years. 
3. But if a person is missed at the port the power to refuse him 
admission can be exercised if he is found within 28 days of entering and is then required to submit to examination by an immigration officer. 
After 1st January 1973 4. 
From 1st January 1973 the power to refuse leave to enter will 
be wider. It will no longer be restricted to grounds of national security, but can be exercised whenever it is not conducive to the public good to allow the person to enter the United Kingdom. There will be no right of appeal if the decision to deny entry on conducive grounds has been taken by the Home Secretary personally. 
5. From 1st January the power to deport will be wider. It will 
be possible to deport a citizen of Ireland on the ground that his presence in the United Kingdom is not conducive to the public good. Length of residence will no longer be a defence. (This extension of powers will not apply to a citizen of Ireland who has been continuously ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom since before 1st January.) 
6. Where the Home Secretary decides to deport a citizen of 
Ireland on not conducive grounds, there will be no right of appeal against the making of the deportation order if the basis of the decision is national security or political grounds. 
There will 
be a non statutory facility to make representations to three advisors, whose report the Home Secretary will have to consider before signing a deportation order. It is envisaged that the hearing would take place in camera. 
7. While there will be no right of appeal against the making of 
the deportation order, there will be a right of appeal if the citizen of Ireland objects to the country to which he is to be removed (Ireland). This appeal would be heard by the normal immigration appeal machinery, and such an appeal is unlikely to be successful unless the person concerned can show that a third country is prepared to accept him. A recent decision of the Court of Appeal confirms the view that on an appeal against the country of destination it is not open to the appellant to raise the issue of political asylum, and that the appeal is confined to the narrow point of whether he should be removed to the country named in the removal directions citizen. 
- almost invariably the country of which he is a 
Until 1st January 1973 admission can be refused under the Given advance intelligence this 
Dower of refusal can be exercised, and has been exercised in two cases in recent years.

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE NEW ULSTER MOVEMENT AT 5 PM ON TUESDAY 5 DECEMBER IN STORMONT CASTLE 
Present: Secretary of State Mr T C Platt 
Mr Brian Walker Mr Brian McGuigan Mr Cecil Hull Dr John White Mr Harry Stevenson 
The New Ulster Movement (NUM) presented the attached memoranda on the Paper for Discussion ("A") and on the border poll ("B"). They added that they had previously supported the view of the Unionist Party that responsibility for security should remain in Northern Ireland; but they now regarded this as a long-term aim and considered that in the short term responsibility should remain at Westminster. They expressed particular concern at the continued activity of the UDA and Tartan Gangs which was particularly bad in Lisburn, Lurgan, Portadown, Carrickfergus and was growing in for example Donaghadee. If the Secretary of State was unable to take positive action against the UDA and 
the Tartan Gangs because of a shortage of troops before the the Paper 
publication of the White Paper / would not be credible. They considered that the RUC especially should adopt a firmer attitude. In many areas the police appeared both unwilling and unable to act. The NUM could submit a memorandum setting out specific incidents. If something was not done to split off the extremist elements the Government would need plans to evacuate some half a million people who would not be prepared to stay in Northern Ireland for another year. 
The Secretary of State said that he was grateful for the memoranda presented by the NUM which he would study with care. He shared their concern about the UDA and the Tartan Gangs. The police had in fact already taken firm action and a number of charges had been brought. If the NUM submitted a memorandum he would be glad to arrange for the allegations to be investigated. There were in fact still some 18 battalions in Northern Ireland. Troops in Northern Ireland had to be rotated in the interests of efficiency and to ensure that additional battalions could be made available for specific occasions such as the plebiscite. 
The NUM said that they accepted that positive action was taken where possible to deal with specific cases of murder and other serious offences, but they were primarily concerned with what they

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND A DEPUTATION FROM THE ALLIANCE PARTY TUESDAY, 5 DECEMBER, AT 12 00 NOON AT STORMONT CASTLE 
Present: 
The Secretary of State Mr Raison 
Mr Phelim O’Neill MP Mr Tom Gormley MP Mr Cooper Mr Napier 
Mr Glass Mr Hendron Mr Cowdy 
Mr Steele Mr Whalley 
General Situation 
The deputation in their opening remarks put forward the view that nothing should be restored prematurely in Northern Ireland. No time-scale should be put on the restoration of normal institutions, which should be allowed to evolve as they were required rather than be statutorily restored. Two important points were that the White Paper should come before the plebiscite on the border and Westminster control in Northern Ireland should be strongly maintained. The Secretary of State should have considerable powers in any new settlement. For the immediate future he should make clear to the people of Northern Ireland where things stood; private armies should be resisted and the Protestant extremists withstood. The Secretary of State said that the Bill on the plebiscite would be made law this week. A decision on the date would be made as soon as possible, although there were administrative arrangements to be considered, and the problems of the introduction of the new Register on 15 February had to be resolved. He believed it was important to involve people as soon as possible in the democratic process otherwise a perpetual lack of responsibility would be bred into people. For this reason he hoped to hold the local government elections in April or May so that the new Councils could begin to operate in the autumn of 1973. As far as any elections for a new assembly were concerned, these would have to be either in the early summer or the early autumn. He believed that whatever arrangements were made for the future of Northern Ireland, there would have to

TIMING OF BORDER POLL At the last meeting of GEN 79 on 30 November it was agreed that I 
should as soon as possible complete my examination of the administrative factors governing the timing of the Border Poll. 
2. The various stages in a time-table leading to a Poll taking 
place on 31 January have been given most careful and detailed consideration by the Under Sheriffs and Electoral Registration Officers who will be responsible for the conduct of the Border Poll. 
3. Their unanimous conclusion is that they could not undertake 
with any degree of assurance to make the necessary arrangements for the efficient conduct of a Poll to be held as early as the end of January. 
4. The major administrative considerations which led to this view were:- 
a. insufficient time to process applications for, and to distribute postal votes in circumstances where the postal franchise was being extended in the light of reductions in the number of polling stations; 
b. the need to expedite preparations for the Poll during the same period as the staff involved would be committed to work in connection with the preparation of the new Electoral Register (for which a statutory publication date of 15 February is prescribed).

NOTE OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND A DEPUTATION FROM THE METHODIST CHURCH AT STORMONT CASTLE ON MONDAY, 4 DECEMBER, AT 12 15 PM 
Present: The Secretary of State 
Rev Edward R Lindsay Rev Dr Eric Gallagher Rev Frank Bolster 
Mr Whalley 
The deputation from the Methodist Church presented the Secretary of State with a memorandum (copy attached) which formed the basis for the meeting. They expressed their welcome for the Paper for Discussion and said that every effort should be made to encourage political parties, organisations and individuals to show constructive proposals. People should stand up and say that they had had enough violence and intimidation. It was encouraging that small groups were emerging all over Northern Ireland who were saying just this. These people should be brought out to express themselves before any final settlement was made. The Secretary of State said that he agreed with this philosophy but he pointed out how difficult it was to induce flexibility of approach into people’s thinking. It was essential that any settlement should last for more than two or three years and it was also important that Church leaders and other leaders in the community should encourage people to speak out in reasonable terms. He urged the Churches to do what they could in this respect. 
On the security situation, the Secretary of State said there was no doubt that the strength of the Provisional IRA had been considerably eroded with the result that they were coming to rely more and more on inexperienced members, at considerable risk to themselves. But as organised terrorism was cut down, sectarian murders increased. This was a worrying aspect of the current situation although detection was improving and public information via the robot ’phone was greatly improved. The Methodist Church deputation said that in their view there were no more CID officers in Belfast than there had been ten years previously. The longer the current disturbances went on, the more difficult would the task of the Police be. Police morale was very low. The

In my minute of November 21 on "Policy on the Border" I proposed that when you and the Foreign Secretary saw Mr Lynch you should give or arrange to give him an intelligence dossier on IRA crossborder activity, and offer the full co-operation of the Army, police and intelligence forces at all levels, to neutralise that activity. The minutes of your meeting with Mr Lynch record that you said "the security forces would be ready to co-operate with the Irish police and armed forces to whatever extent and in whatever way the Irish forces thought possible in order to reduce IRA cross-border activity". 
Mr Lynch apparently gave no definite reply to this proposition what follows appears to relate to future co-operation on political development. I have been considering how we might renew our proposals for full co-operation with the Republican authorities. But it would clearly not have been profitable to make any move until Mr Lynch was over the worst of the MacStiofain developments and until his new Bill had been approved, especially when these two situations were complicated by the Dublin bombs. At the same time we should not delay any longer than is necessary in seeking to introduce fuller co-operation now that Mr Lynch’s pressures on the IRA south of the border may drive the terrorists towards the border and perhaps even over it. 
I therefore suggest that we should now renew the proposals in my minute of November 21 and i. Arrange for the intelligence dossier to be handed over by Sir John Peck to Mr Lynch personally, together with the following representations.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FROM 010700 TO 040700 HRS DECEMBER 1972 GENERAL 1. 
Events in Dublin again dominated the weekend. The anti terrorism bill 
passed all its stages and became law on Sunday. Two car bombs on Friday in Dublin killed two and injured 147 others. These outrages have been denied by both IRA and UDA, but they rapidly polarised political opinion about the new laws. John Stephenson is said to be recovering and has added soup to his menu. 
2. violence remained low. 
The situation in the Province showed no major change. The level of On Fri/Sat there were 25 shooting incidents (13 of 
them involving SF) and no explosions; on Sat/Sun 20 (14) and 2 explosions; and on Sun/Mon 25 (15) and 2, making a total for the three days of 70 shooting incidents (42 of them involving SF) and 4 explosions. The comparable figures for the previous weekend, less the 60 shooting incidents in the prolonged Ardoyne gun battle, were 58 (36) and 7 and for the weekend before 59 (44) and 8 Casuatlies this weekend totalled two soldiers wounded ( 1 x UDR beaten 
up and 1 x regular VSI after a rocket attack), one RUC Sgt wounded, three civilians killed (all murdered) and seven injured. There were 2 rocket attacks, both in Belfast. The first, on Satruday, was against an RUC station but the missile struck the wall of a house past which it was fired and exploded harmlessly. The second, on Sunday, was fired at a packed Saracen on march control duties. It penetrated the front left hand side of the vehicle. Bursting fragments very seriously injured a soldier standing in the cupola. Two other soldiers were blown out of the back of the vehicle by the force of the explosion. The CESA/SINN FEIN marches in Belfast on Sunday went off peacefully. 
3. Ireland was back in the GB Sunday press headlines. Lost of the major 
comment concerned the passage and likely effect of the Dublin Government’s anti-terrorism measures. Specualtion about the origin of the bomb outrages in Dublin on Friday was rife but inconclusive. Monor comment covered the outbreak of rocket attacks, the continuing inter sectarian murders in Belfast, and Mr Wilsons’s constituency speech which was critical of HMG’s slow. progress in either disarming Protestant extremists or accelerating proposals for constitutional reform. The S Times and S Telegraph differed as to whether these remarks put the continuation of the bi-partisan policy at Westminster in doubt or not, and Mr Callaghan’s remarks on Sunday did nothing to clarify the clatter. The Observer carrie a candid profile of John Stephenson

2 December 1972 You will have seen telegram number 741 from Dublin. 
I think that our Ambassador in Dublin is right in being reluctant to go to Mr. Lynch with no more than the cata- 
logue of border incidents which the Prime Minister promised Mr. Lynch a week ago. 
from the Prime Minister to Mr. Lynch should go as far as the Ambassador suggests. I am sure that it is very important to avoid any appearance of "crowing" or sayi 
might, i read by somebody who was not at the talk with Mr. Lynch, be interpreted as thanking Mr. Lynch for complying with a request from the British Government. 
anything which And I wonder 
if it would be better not to start talking about the recent bombing incidents while we know so little about who was responsible for them. 
The Prime Minister does, however, think that in the 
new situation it will be very important for the security forces to be more than usually vigilant on the border. If the Republican Government uses the owers given to it by the new legislation they will be able to crack down on the I.R.A. in the Republic. 
certainly, therefore, make sense to renew the Prime Minister’s offer of full co-operation along the border in the new situation; and a message (perhaps a message delivered orally by the Ambassador rather than a written message) to that effect could well be accompanied by low key delivery of the papers which the Prime Minister promised Mr. Lynch. 
We ought to make sure that it is not. I am sending copies of this letter to Terry Platt and Robert Andrew.

NOTE OF A MEETING IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AT NOON ON FRIDAY 1 DECEMBER 1. Dates for Plebiscite ahd Publication of White Paper 
EN 79 considered on 30 November the range of options for the dates of the Plebiscite and the White Paper. No decision was taken as to which should come first. Administratively, it would be possible for the Northern Ireland Office to have the White Paper published in January, and before the Plebiscite. GEN 79 seemed reconciled to the fact that the administrative problems relating to the Plebiscite, coupled with the dead period of 15 February - 1March resulting from the new electoral roll, might well mean that it could not be held until March. The difficulties in getting Protestant extremists to accept this are recognised. 
2. Troop Reinforcements for Plebiscite and White Paper 
It was noted that the figures mentioned at NIOM on 24 November for the Plebiscite and the White Paper are not yet a basis for planning. Further, that it would probably be sufficient to have part of the reinforcement on a stand-by basis and not actually moved into Northern Ireland. 
3. Provisional IRA Ceasefire all. 
HMG’s position is quite clear. If the Provisional IRA want a ceasefire/they have to do is to cease fire. There is no question of any negotiations. Those claiming to be intermediaries will be told: "We will pass on to the Secretary of State what you say". 
If a ceasefire actually occurs, the profile to be adopted by the army will have to be considered in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time. In discussion the following points were made:- 
i. ii. iii. iv. 
A PNQ almost certainly be put down on the subject if a ceasefire occurred. The Press would probably ask what orders had been given to the army. The effectiveness of the ceasefire might vary from area to area. 
The IRA might give advance notice of their ceasefire, and step up the violence in the period before it. (as in July.) 
Sir William Nield summing up the discussion said that he would not be in favour of asking GEN 79 to make any decisions on the subject in advance; but that the policy should be left flexible and discretion given to the GOC to react initially as he thought best. Sir William Nield undertook to consult the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as to whether he agreed with this guidance, and thought Ministry of Defence might like to do likewise.

FORECAST OF EVENTS - WEEKEND 1 - 4 DECEMBER 1972 OPERATIONAL SUMMARY 1. 
The major gunbattle in the Ardoyne on 26 November which involved IRA 
and Protestant gunmen and SF, and the well co-ordinated series of rocket and shooting incidents on 28 November have overshadowed what has otherwise been a quint week. 
abuse shown to the SF and the sympathy shown by local people in Andersonstown to a soldier badly wounded in an explosion. 
Encouraging signs have been seen in the decrease in The imprisenment of 
Stephenson and his well publicised hunger and thirst strike have provoked surprisingly little reaction in the North, although a certain amount of hooliganism has been evident and there was a rally in Londonderry in protest.

Sir William Nield It was agreed at the Secretary of State’s morning meeting on Wednesday 
13th December that I should discuss further with the Army the exact wording of paragraphs 7(b) and 7(e) in the attached document. 2. 
On sneaking to the Chief of Staff I was surprised to find that there was 
still uncertainty in the Army about whether they wanted the new paragraph 7(e), as amended at the Secretary of State’s meeting, to be circulated now or to be held in reserve. They have discussed this among themselves and at the request of the RUC have come up with the slightly odd idea that the paragraph should not be circulated until, as they put it, "the dossiers are available". I do not understand what the relevance is of this but for the moment have merely agreed with the Chief of Staff that we will talk again about it when the dossiers are in fact available. The subject will no doubt come up when the "test case" is considered next week. 3. 
The Army would prefer to make a further amendment to the amendment which 
you proposed at the meeting and they now wish paragraph 7(e) to read as follows: "Other terrorists who are known on the strength of reliable 
intelligence, to be an exceptionally serious threat to security, and for whom, in the absence of evidence which could form the basis of a criminal charge, a strong case could be made for an interim custody order. The persons and categories to whom this applies will be specified from time to time." 
4. 5. I see no objection to this. I discussed further with the Chief of Staff the second sentence of 
paragraph 7(b). He explained that it had been included in the revised CLF directive on the grounds it reflected the instructions in the Secretary of State’s letter of 6th November in which he said: "In view of recent developments, Protestant terrorists may fall to be dealt with under the new order. It is not possible at the moment to define the categories which I will be prepared to consider for interim custody and for the time being I will consider applications in respect of them on their merits."

NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE ARREST POLICY FOR PROTESTANTS Reference: A. 
1113 G dated 9th December 1972. 
1. At the meeting at Stormont Castle on 1lth December, the GOC tabled a paper on Arrest Policy for Protestants, proposing a form of words to be incorporated in the Army’s arrest instructions in the event of a decision to widen tho arrest policy in respect of Protestant terrorists. Discussion was adjurned so that a further paper could be prepared showing where the additional form of words would fit into the existing arrest instructions. 
2. Attached is the relevant extract from the arrest instructions, 
corresponding to pages 1 - 2 of Annex B to CLF’s Directive 1104 G dated 7th December (of which the Northern Ireland Office has copies), but with an additional arrest category inserted as a new sub-paragraph 7 e. (sidelined). This sub-paragraph is not included in the current Directive. The words in square brackets would be included or not, depending upon whether it was desirable at the time to single out specific categories of terrorists, for example by naming certain organisations but not others.

ARREST POLICY (Paper by GOC) INTRODUCTION 1. 
This instruction is written in an effort to summarise the many letters 
and signals put out over the months on arrests,and to show how the soldier can use his powers of arrests in Northern Ireland in simple terms. A full instruction on this subject will shortly be promulgated and the present instruction provides guidance in the meantime on the main points. 
2. A soldier has the general powers of arrest enjoyed by every citizen under statute and common law. In addition the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 (referred to as the Special Powers Act or SPA) confers further powers of arrest on soldiers on duty. 
TYPES OF ARREST Red Handed Arrests 3. 
These are normally made under the general "citizen" powers where a 
soldier sees a person commit, or suspects on reasonable grounds that a person has just committed a breach of the peace or serious offence, e.g. assault, malicious damage, theft or possession of an offensive weapon. The soldier must tell the person in question why he is arresting him in the simplest possible terms, but he must include the word "arrest". 
Example ’A’. When a stone thrower is snatched, the arresting soldier could say "You’re under arrest for riotous behavious" or more simply "You’re under arrest for throwing stones". 
Example ’B’. Where a person is searched and a weapon is found upon him the words could be "I am arresting you for the unlawful possession of a firearm". 
Planned Arrests 4. 
These are normally made under the SPA powers. The degree of planning 
can vary between may days and a few minutes but it is most important that the formula on the Blue Card is used in every case; and it is as well to nominate the soldier who is to carry out the actual arrest and if possible to practise what he is to say beforehand. There is no reason why he should not read the arrest formula from his Blue Card whilst making the arrest.

Regulation 10. For the time being this Regulation is NOT to be used. 
When in use it applies only to the situation in which the RUC wish to interrogate a person and are using troops as their agents to effect the arrest. The authorisation to carry out the arrest must come from an officer of the RUC of the rank of Superintendent or above and should be in writing. The formula at paragraph 4 of the Blue Card must be used.

ARREST POLICY FOR PROTESTANTS (PAPER BY COC) 1. 
a. 
are to arrest, in addition to persons caught red-handed in the act of committing an offence, persons in the following categories:- 
The Army’s present arrest instructions provide that soldiers Anyone against whom there is known to be evidence 
to justify the preferring of criminal charges. b. 
c. d. e. Anyone against whom there is thought to be evidence 
which might, after questioning, justify the preferring of criminal charges. 
Anyone known to be holding officer rank in the 
Provisional IRA even though there is no evidence to justify criminal charges. 
Provisional IRA volunteers who, on the strength of 
reliable intelligence, are known to be an exceptionally serious threat to security. 
Anyone in the company of a person arrested "red- 
handed" if th arresting soldier suspects him of having committed or being about to commit an act prejudical to peace. 
2. From this it will be seen that arrests are linked to the prospect of bringing criminal charges, except in the case of categories c. and d. - 
ie. Provisional officers and certain 
volunteers. 3. 
The policy does not therefore provide for the arrest of 
Protestants or other non-Provisional terrorists except with the object of bringing a criminal charge. Protestants are not, as the policy stands, arrested with a view to their being made subject to Interim Custody Orders (ICOs) and brought before the Commissioners. The Secretary of State has indicated that in individual cases he will be prepared to consider on their merits applications for Interim Custody Orders in respect of Protestants, but such applications for Protestants will only arise where a person who at the time of arrest is thought to be criminally chargeable turns out during questioning not to be chargeable. 
4. Ministers have judged that the time is not at the moment 
ripe for an extension of the arrest policy in respect of Protestants. The object of this note is however to suggest a form of words which can be incorporated in the Arrest Policy Instructions when the time comes for such an extension. 
5. 
is very difficult to lay down precise criteria to define those Protestant terrorists who should be arrested. With the 
It 
exception of the UVF, Protestant extremist organisations are not in themselves illegal; it is not therefore possible to regard all those holding certain defined positions in Protestant organisations

Our 1104 G dated 27 July 1972.

SITUATION Background 1. 
In my Directive dated 27 Jul 72 (Reference ’A’) and 
promulgated by Internal Security Instruction 2/72 (Reference ’B’) I gave you the mission to establish a continuing presence in all hard areas in order to dominate the IRA and Protestant extremists and thus neutralise their ability to influence events. 
Although 
Phase 3 of Operation Motorman, the build up of intelligence and the removal of key terrorists from circulation, is still in 
progress, vigorous and successful action by the Security Forces has seriously reduced the IRA’s morale and made most encouraging inroads into their command structure. Neutralisation has not 
yet been achieved but great progress has been made. However, 
further political and military factors have emerged which together now necessitate the redefinition of the Army’s role and tasks for the future. 
New Factors 2. 
new factors is the reduction in force levels in December to 18 major units in the infantry role. 
From the military viewpoint, the most important of the In Belfast there will 
be enough troops to cover the hard Catholic areas and the interfaces but our presence in Protestant areas will be minimal. In Londonderry our presence in the Bogside and Creggan will be reduced so that hooliganism may well increase, particularly in the Creggan. 
In the rural area our presence will have to remain at a mere subsistence level with the result that 
public confidence, particularly in Fermanagh and possibly in Areas O and P, may be low and intimidation a major problem.
