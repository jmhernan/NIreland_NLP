Northern Ireland This morning’s Cabinet seemed to be moving towards agreement on 
four points:(a) The appointment of a separate Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. (b) A referendum on the Border. (c) A beginning of a phasing out of internment. (d) The transfer of law and order to Westminster. (a) was argued on merits; and it is probably true that it is something which could be done - and justified - regardless of whether there was a 
political initiative or not. But it is surely wrong to consider (b), (c) and (d) on the same plane 
i.e. as steps which should be taken irrespective of a political initiative. Thus, a referendum on the Border would be a "bonus" for the Protestants; and, as such, it should not be conceded except in return for an assurance of their co-operation in a programme of change designed to put them on equality with the rest of the United Kingdom of which they profess to wish to be an integral part. 
Similarly, a phasing out of internment would represent a 
major concession to the minority in the North and to Mr. Lynch in the South; and it is therefore essentially a bargaining card, which should not be played except in return for counter concessions in the wider political context. Rather different considerations apply to a transfer of law and order to 
Westminster. Even if it were reluctantly accepted by Mr. Faulkner, it would still leave responsibility awkwardly divided between Westminster and Stormont since, although Westminster would gain control of the security forces, Stormont would still retain such functions as housing, education, etc.; and it is these which are often the occasion for the grievances with which the security forces have to deal. And, if the transfer were not accepted by Mr. Faulkner, the progression to direct rule would be almost inevitable and very swift. Either way, therefore, the transfer of law and order alone is a half-way house, at which it would be difficult to stop for long.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 92 7 MARCH 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours There was another major explosion in Belfast. A stolen van Was 
parked on a piece of waste land behind a cinema near the city centre during the afternoon, with a bomb inside it which is estimated to have contained between 40 and 60 lbs of explosive. The ensuing explosion caused injuries, fortunately all fairly minor 
- to about 
56 civilians, most of them passers-by who were struck by flying glass and debris. Half an hour earlier the cinema had been evacuated after a telephone call alleging that there was a bomb in the building 
- but 
a search then had revealed nothing, and it is believed that the van containing the bomb was not in the car park at the time. One other explosion in Belfast caused some damage to the Co-operative Society’s premises. 2. In Londonderry a large bomb of 40 or 50 lbs was placed in the Ardowen Hotel in Northland Road by three armed youths, who gave about 25 minutes warnin that it was due to go off. The explosion badly damaged the hotel 
- the second to be attacked in Londonderry in this 
way. (Report No. 76, paragraph 3 refers.) were 
3. There/eight outbreaks of shooting, all in Belfast. In one of 
them a young man of 19 was shot and wounded in the Falls Road area by a gunman who then made off in a car. A UDR soldier who was attack in his home by two armed intruders fought back and managed to put them to flight. As they ran off he fired a shotgun after thorn three times; he thought that they fired back at him but he was not hit. 4. 
There were five armed robberies during the period, three of them 
in Belfast and the other two in Co. Armagh. 5. 
Hooligan activity in Londonderry appears to have retrned to its former level, after a brief respite of three days at the end of last

Cabinet: Northern Ireland The papers before the Cabinet will be the Home Secretary’s 
memorandum CP(72) 26; the Confidential Annex recording the Cabinet’s discussion last Thursday; and the two letters from Mr. Faulkner on political reform. Ministers have been warned of the great sensitivity of these papers; and you may like to re-emphasise this point, in view of the current spate of speculation and apparent "leaks" and the opportunity which these provide for political mischief-making. 2. 
ask the following questions:(1) 
The simplest way of organising the Cabinet’s discussion might be to Is it agreed that the Government must launch some political initiative 
now, i.e. without waiting any longer? The Cabinet may not have much difficulty in saying "Yes". If they hesitate to do so, they must face the question "What is the alternative?". 
In other words they must say whether 
they believe - particularly after the incident in the Belfast restaurant - that there is any real future in continuing to work for a purely "military" solution. And they must also say whether they believe that Mr. Faulkner’s two letters suggest, by both their content and their style, that political concession limited to his proposals offers any hope of restoring peace and stability in the longer term. Even so, those letters have been carefully drafted, with one eye to eventual publication; and they naturally prompt the question "Why are the Government not content with the counter proposals of the Northern Ireland Government? And why do they think it necessary to go further?". The true answer is neither short nor simple; but the Cabinet might be asked whether they agree that the essence of it is that the history of 50 years has shown that it is not politically acceptable that power should be exercised by Stormont while responsibility, at times of crisis, has to be shouldered by Westminster. (2) 
If there is to be a new political initiative by the United Kingdom 
Government, is the Home Secretary’s proposal on the right lines? Its elements are:(i) Plebiscite on the Border in the near future, followed by a second plebiscite in 15-20 years. 
(ii) In the long term, Community Government: minority groups in Parliament represented in the Cabinet as of right; law and order transferred to Westminster.

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland I have had a "nuts and bolts" meeting this afternoon with the 
Departments mainly concerned; and the attached note lists the points on which decisions are now required urgently if we are to launch our initiative at the end of this week or very early next week. 2. Some of the points, particularly as regards the Bill, are issues 
of political judgment on which we can only ask for Ministerial direction. For the rest, action on the administrative questions is already in hand and has probably been carried about as far as it can be until we know more about the appointment of a new Secretary of State and are in a position to approach the Governor, the Civil Service and the Police on the basis of a firm decision by the Government to launch the initiative. 3. 
Inevitably, therefore, a good deal will have to be done very rapidly 
at the last minute. But I thought that you might like to see this list before tomorrow’s Cabinet; anddepending on the outcome of that discussion, it would be convenient if the small Ministerial group could meet briefly (perhaps tomorrow evening) to dispose of as many of the points as can be settled at this stage.

FOLLOWING IS FULL TEXT OF SPEECH BY TAOISEACH TO A FIANNA FAIL PARTY MEETING IN SOUTH DUBLIN OF 3 MARCH. 
BEGINS. 
THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS DURING THE PAST FEW MONTHS, BUT MORE ESPECIALLY IN RECENT DAYS, TO DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE POLITICAL MORASS WHICH IS NORTHERN IRELAND BY ATTEMPTING TO BLAME OTHERS FOR THE COONDITION THAT EXISTS THERE. THIS USUALLY TAKES THE LINE OF SUGGESTING THAT THE IRA IS THE CHIEF OR ONLY CAUSE OF THE BREAKDOWN OF SOCIETY IN THE NORTH AND THAT IT ORIGINATES AND IS SUSTAINED FROM THE SOUTH. ACCORDING TO MR. FAULKNER, THE IRA IN THE NORTH WOULD BE RUN INTO THE GROUND IN NEXTTO NO TIME IF THE AUTHORITIES HERE TOOK THE RIGHT ACTION. 
VIOLENCE IT IS SAD AND DISTASTEFUL, IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF YET FURTHER DREADFUL KILLINGS IN THE NORTH, THAT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH POLITICAL ATTACKS OF THIS KIND BUT THIS LATEST ASTONISHING PERFORMANCE BY MR. FAULKNER LEAVES ME NO OPTION. NOBODY WHO KNOWS ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT AFFAIRS IN THE SIX COUNTIES COULD POSSIBLY BELIEVE, AT THIS STAGE, THAT THE VIOLENCE IN BELFAST OR DERRY IS TO ANY APPRECIABLE EXTENT SUSTAINED OR ORGANISED FROM THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY. MR. FAULKNER DOES NOT BELIEVE IT BUT HE HAS TO GO THROUGH THE MOTION OF SAYING THIS KIND OF THING TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM STORMONT’S CONTINUING FAILURES.

SECRET TO PRIORITY HONE OFFICE TELNO 044 OF 04 MARCH FOLLOWING FOR WOODFIELD 1. HAVING HEARD THAT BRIAN MORTON, THE CHAIRAN OF THE LONDONDERRY COMMISSION, WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE COMMISSION CONTINUING TO DO A WORTHWHILE JOB IN PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WAS CCNSIDERING WITHDRAWAL FROM IT THIS MONTH, TOGETHER WITH HIS COLLEAGUES, I INVITED HIM TO COME TO SEE ME YESTERDAY. 2. HE CONFIRMED THAT LIFE WAS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR THE COMMISSION. THERE WERE STAFF PROBLEMS ARISING PARTLY FROM THE GENERAL SITUATION IN LONDONDERRY AND PARTLY FROM THE FACT THAT MEMBERS OF THE STAFF DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEIR FUTURE WOULD BE AND WERE BEGINNING TO LOOK AROUND FOR OTHER EMPLOYMENT IN CASE THEY SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN ON BY THE LOCAL OR CENTRAL AUTHORITIES WHEN THE COMMISSION COMES TO AN END NEXT YEAR. SPEAKING PERSONALLY HE WAS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT SPENDING ANOTHER YEAR ON THE JOB UNLESS SOME PEAL CHANGE IN THE POLITICAL CLIMATE ENABLED THE COMMISSION TO DO A PROPER JOB. HE FOUND HIS DEALINGS WITH MR BRADFORD UNSATISFACTORY. THE TERM OF APPOINTMENT OF THE COMMISSIONERS RAN OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY. BRADFORD WANTED THE FIVE PROTESTANTS TO STAY ON BUT ALSO WANTED TO FILL THE FOUR PLACES FROM WHICH CATHOLICS HAD WITHDRAWN, AND SAID THAT HE WAS SURE HE COULD FIND OTHER CATHOLICS TO SERVE. MORTON TOLD HIM THAT IF HE PURSUED THAT INTENTION HE WOULD PULL OUT FORTHWITH, AND HIS COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMIISSION TOOK THE SAME LINE. BRADFORD THEN CLIMBED DOWN BUT THE PROTESTANT MEMBERS AGREED ONLY TO REMAIN UNTIL THE END OF MARCH, WHEN THEY 
WOULD RECONSIDER THEIR POSITION. MORTON TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN URGED BY THE CHURCH LEADERS AND BY A NUMBER OF OTHERS IN LONDONDERRY TO CONTINUE TO SERVE. I TOLD HIM THAT I HOPED THAT HE WOULD HEED THEIR PLEAS, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE A VERY BAD EFFECT IN LONDONDERRY AND ELSEWHERE IF THEY WERE TO GIVE UP. HE SAID THAT ON REFLECTION HE WOULD TELL BRADFORD THAT THEY WOULD STAY FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS. THAT WOULD TAKE THEM UP TO THE LOCAL ELECTIONS, DUE TO BE HELD IN OCTOBER. THEY WOULD THEN THINK AGAIN ABOUT CONTINUING UNTIL THE COMMISSION WAS WOUND UP.

3rd March, 1972. NORTHERN IRELAND: INTERNMENT Your letter of 29th February to Robert Andrew recorded 
the informal meeting which the Prime Minister had with the Defence Secretary and the CGS after GEN 47 on 28th February. There is one point in it on which you would probably like our comments - the extent to which the Army had information which would enable them to say with confidence that those interned were members of the IRA. 
The information on which recommendations for internment 
are made by the RUC Special Branch is naturally held by the Special Branch themselves. 
But a senior Army intelligence 
officer has always had complete access to these records; and he is satisfied that, subject to two reservations, virtually all the internees are IRA members. 
The first is that three 
of the internees cannot be assigned to specific appointments in the IRA’s order of battle, though the dossiers concerned show that the Special Branch regard two of them as members of the IRA and the third as having strong links with the IRA. The other reservation is that one cannot entirely rule out the possibility that in a few cases the information provided to the Special Branch might have been prompted by personal spite, 
or something similar, on the part of the informants. I am sending a copy of the letter to Brian Norbury.

Ulster, Solutions? (Note by the Central Policy Review Staff) 
There is now total incompatibility between the aims of the two sides in Northern Ireland. So long as their quarrel was about how far the Protestants should monopolise politicial power in the province, there was some hope of compromise. Theoretically at least, the Protestants could have been persuaded to accept a degree of Catholic participation which might have satisfied the Catholics. But the events of the past few months have made it certain that the quarrel now is about whether the province should remain part of the UK. The Protestants are determined that it should. The Catholics, supported by the great majority of southern Irishmen, are determined that it should not. 
2. It is hard to imagine any compromise being possible on this 
issue, although the elusive idea of a genuine condominium is examined below. In the absence of compromise, one or other side is going to have to accept defeat. Unless an acceptable political process can be found for deciding by peaceful means which side is to be regarded as victor, it seems certain that the decision will have to be a violent one. 
3. 
This suggests that there are broadly three types of outcome: i. 
Victory of one side at the end of a period of violence long and decisive enough to convince the other side that it has lost. 
ii. 
Victory of one side as the result of some political process the verdict of which would be acceptable to the other side. 
iii. 
Acceptance by both sides of a position short of victory for either, i.e. a situation in which the province was neither fully detached from the UK nor fully restrained from unity with the Republic. 
PRESENT POLICY 
Victory through violence 4. 
Our present view is that Northern Ireland should remain part 
of the UK until the majority of its electorate decide otherwise (which no one honestly supposes that they ever will). We are

The Rt Hon Edward Heath MBE MP Prime Minister 10 Downing Street LONDON SW1 
1 March 1972 
1. In my letter of 16 February, I promised that we would let you have our views on certain matters which you raised at our meeting on 4 February, as well as on means of participation alternative to any form of "community Government" and other safeguards of minority rights. While there are aspects of detail to which we would wish to give further thought, we have nevertheless taken our discussions sufficiently far to allow me to place our broad general views before you at this stage. 
2. The primary objective of any series of proposals likely to bring about a stable and enduring political settlement must be to achieve for the institutions of Government in Northern Ireland a general concensus, binding all sections of its population other than unreasonable and irreconcilable elements committed to the use of force. It has to be acknowledged that, however far-reaching, imaginative and generous any proposals may be, there is likely to remain an irreducible minimum of such elements, against whom the lawful forces of authority will have to act with total firmness. 
3. It is to the achievement of such a concensus that the search for an "active, permanent and guaranteed role" must be directed. It also has to be acknowledged that the attitude of important sections of the minority in Northern Ireland will inevitably be influenced by the future position and actions of Government and responsible opinion in the Irish Republic. The chances of the minority co-operating realistically in the good government of Northrn Ireland will be much enhanced if the constitutional framework and governmental institutions are

MEMORANDUM BY THE PRIME MINISTER AS MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS ON INTERNMENT 1. 
There has been considerable speculation in the press about the possibility 
of ending internment, and when I met Mr Heath on 4 February 1972 I has asked whether I saw any early prospects of its being phased out. 
I replied that I 
shared the view of the Army that it was vital to get on top of the IRA before making any move in this direction. 2. 
In spite of the continued bombings and shootings there is ample evidence 
that the effectiveness of the IRA,especially in the Belfast area where the security forces have recently concentrated their efforts, has been very seriously reduced. 
The removal from circulation of 700 - 800 members of the 
two main organizations is creating increasing problems for them in terms both of morale and losses of key personnel. 
made good, but the officers of some companies have had to be replaced two or three times over and volunteers are now reluctant to come forard. 
in Belfast have ceased to exist and others have been amalgamatod. 
areas have been completely cleared of IRA and increasing pressure is being brought to bear on areas where groups are still active. 3. 
technical skill in the use of explosives. These losses have to some extent been 
Some units Several 
In Belfast the IRA are particularly short of leadership, experience and Taking the situation in Northern 
Ireland as a whole, about 140 important members on the wanted list are now in the Irish Republic. 
The severe dislocation of command and communication systems 
has left behind something more in the nature of a cell structure, and operations are largely carried out by small active service units, many of them based in the South. 
It must be added that these are capable of inflicting casualties 
on the security forces and of maintaining limited attacks on civilian targets for some time to come, especially outside Belfast. 4. 
There are two answers to the claim that internment has not worked. 
The first is the fact, already noted, that the IRA presence has been removed from certain areas and that this is continuing; though it is unfortunately true that those who have most to fear from the IRA are least articulate in pointing to the comparative freedom from intimidation which they are beginning to enjoy. 
Secondly, insofar as internment has not yet succeeded, this is due in no small measure to the fact that there are many people outside the IRA who do not want it to work. 
They include those who while ostensibly deploring the methods of 
the IRA have little desire to see the IRA put out of action until some at least of the organization’s aims have been achieved. 
5. in IRA recruitment. 
There is little evidence that internment has led to a substantial increase On the contrary, recent arrests indicate that most of 
those taking part in terrorist attacks were recruited in the period leading up to August of last year. 
So far as those already interned are concerned, the

lst March, 1972 Northern Ireland Ministers will wish to have with them at this afternoon’s meeting on 
Northern Ireland (at 4.00 pm) two pieces of paper further to those I circulated yesterday: 
(1) a draft of a Northern Ireland (Transfer of Powers) Bill; and 
(2) a note by the Home Office Legal Adviser concerned with the possible interregnum between an announcement of proposed constitutional changes, and the enactment of a Direct Rule Bill. 
Copies of (1) and (2) are attached. I am sending copies of this letter, with the attachments, to 
Johnny Graham, Alan Bailey, Leonard Davies and Robert Andrew; to Sir Philip Allen; and to Peter Gregson.

Interregnum between announcement of proposed 
constitutional changes and enactment of direct rule Bill Note by the Home Office Legal Adviser 
I have discussed with Sir John Fiennes the legal position in 
regard to the carrying on of government in Northern Ireland in the two situations which officials have been asked to consider, i.e. (i) where the N.I. Prime Minister, when told of the U.K. Government’s proposals, refused to cooperate and refused to resign his office; 
(ii) where the Prime Minister and all the members of his ministry resigned. 
2. In either event it is assumed there would be an immediate U.K. 
Government statement about the position and the intention to introduce direct rule legislation. In the circumstances it is unlikely that there would be any alternative Prime Minister who would be able to form an effective ministry. 3. 
In the first situation, it would, as a matter of law, be open to 
the Governor (who would no doubt in practice consult U.K. Ministers informally) to dismiss the Prime Minister and any other N.I. Minister who refused to resign. The power of the Governor to dismiss flows from section 8 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 which states expressly that N.I. Ministers, who are either officers appointed by the Governor to administer a N.I. government department or other persons appointed by the Governor, hold office during the pleasure of the Governor. 4. 
Although there is no precedent in the U.K. for the dismissal of a Minister except on the Prime Minister’s advice, and none for the

Northern Ireland At this afternoon’s meeting Ministers will have before them:- 
(a) The Home Secretary’s memorandum (GEN 79(72) 3). (b) The draft of a Bill transferring only the law and order function to Westminster. 
(c) The draft of a Bill to institute direct rule. (d) A note by the Home Office Legal Adviser about the feasibility of "Governor’s Rule" in the interregnum between the introduction and the enactment of the legislation instituting direct rule. 
(e) Possible timetables for the introduction of direct rule and/or Commission Government (GEN 79(72) 2). 
It might be convenient to take the items in the above order. But the 
meeting should perhaps begin with a report from the Home Secretary about the new proposals which Mr. Faulkner is said to be hatching. 
He is 
being very elusive this morning; but the Home Secretary will try to make contact with him before our meeting and discover what he has in mind. On the assumption that his proposals will be inadequate, the meeting can then proceed to:(a) The Home Secretary’s Memorandum This provides a comprehensive description of the whole package of 
measures, comprising an interim period (? two years) of direct rule and/or Commission Government, which would be used to work out the final solution. As such, it could well be the basis of a submission to Cabinet in the near future. But it appears to differ from the line which Ministers have hitherto been taking in two respects; and it is perhaps deficient in one further particular. The points at which it seems to differ from earlier thinking are as 
follows:(i) It suggests that in the interim period of Commission Government Stormont should not be dissolved but only prorogued. There could clearly be political attractions in this variant, at least so far as the Protestants are concerned. On the other hand, it might alienate the Catholics in so far as it might be thought to foreshadow the retention of a Stormont system in the ultimate solution. (And is it, in any event, legally and constitutionally permissible?).

Northern Ireland Before we resume the discussion tomorrow morning, 
you may like to see the attached note which we have just received from the Ministry of Defence about the timetable of troop movements if it were judged necessary to despatch the reinforcements indicated in the Annex to GEN 79(72) 1.

The time-scale for building up the force level in Northern 
Ireland, in the event of direct rule, to the maximum level described in paragraph 1 of the annex to GEN 79(72)1 depends on two factors. These are, first, the lapse of time between when the units are warned for moving and when they are ready to move (ie the notice at which they can be placed); and, secondly, the time in transit to Northern Ireland (which depends primarily on the availability of air and sea transport for immediate use). Planning had previously been based on the premise that the extra units would move after seven days’ notice - which the GOC considered sufficient on purely military grounds. However, this could be shortened to the extent described below if it were thought desirable for the first units to arrive more quickly than that. 2. 
Once a unit as a whole has been warned for moving, it is 
inevitably only a few hours before the fact becomes public. Thus it would not be practicable to warn units for moving in a direct rule context until the decision that direct rule was being introduced had been announced. It would however be possible to give discreet warning to the commanding officers of the units involved and this would in itself help to reduce the period of notice 
- especially 
in the case of units serving in BAOR - to not less than 48 hours from the time of the announcement (up to 24 hours’ more notice than this being required just before or during a week-end).

P Gregson Esq No 10 Downing Street London SW1. 
As a supplement to Philip Allen’s letter to Robert Armstrong of today’s date about the transfer of law and order from Stormont to Westminster, you may like to have the attached note showing that the Northern Ireland Government without responsibility for law and order would not be reduced to the status of a mere county council. 
I am sending a copy of this letter and the attached note to Burke Trend. P J Woodfield.

The following notes indicate the nature and range of functions which will be left to the Stormont Government if responsibility for law and order is taken away from them. Many of the functions are governmental and would not, and could not, be performed by a local authority in Great Britain. In addition, when the Northern Ireland local government reforms are complete, Stormont will have many responsibilities which will belong to first tier local authorities in this country. A comparison of Northern Ireland Departments and United Kingdom Departments is given in the Schedule. 
2. The Northern Ireland Government has much wider functions than the Secretaries of State for Scotland or Wales and a considerable measure of independence and discretion although Northern Ireland Departments may not pursue completely independent policies. For example, social security benefits must be the same as those in Great Britain and the level of incentives to industry are fixed in relation to those in Great Britain; in other cases, lack of resources make it desirable for Northern Ireland broadly to follow the pattern set in Great Britain. (Their Companies Acts, for example, closely follow ours). 
3. The independence of the Northern Ireland Government in governmental matters is reflected in the present financial arrangements. Under these, most taxes affecting Northern Ireland including income tax, customs, excise

14th March 1972 I write to express the deep concern which my 
colleagues of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party and I feel at the rapidly deteriorating position in Northern Ireland. 
As you are no doubt aware, this Party as the 
principal Opposition Party and alternative Government has always stood for the rule of law and the suppression of illegal organisations. The situation in Northern Ireland now is clearly critical. Any postponement of political action, or the introduction of inadequate changes may create a situation of the most serious kind resulting in an uncontrollable conflict. I must, therefore, urgently impress upon you the 
critical importance of taking immediate political action to ensure the establishment in Northern Ireland of an impartial representative administration in which all sections of the people can have confidence. This is not the time to propose long-term policies, 
but it is imperative to get elected representatives to the conference table where alone a solution can be found to this grave situation which threatens to engulf the whole of Ireland and endanger Anglo-Irish relations.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 101 20 MARCH 1972 
Incidents in the last 72 hours The two large rallies of the weekend - 
by the Ulster Vanguard on Saturday and by the Catholics on Sunday - have been fully reported 
in the Press. Army observers estimated that 51,000 people attended the former and 11,000 the latter. Each took place in an area of Belfast well clear of the other community’s residential areas, and each was well controlled by its stewards, so that the scope for confrontations was thus minimal; and fears that there might be trouble around Ballymacarratt or the Unity Flats as the Protestants made their way home on Saturday evening were fortunately not borne out. A check is still being made on whether there were any attempts by those attending the Vanguard rally to form processions afterwards; first indications are that there is little foundation for the centrepage report in the ’Guardian’ that a procession formed in Templemore Avenue. Sunday’s participants certainly did stage an illegal march, but the RUC deemed it wisest not to intervene at the time. 2. 
Former members of the B Specials (USC) were prominent on 
Saturday, forming up in ranks at the rally in Ormeau Park. One television report mentioned that there were 800 of them. 3. 
There was a fair amount of terrorist activity during the weekend, 
including 47 shooting incidents, 14 explosions and 13 border incidents. Eleven soldiers and a policeman received injuries varying from serious to slight. 4. 
Five of the military casualties were the outcome of shooting 
incidents in Londonderry (one on Friday and four on Saturday) and two in Belfast (one on Friday and one on Saturday, with one civilian being injured on each of these days as well). A gunman is believed to have been hit in an exchange of fire in londonderry on Sunday. There was one instance of firing cross the border on Friday, at

Northern Ireland The main points to be dealt with tomorrow morning seem to be as 
follows:(1) 
The Law and Order Bill. A new draft has been circulated today 
in which Sir John Fiennes has had a shot at an alternative version of Clause 3 distinguishing the IRA by name. It is better than its predecessor; but, in so far as it still provides for the proscription of "any other organisation", it remains unattractive from the Parliamentary point of view. Ministers will need to decide whether the Clause is to be included at all, and, if it is, whether its present form is acceptable. They will also need to confirm their provisional view that the definition of law and order in Clause 1 is also acceptable. (2) Your brief for the meeting with Mr. Faulkner. I am sending this 
forward separately under cover of a note drawing attention to several points in the "speaking notes" which are still unclear or undecided. (3) The check list for action. 
This, too, is coming forward separately 
(and is being circulated to most of the other Ministers present tomorrow). It suggests that our preparations are as ready as they can be for a wholly unpredictable situation; but, inevitably, a good deal will have to be left to last minute improvisation according to the way the cat jumps. The main points for Ministers to consider are perhaps as follows:(a) You will be seeing the Governor tomorrow evening before Mr. Faulkner arrives. It might be convenient if he could arrange to remain unobtrusively in London until Wednesday’s meeting is over. 
(b) Until the meeting with Mr. Faulkner has taken place we presumably cannot form a final view about the timing of legislation in relation to the Budget debate and the Easter Recess. But the Lord President may need to raise the point at Cabinet on Thursday and, possibly, be ready to say something about it in the Business Statement that afternoon. 
(c) 
It will be necessary to make some public statement after the meeting with Mr. Faulkner about Her Majesty’s Government’s intentions in the light of that discussion. 
This may have to be confined to a 
purely "holding" statement if Mr. Faulkner returns to Belfast for further consultations with his colleagues. 
In that case it could

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
Northern Ireland Administrative Contingency Plans: Check List We have considered the administrative action which may be 
required by reference to three hypotheses:A. 
B. C. 
That Mr. Faulkner acquiesces in our taking law and order and continues a "benevolent" administration. 
That he declares his intention of resigning if we take law and order. 
That he actively opposes the transfer of law and order, declares that he will not resign and faces us with the obstacle of a government which purports to continue in office. Any of these three hypotheses may be complicated by:- 
(i) A stipulation by Mr. Faulkner that he must return to Stormont and consult his colleagues before reaching a decision. 
(ii) A refusal by his colleagues - or by extreme Protestant opinion outside the Cabinet - to acquiesce in whatever decision Mr. Faulkner reaches. 
But any complication of this kind would probably be a matter of 
timing rather than substance. The Governor On hypothesis A. there is no special action for the Governor to take. 
On B. he will have to abstain from appointing a new Prime Minister until the United Kingdom Government have taken a final decision. 
If this decision 
is to introduce a direct rule Bill, the question how long the Governor could hold the position depends on circumstances; but we have the Governor’s Powers Bill ready in case of need. On C. if Mr. Faulkner’s continued administration was inimical to the general good as we see it, he would have to be dismissed from office. While the Governor could do this under prerogative powers, it might be better to invoke the Governor’s Powers Bill. The Governor needs to have instructions on all these matters. You will wish to see him, if possible, before Mr. Faulkner arrives; and, since he is due to be in London tomorrow evening, this may be feasible.

17 March, 1972 In your letter of 16 March you asked about the 
doctrine of "hot pursuit" by our troops across the Irish Border. 
This question is linked with cross-Border shooting 
incidents. At the moment, when British troops are fired on from across the Border, either by an individual who flees into the Irish Republic after a pursuit begun in Northern Ireland, or by anyone else, fire can be returned by the British soldiers if they are obliged to do so for their personal self-defence. Should we be taxed upon this (e.g. in the United Nations) we have the argument which we believe to be sound, though it is certainly not to be found in legal textbooks, that the soldiers, when firing back, were exercising personal selfdefence in a manner which was lawful under the law of Northern Ireland (and presumably also under the law of the Irish Republic) and which thus being inherently lawful did not affect relations at the inter-state level. 
A wholly new situation would arise if the British 
forces were to take the positive step of crossing the border in "hot pursuit". This could no longer be regarded as individuals exercising the right of personal self-defence. It would be a deliberate incursion into Irish territory by official British forces for which an international legal justification would have to be found. The justification would have to be the right of self-defence. 
There are precedents in international law for making 
incursions of this kind in order to prevent a raid. In. the "Caroline" incident in 1837, British forces from Canada entered the US in order to capture and destroy a vessel intended to carry raiders into Canada. It was then recognised that a claim of self-defence was justified in such a case provided that Great Britain could show a "necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation". But we do not believe that this is the kind of case to which the present enquiry relates. 
In the view of the UK, every Government has the duty to prevent its territory being used as a base for armed

NORTHER IRELAND - MR FAULKNER’S LETTERS OF 16th FEBRUARY AND 1st MARCH 
INTRODUCTION 1. 
Mr Faulkner’s proposals consist of the following:(a) his Green Paper with certain additions; (b) periodic referenda on the border, though in some important respects on a different basis from our ideas; 
(c) a solemn and binding agreement by the Republic to recognise the Government of Northern Ireland leading to 
(d) 
a common policy North and South on the suppression of illegal organizations and if this is agreed 
(e) a joint Irish Inter-Government Council with equal members from the Governments in the North and South as a form for discussion of economic and social questions; 
(f) a willingness to accept the enactment, presumably at Westminster, of a Bill of Rights. 
2. 
Specifically rejected are:(a) any place in Government for representatives of the minority community as of right; 
(b) the transfer of "law and order" powers to Westminster; (c) any change, while the violence continues, in the policy of internment; 
(d) the transfer to the Republic of any part of Northern Ireland. 
GREEN PAPER 3. 
The following additions to the Green Paper proposals are offered:(a) an extension of the role of functional committees to include law and order as well as other matters; 
(b) an additional power allowing the committees, subject to safeguards, to originate their own proposals on policy.

POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF THE IRISH REPUBLIC 
Restrictions on Entry We could stop, for the future, Irish citizens coming to Great 
Britain to take jobs, which at present they do to the number of 25, 000 a year (excluding seasonal workers). 
(We have not considered the 
possibility of extruding Irish citizens already here.) The United Kingdom and the Irish Republic have since 1962 
formed a Common Travel Area and no control is exercised over travel within the Area. Abolishing this arrangement would cause hardship to the Irish as it could reduce very considerably the number of Irish citizens entering the United Kingdom for employment. Citizens of the Republic are already in theory subject to the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, and this could be made so in fact by applying its provisions to them at points of arrival in Great Britain. The Home Office, without having made precise estimates, consider that this could involve the employment of about 60 extra immigration officers. 
Controls, to be effective, would also have to cover the land 
frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic (unless the alternative in paragraph 5 is preferred). 
This would require the making of an Order 
in Council under section 3(4) of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962; under section 3(5) of the same Act the draft would first have to be laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House. As a preliminary estimate the Home Office have suggested that 200 immigration officers would be required to control the existing official crossing points. This does not touch the problem of the many unofficial and uncontrolled crossing points. The very considerable difficulties of effectively sealing the Border have already been discussed in the military context. 
An alternative to sealing the Border would be to institute 
immigration controls for all persons entering Great Britain from Northern Ireland as well as from the Republic. 
This was in fact done during 
World War II and continued until 1951. Such a measure would probably be the only effective way of controlling immigration from the Irish Republic, but would involve the employment of further numbers of immigration officers and would have the following further drawbacks: 
a. 
It would require a fresh Act of Parliament before citizens of Northern Ireland could be subjected to immigration control in Great Britain. 
b. 
It would doubtless cause resentment in Northern Ireland; Mr Faulkner was not well disposed to an earlier proposal that identity cards should be given to Northern Ireland residents for the purposes of control of the land border.

17 March, 1972 The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has 
read the draft Bill on Northern Ireland and has asked me to pass on his views, as follows :" I have read the Northern Ireland (Law and Order) 
Bill. I have only one question : Is it necessary to take such wide powers in Section 3 to proscribe the IRA? The more particular this can be the better. 
I cannot judge whether the House of Commons would 
pass the Bill quickly. The Chief Whip and Lord President would have a much better idea. But I think this package is the least we can do if we move at all. The Prime Min ster knows that my concern is that if we have to go for prorogation we should not wait around endlessly for political talks to solve the matter. If we do we shall be landed in perpetuity with direct rule. I would rather, than let disagreement run, impose our political solution, require a General Election on it and restore a Stormont as fast as possible. Even a glorified GLC would be some buffer but I would hope for something better than that. 
I am sending a copy of this letter to Norbury 
(Cabinet Office), Davies (Lord President’s Office) and Angel (Home Office).

NORE FOR THE RECORD 
Sir Harold Black telephoned me today to say that he wanted to add to his conversation this morning with Sir Burks Trend in which he had been told that the purpose of the discussions with Mr Faulkner on 22 March would be to go over the whole ground. 
Sir Harold said that he wanted us to be clear that in the absenee of any advance information about specific proposals it would not be possible for Mr Faulkner to agree to anything at the meeting which went beyond what he had proposed in his letters to the Prime Minister. Sir Harold thought that this would be the ease whether or not Mr Faulkner decided to bring some of his colleagues with him. Z think this position of Mr Faulkner’s is inherent in what he said in his conversation with the Prime Minister over the telephone yesterday.

Sir Harold Black rang me up at 10. 00 am this morning to ask whether 
I could give him any indication of the area of discussion when Mr. Faulkner visits the Prime Minister next Wednesday. I said that I did not think that I could be any more specific than the Prime Minister himself when he had said to Mr. Faulkner on the previous evening that what he had in mind was a good "going over the ground". Sir Harold Black said that he understood that. But Mr. Faulkner 
had of course to consider his own position with his colleagues; and it would therefore help him to know at least how the discussion might be related to his most recent letter to the Prime Minister. Could he be given any indication whether the proposals in that letter were broadly acceptable; whether the discussion would be confined to those proposals; or whether it would be liable to go further? I confined myself to replying that I did not think that the Prime Minister was approaching the meeting with anything quite so specific in his mind. He wanted to talk the whole thing out and - to repeat - to have a good "going over the ground". 
This brought the conversation to an end! 16th March, 1972

NOT FOR RELEASE BEFORE 6.P.M. WEDNESDAY, MARCH, 15. PRESS RELEASE. 
FROM: MR. NORMAN ST. JOHN-STEVAS. M.P. The Government initiative in Northern Ireland. 
Speaking to a meeting of the Cities of London and Westminster Conservative Association at The Hyde Park Hotel in London on Wednesday, March 15, Mr. Norman St.John-Stevas, M.P. gae his support to the coming political initiative in northern Ireland. He Welcomed the continuance of the by-partisan policy on Northern Ireland, and called for the return of the Irish Ambassador to his post. The Goverment 
is absolutely right in planning its initiative in Northern Ireland 
with the greatest care. The issues there are those of life and death, of civil war or peace. It is right, therefore, to guard as far as possible against any risk and to discuss in depth every aspect of this complex problem. No one should be surprised if there are differences of approach to the issue within the Cabinet, since the problems are so intractable. The important thing to note is that Cabinet, Government and Party are united on the two essential bases of policy. First, that the Protestant majority should not be separated from the United Kingdom against their will. Second, that the Catholic minority should be given full economic, civil and effective political rights within the Northern Ireland community. I do not know what is the package. This information is available only to members of the Cabinet, but I do know that any proposals put forward will be based on these two objectives. Some within the Tory Party fear that an initiative will play into the hands of the I.R.A. Quite the opposite is true. The I.R.A. have indulged in violence in recent weeks with the express purpose of sabotaging the Government initiative. If we can reconcile the Catholic minority to a reformed Stormont, the days of the I.R.A. are numbered.

Northern Ireland The opposition to a political initiative is based 
amongst other things on two falacies. The first (which I mentioned to you on Sunday) is that any concession to the Catholic minority would be a victory for the IRA. I spoke to AlAstair Hetherington and Norman St. John Stevas on this point yesterday. The latter spoke well in Panorama last night in a discussion with Angus Maude. Today’s Guardian leader is also helpful. The second fallacy is that the IRA’s violence can 
be suppressed by force of arms. This was the basis of Angus Maude’s argument last night. You may well have considered inviting the CGS to explain the impossibility of this to your Cabinet colleagues. Could he not also be exposed to a group of backbenchers?

14 March, 1972 You will have seen Dublin telegram No. 164 (I enclose a copy for ease of reference) containing 
a notably unconvincing Irish reply to Sir John Peck’s representations about the "Irish Independent" Supplement. 
Although this might at first sight seem to 
call for some form of public rebuke, we think it would be wiser at this stage not to initiate any further action. 
Instead we suggest that we should 
prepare a statement to be used if the matter were to become public, and privately inform the Irish of our intention to speak to such a brief if need be. 
which seem to support this approach - first, that 
the distribution had been completed before Mr. Lynch or the Irish PUS heard of it; and, second, that when they did see the Supplement all Irish posts were told that the Government did not endorse any statements or opinions expressed therein. 
(In our guidance to 
FCO posts, we have advised them to ensure that anyone showing interest in the "Irish Independent" Supplement should be urged to ask the Irish Mission whether the Irish Government do endorse its facts or theories.) 
In short this exercise does not 
appear to represent a considered tactic in a developing Irish propaganda campaign, but is rather a gesture to prove to the Government s domestic critics that at a time of crisis they did do something. 
Moreover since the item has in fact been available 
for over a month, and the reprint for nearly two weeks, and since neither has attracted comment, recriminations in public would only serve to breathe life into what seems to be more or less a dead issue. 
In any case This might encourage them to play the matter 
quietly. Sir John Peck gives in his telegram two points

Northern Ireland Perhaps the simplest way of guiding tomorrow’s Cabinet to the 
necessary conclusion would be as follows:(1) Some form of political initiative is now inevitable. 
Public 
expectation has been too far aroused, and speculation has become too widespread, to enable the Government to remain inactive any further. Alternatively, if they do refrain from any action, the situation could very rapidly turn very sour indeed. (2) At the same time there is no point in launching an initiative unless:(a) (b) 
the scheme is workable in practice; 
it is worth it in terms of the probable result, South of the Border no less than North; 
(c) (3) 
it is politically sustainable in the sense that the Government can carry it through, if necessary, against determined opposition. The Home Secretary’s proposals (possibly amended as the Foreign 
and Commonwealth Secretary suggests in the minute which he has sent you today) broadly satisfy (a) and (b). 
It is at (c) that they are most vulnerable 
in terms both of criticism from the Government’s supporters at Westminster and of the risk of a Protestant backlash in Ulster. And I suspect that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary’s variant would not be much less exposed to hostility - if only because few people would believe that at the end of six months we should really be able to impose a solution in default of agreement. (4) 
If the Cabinet would prefer something less than the Home Secretary’s 
proposals, they must decide how much less. Should it be only a referendum on the Border, the appointment of a separate Secretary of State and the transfer of law and order to Westminster? Or even merely the transfer of responsibility for internment? On either hypothesis:(a) This limited initiative should be workable in practice 
- but at the cost 
of making an arbitrary division between law and order on the one hand and other functions of government on the other hand, with the implication that Westminster would carry the responsibility for the

I really dislike Direct Rule for Northern Ireland 
because I do not believe that they are like the Scots or the Welsh and doubt if they ever will be. The real British interest would I think be served best by pushing them towards a United Ireland rather than tying them closer to the United Kingdom. Our own parliamentary history is one long story of trouble 2. 
I am sure that the Home Secretary is right to say that 
we can not go on as we are and his plan is aimed to secure a new and reformed Stormont. I fear however that the timescale in which we have been thinking for political consultations will mean that once the pattern of a Secretary of State in command of security has lasted for two years or so we shall not get away from direct rule. Would it be possible if we have to agree to prorogation to give a time limit (say six months) for an agreed political solution with notice that if it is not agreed we would impose our own solution and require a general election for the Stormont Parliament to be held upon it? I think that the odds are that the Northern Irish would not boycott such an election and that a different political pattern in Northern Ireland would emerge. 3. 
I seems to me that it could give us a breather, that it might provide a solution short of direct rule and that if it

Northern Ireland The points for discussion this morning can, perhaps, be summarised 
as follows:(i) 
Are the Cabinet sufficiently in agreement to enable us to start moving? In particular,do they endorse the policy which seems to offer the least scope for objection 
- namely, 
that we should ask Mr. Faulkner to agree to the transfer of law and order to Westminster, holding ourselves free, if he refuses, to say that we then have no option but to move straight to direct rule? 
(ii) 
What timetable should-we adopt for planning purposes, particularly as regards the choice between enacting the necessary legislation before or after Easter. The relevant considerations are:- 
(a) 
The time needed to confront Mr. Faulkner with the basic decision. Does this require 2 visits by him to London; or can we push all the water over the dam at a single meeting? 
(b) 
The need to secure (? simultaneously) a hard and firm agreement with Mr. Lynch about the action which he will take in the South to match our action in the North. This, too, will take a little time; and it pre-supposes that we know how much action on his part we would regard as adequate. 
(c) (d) (e) (f) 
The need to carry the Opposition at Westminster with us as far as possible. 
President Pompidou’s visit on the weekend of 18th/19th March. (We must try to avoid a second cancellation!) 
The Budget, which will monopolise most of the Parliamentary time in the week beginning 20th March. 
Easter on 2nd April (when the marching season will begin in Ulster). 
I think that the Lord President feels that, in the light of the above factors, it is unrealistic to suppose that we can complete the enactment of the necessary legislation before Easter - unless we now move very

10 March, 1972. I am to visit Washington and Ottawa over the next 
ten days and shall not be in the Office at all next week end the beginning of the following week.

9th March 1972 We know a good deal about him. 
You telephoned earlier this afternoon about Dr. John O’Connell. He approached the Dublin Embassy 
some time ago asking to see the Home Secretary and implying that he was in a position to speak for the I.R.A. 
After a good deal of 
thought the Home Secretary decided that, while it would be quite wrong for a Minister to receive an emissary from the I.R.A., I should see Dr. O’Connell. 
telephoned me several times afterwards. I did of the interviews: 
I had two long interviews with him and he I enclose a copy of the notes 
the second interview was just before "bloody 
Sunday" in Londonderry, which seemed to kill the idea dealt with in my note of 28th January. 
be confidential, Dr. O’Connell subsequently gave a suitably slanted version to the Irish newspapers. 
The Home Secretary remains of the opinion that it would be quite wrong for a Minister to receive an emissary of the I.R.A. 
The terms 
set out in the peace plan which Dr. O’Connell has brought with him this time confirmed him in this view. 
He tried to telephone Mr. Wilson 
before 4 o’clock to say that he had his reasons - which he would be happy to explain to Mr. Wilson, though not over the telephone - for not 
seeing Dr. O’Connell, but that if Dr. O’Connell said anything to Mr. Wilson which he thought it appropriate to pass on he would be happy to see Mr. Wilson about it. 
Although he promised that all discussions would G. L. ANGEL Robert Armstrong, Esq.

9th March, 1972. Madam, Your Majesty may have heard or seen recent reports 
about the possibility that your Government may be contemplating a new political initiative in Northern Ireland. I now write, with my humble duty to Your Majesty to indicate to you some of the background to these reports and to let you know the present position, as your Ministers now see it. 
As you will remember, Your Majesty’s ministers in 
Northern Ireland have made a number of proposals for constitutional reform in the Province, within the framework of the existing system. Though these proposals have offered to the Opposition Parties at Stormont who represent the Catholic minority a considerably greater degree of participation in the affairs of the Province, they have stopped short of participation in Government itself. The representatives of the Opposition Parties, for their part, have declared that the Stormont Government’s proposals do not go far enough for them.. The proposals which the Home Secretary has made for talks with all the parties concerr on the future of Northern Ireland have made no headway, because of the refusal of the Opposition Parties at Sto

Cabinet: Northern Ireland The Cabinet will wish to hear from Mr. Whitelaw a report on his 
visit to Northern Ireland over the weekend. Perhaps the main points to be dealt with can be grouped under the following headings A. 
The Security Situation (1) What were the reactions of the minority (and the IRA); the 
majority (according to whether they are followers of Mr. Faulkner, Mr. Paisley or Mr. Craig); the RUC; and the public service? In particular, how far can we continue to rely on the loyalty of the last two groups? (2) What are the risks of renewed violence and/or civil disobedience 
and industrial action? Are the security forces confident that they can deal with situations of this kind? (3) Are the preparations for the Easter marches adequate and complete? B. 
The Legal Basis of the New Regime 
(1) Are arrangements for the Commons debate agreed; and can we be reasonably sure that the Bill will receive Royal Assent before close of play on Thursday? In so far as certain Orders in Council may be needed immediately thereafter, are these ready? (2) How much Northern Ireland legislation which may be urgently 
needed will not reach the Statute Book before Stormont is prorogued? Is the Chief Whip satisfied that this potentially heavy item of additional Westminster business can be accommodated in the Government’s legislative programme without too much difficulty? (3) What are Mr. Whitelaw’s intentions about the establishment 
of his Advisory Commission in Northern Ireland? C. 
The Longer Term (1) How rapidly will Mr. Whitelaw be able to start releasing internees? 
Does he propose to deal with these cases entirely on his own responsibility? Or will he want to discuss at least the basic principles and criteria with his colleagues?

In sending you these transcripts, we want to make it clear that the 
programme was entirely impromptu and that this is not, therefore, a text; it is a transcription made from dictaphone recordings. There are often inaccuracies of detail due to the clash of voice or a not perfectly audible word. 
These transcripts, therefore, represent the general trend of the 
verbal discussion but should not be regarded as accurate in detail. Moreover, they do not indicate the changed flavour which expression and gesture in television can add to the spoken word.

DUBLIN TELEGRAM 222 OF 25 MARCH RFI UPREP BELFAST DIRECT RULE: IRISH REACTIONS. 
1. APART FROM THE SINN FEIN/IRA’S THE REACTION OF ALL POLITICAL 
GROUPS IN THE REPUBLIC HAS BEEN ONE OF RELIEF AND THEIR LEADERS, PARTICULARLY THE TAOISEACH ARE EVIDENTLY PRESSING HARD UPON THE NORTHERN MINORITY TO BE COOPERATIVE. THIS MORNINGS DECLARATION BY THE SDLP IS THE FIRST VISIBLE RESULT, AND SUCH PRESSURE IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE. 
2. I MUST HOWEVER UTTER A NOTE OF CAUTION AMIDST AND ABOUT THE 
PRESENT GENERAL EUPHORIA IN THE REPUBLIC. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT COULD GO SERIOUSLY WRONG IN AREAS OF POLITICS IN WHICH DUBLIN HAS CONSIDERABLE AND NOW INCREASED INFLUENCE AMONG THE MINORITIES. WE NEED TO APPRECIATE JUST HOW THIS INFLUENCE WILL BE EXERTED DURING THE NEXT FEW CRUCIAL WEEKS, ON THE SUBJECTS OF (1) SECURITY AND THE ENDING OF VIOLENCE (2) INTERNMENT (3) REUNIFICATION (4) TIMING. 
3. OF THESE, (1) AND (2) ARE CLOSELY INTERCONNECTED. THE BASIC 
ISSUE IS THE EXACT WAY IN WHICH THE IRISH SEE THE IRA BEING DEFEATED THROUGH THEIR LOSS OF POPULAR CATHOLIC SUPPORT. ONLY TO A LIMITED DEGREE WOULD THEY VISUALIZE IT HAPPENING THROUGH AN INCREASED FLOW OF INTELLIGENCE TO THE ARMY AND TE RUC, DENIAL OF SAFE HOUSES AND ARMS CACHES ETC, THUS MAKING IT EASIER FOR OUR SECURITY FORCES TO SEARCH AND CAPTURE OR DESTROY. THEY FORSEE THE IRA IN THE NORTH EVAPORATING IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT ALWAYS HAS. PUBLIC SUPPORT WITHERS AWAY, THEY JUST BURY THEIR ARMS AND MERGE INTO ORDINARY NON-VIOLENT LIFE, AND THE STRUGGLE IS EITHER DORMANT OR NON-VIOLENT. IT FOLLOWS THAT THE IRISH ARE EXPECTING MODIFICATIONS IN CURRENT SECURITY PROCEDURES IN PURSUIT OF SUSPECTS, SEARCHES OF HOUSES ETC, AND ANY EVIDENCE THAT DIRECT RULE HAS PRODUCED NO CHANGE AFTER A FAIRLY SHORT PERIOD WILL LEAD TO WIDESPREAD DISILLUSIONMENT.

DUBLIN TELEGRAM 219 OF 25 MARCH IMMEDIATE TO FCO RFI SAVING TO UKREP BELFAST. 
DIRECT RULE: REACTIONS IN THE IRISH REPUBLIC 
1. ON 24 MARCH THE FINE GAEL PARTY, THE MAIN OPPOSITION GROUP, ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING THAT THE SUSPENSION OF STORMONT HAD BEEN NECESSARY, BUT ’ANY NECESSARY DIMINUTION OF SELF GOVERNMENT IN ANY PART OF IRELAND IS A STEP BACKWARDS AND IT MUST BE FOR THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME’. NOTHING WAS TO BE GAINED BY ANY GROUP ACTING PROVOCATIVELY TOWARDS OTHER SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY AT THIS TIME. VIOLENCE MUST STOP TO ALLOW THE BREATHING-SPACE TO BEUSED. THE ADVISORY COMMISSION MUST BE SEEN TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE ROLE IN DECISION MAKING. ’IN THE PRESENT GRAVE SITUATION THE UTMOST VIGILANCE IS REQUIRED TO DEFEND, PROTECT AND STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS’ OF THE REPUBLIC. ’ON INTERNMENT, THE STATEMENT SAID, ’IN VIEW OF THE GUARDED AND IMPRECISE REFERENCES TO INTERNMENT IN MR HEATH’S SPEECH, IT WOULD BEPREMATURE FOR US TO COMMENT ON THIS ASPECT, BEYOND SAYING THAT THIS MATTER MUST BE SETTLED VERY RAPIDLY IN ORDER TO PERMIT DISCUSSIONS ON A PERMANENT AGREED SOLUTION TO GET UNDER WAY’. 
2. IN AN INTERVIEW, THE LABOURPARTY LEADER, MR CORISH, CALLED FOR 
A TRUCE IN THE NORTH AND URGED THE IRISH GOVERNMENT TO PRESS AHEAD WITH A NEW CONSTITUTION WHICH WOULD NOT OFFEND NORTHERN PROTESTANTS. RECONCILIATION IN THE NORTH WAS IMPORTANT: FEARS OF BOTH COMMUNITIES SHOULD BE ALLAYED. HMG’S THINKING ON INTERNMENT SHOULD BE SPELT OUT IN GREATER DETAIL. 
3. KEVIN BOLAND (AONTACHT EIREANN) REJECTED ANY PLEBISCITE NOT HELD ON A EW-COUNTY BASIS.

TO IMMEDIATE FCO TELEGRAN NUMBER 218 OF 25 MARCH INFO PRIORITY UKREP BELFAST. 
TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS BLATHERWICK/BURNS AND/ RESIDENT CLERK: S D L P. 
1. HALLIGAN, OF THE IRISH LABOUR PARTY, TOLD A MEMBER 
OF MY STAFF EARLY THIS MORNING THAT THE SDLP STATEMENT IN LONDONDERRY THIS MORNING WOULD INCLUDE A WELCOME OF HMG S ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY AND A SHARP ATTACK ON THE PROVISIONALS. THE SDLP MEETING IN LIFFORD YESTERDAY AFTERNOON HAD GONE BADLY: A SECTION LED BY PADDY DEVLIN HAD BEEN UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THE PACKAGE, PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUATION OF INTERNMENT AND PARTLY BECAUSE OF FEAR OF BEING SHOT BY THE PROVISIONALS. LAST NIGHT IN DUBLIN SDLP REPRESENTATIVES HAD MET THE IRISH GOVERNMENT, FINE GAEL AND LABOUR, WHO HAD MANAGED TO SWING THEM ROUND. THE SDLP NOW BELIEVE THAT THE PROVISIONALS IN THE NORTH WILL BE SPLIT INTERNALLY AND FROM THEIR SOUTHERN HQ OVER THE QUESTION OF CONTINUED VIOLENCE. 
2. HALLIGAN URGED A PERSONAL SUGGESTION THAT AN 
INVITATION FROM MR WHITELAW TO THE SDLP TO MEET HIM IN BELFAST DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS WOULD HELP STIFFEN THEIR RESOLVE. THERE ARE OBVIOUS DIFFICULTIES OVER FLATTERING THE SDLP AT THIS TIME, BUT AS SEEN FROM HERE SUCH A GESTURE, AS SOON AS IT IS PRACTICAL POLITICS, WOULD BE USEFUL.

"TODAY PROGRAMME" Transmitted 24 March 1972 EDWARD HEATH: Memories of the past are 
long lived. In all conscience you have suffered enough. What....(PAUSE 
Memories of the past are long lived. In all conscience you have suffered enough. What the government has done today, it is intended to give us the opportunity to put the past behind us. And to concentrate on the future. Let us take that opportunity together. Goodnight. 
PAUSE.....MUSIC EAMONN ANDREWS: 
Hello there. Crisis in 
Ulster, the suspension of Stormont, the introduction of direct rule, and the gradual phase out of internment, the guts of the Prime Minister’s long awaited Ulster initiative. Well here in the studio we have all shades of political opinion. And in the next hour we’ll try to present a picture to you of just what the massive change over’s going to mean, whether it’ll lead to eventual peace, or bloody civil war. And we start with Irish reaction. And just at this stage of the programme we’re going to just have opinions that will take about a minute, and then we come back and discuss them in more detail, and we start with the man you’ve probably just seen a moment ago, on the news, the Reverend Ian Paisley. What is your reaction and your prediction for the future as a result of this? 
REV IAN PAISLEY: Well I think that the 
government ah, at Westminster ah, has launched itself on a voyage of catastrophe, as far as Northern Ireland is concerned, and ah, my reaction is great disappointment, that they should after taking soundings on Northern Ireland about this situation, ah, persisted in this particular policy. About the future we can only hope and pray, and wait, events and I do trust that this will not lead to more violence. God knows we’ve had enough violence in Northern Ireland. 
Q: A: When you say a voyage of 
catastrophe, do you in fact mean, or think, a voyage of violence? 
Ah, I certainly do, because of 
the situation is simply this: That ah, ah, Mr Heath tells us tonight we are part and parts of the United Kingdom, we’re equal with all the other citizens in the United Kingdom, and now he proposes to rule us by decree

In sending you these transcripts, we want to make it clear that the programme was entirely impromptu and that this is not, therefore, a text; 
it is a transcription made from dictaphone recordings. There are often inaccuracies of detail due to the clash of voice or a not perfectly audible word. 
These transcripts, therefore, represent the general trend of the 
verbal discussion but should not be regarded as accurate in detail. Moreover, they do not indicate the changed flavour which expression and gesture in television can add to the spoken word.

A MINISTERIAL BROADCAST by 
THE PRIME MINISTER 
Sund recorded from No. 10 Downing Street 1600 for transmission BBC-1 1800 
24th March 1972 I am speaking to you tonight as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom - England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - and in 
particular to the people of Northern Ireland, whatever your job, your politics, or your religion. 
Northern Ireland and by the suffering it has caused. 
All of us have been horrified by the violence in As a government 
we have been doing everything in our power to bring that violence and that suffering to an end, because the United Kingdom, Parliament and government have the same duty towards the people of Northern Ireland as to the rest of the country, to 
protect their lives and property and to give them 
-- all of them -- a fair say in the decisions that shape their future. No single measure can overcome the bitterness of the past few years the bitterness, indeed of far too much of Northern Ireland’s history. The government have concluded, after long and anxious thought, that we must make possible a completely fresh start; and so we have worked out a set of proposals to provide this fresh star, the fresh start which is needed if we are to break out of the vicious circle of violence and yet more violence. 
1: 2: 3: 
Last Wednesday I put these proposals to Mr. Faulkner: That the United Kingdom government should take over 
responsibility for law and order in Northern. Ireland That there should be a gradual reduction in 
internment, beginning with those internees who could be released without unacceptable risks. 
That the people of Northern Ireland should be 
given a chance as soon as it is practicable and again at intervals later, to decide for themselves in a plebiscite whether or not they want to remain in the United Kingdom.

MR. FAULKNER’S VIEW ON INTERNMENT 1. 
In the course of our discussions the Prime Minister of Northern 
Ireland explained that he also would be prepared to accept a start being made on the release of internees. There is no difference of principle between us on this point. A VICTORY FOR THE IRA 2. 
The IRA have demanded: the withdrawal of the Army from the streets; the abolition of Stormont; an amnesty; 
The army will not be withdrawan from the streets until their presence is no longer necessary; Stormont is not being abolished 
- the Parliament simply stands 
prorogued; We aim to reduce the level of internment but there is no question of an amnesty for those who have been convicted of offences of violence. 
WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT PREPARED TO INTRODUCE A PLEBISCITE ABOUT NORTHERN IRELAND BUT NOT ABOUT ENTRY INTO THE EEC? 3. 
In the United Kingdom we have a fully effective Parliamentary 
system for debating and deciding on issues such as entry into the EEC. One of the problems in Northern Ireland has been the organisation of political parties on a sectarian basis which has in turn meant a permanent one-party majority in the Northern Ireland Parliament. In Northern Ireland there has not been the same confidence in all sections of the community in the Parliamentary system as a means of reaching decisions on vital issues such as the Border. It seems right therefore that in these special circumstances, a plebiscite should be used to permit a direct expression of opinion of the people.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 105 24 MARCH 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours There was a fair amount of shooting 
- 16 instances in Londonderry. 
13 in Belfast and thre elsewhere. Those in which the security forces were involved proved decidedly one-sided, in the Army’s favour, in terms of casualties. 2. 
In Belfast, as several petrol bombs were being thrown at a patrol 
in the Falls Road area, the troops fired at the people who could be seen throwing the bombs, hittin one of them. This turned out to be 
a youth aged 14, who later died in hospital. In a separate incident one soldier received a minor gunshot wound in the leg. In Londonderry the Army returned fire on several occasions and believe that they hit four gunmen in separate incidents. Two women and a boy aged eleven were admitted to hospital with gunshot wounds apparently received in incidents in which the security forces were not involved. 3. 
There were two large explosions, both of them outside the cities. During the morning a bomb of 100 - 150 lbs which had been left in a 
parked car exploded in Carrickfergus. There had been a telehone call half an hour before to say that a bomb had been left in a green vehicle in West Street; but the explosion in fact occurred in a red car in North Street. Fortunately the police spotted the red car and were able to clear the area, but 18 people required hospital treatment 
- including four policemen - although none of the injuries were 
serious. The explosion severely damaged six shops and caused external damage to many more. Six local men have been arrested in connection with this incident. 
4. bomb had been placed in the main 
Shortly after midniht a warning was given to the Press that a street of Bangor, Co. Down. The 
area was cleared, but two suspect cars could not be moved from the

TEXT OF A MINISTERIAL BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RIGHT HON. EDWARD I am speaking to you tonight as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland: and in particular to the people of Northern Ireland, whatever your job, your politics, or your religion. All of us have been horrified by the violence in Northern Ireland and by

Because the United Kingdom Parliament and Government have the same duty towards the people of Northern Ireland as to the rest of the country property, and to give them -

had hoped that he and his colleagues might see their way to accepting them. I was very sorry when he told me that he and his colleagues could not continue as the Government of Northern Ireland if responsibility for law and order were transferred to Westminster. But we believe that nothing less than the proposals I have described would enable us to break out of the deadlock of the last few months. The Government here in London is therefore obliged to take over for the time being full responsibility for the conduct of affairs in Northern Ireland. The Army will stay in Northern Ireland as long as any faction seeks to terrorise or intimidate ordinary people. There will be no let-up in the fight against terrorism. All the security forces will continue to have our full backing and support. I want, before I end, to say a special word to those of you who are our fellow citizens living in Northern Ireland. You are the ones who have had to endure the years of violence and fear. We admire the steadiness and courage with which you have done this. Now only you can take the decision to live together peace.

GEN 79 Points for discussion this evening:(1) 
The Bill (deal with this first because of the printing timetable) Should it go to print as it is? Or should we add anything to 
validate action which the Governor may have to take during the interval until the Bill is law? The answer depends to some extent on:(a) Whether or not Mr. Faulkner remains in office on a "caretaker" basis. 
(b) Whether or not there is industrial unrest on a scale requiring the Proclamation of an Emergency in circumstances in which the Governor might have been compelled to prorogue the Parliament at Stormont. 
How realare these risks? (At some stage we must decide who is to be responsible for piloting 
the Bill through the House of Commons and, in particular, for moving its Second Reading). (2) 
The Military Position Are the military authorities satisfied that they have taken all the 
necessary action for the immediate despatch of reinforcements if this proved to be necessary in the next few days? Are arrangements complete in Northern Ireland to deal both with 
any disorder in the next few days and with the Easter marches? The ban on the latter will presumably remain. But if it is defied it is now Westminster, not Stormont, which will be being outfaced. Are we ready and able to enforce the ban strictly? (3) 
is most likely to take, at least initially. Both Sir Harold Black and Mr. Bloomfield spoke to me last night with some concern about the position of the power stations in particular. What contingency plans exist at Stormont? And how far do they depend on help from Great Britain if necessary? 
Industrial Unrest There are some indications that this is the form which opposition

The Clause does not, of course, abolish the existing constitution of Northern Ireland (as set out in the Government of Ireland Act 1920), but suspends temporarily (see Note on sub-section 5) the legislative and executive instruments of the constitution and makes temporary provision in their place. 2.

to Northern Ireland affairs shall act as the "chief executive officer as regards Irish services"

Under section 1(3) of the civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 (Special Powers Act) the Minister of Home Affairs it riven power to make regulations "for making further provision for the preservation of the peace and maintenance of order". For the most part the provisions of the Special Powers Act and the regulations made under it do not correspond with provisions of the English Law. 2. The following are the reglations which are currently in use in Northern Ireland or have been used in the last two years. Regulation 4 provides a wide right of entry to land, buildings and vehicles for the police and the army. Regulation 5 gives the police and army a wide right to stop, search and seize vehicles and their contents. Regulation 6 gives the police and army right to stop and search people on suspicion that they are carrying anything prejudicial to the preservation of the peace or maintenance of order. Regulation 7 makes it everyone’s duty on request to stop and aswer any reasonable question from a policeman or soldier. Regulation 8 prohibits the existence of documents advocating a change in the constitution of Northern Ireland by violent methods; the unlawful raising or maintaining of a military and armed force; obstruction of the administration of justice or the enforcement of the law; and support for any organisation engaged in these activities Regulation 9 allows the erection of barriers, road blocks and the regulation of the use of vehicles. This reulation is the authority for the maintenance of a peace-line by the army.

NORTHERN IRELAND (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) SILL HOUSE OF COMMONS NOTES ON CLAUSES 
THE FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WESTMINSTER AND STORMONT 
1. Under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 orthern Ireland has its own Exchequer and budget. There are various taxes under the direct control of the Northern Ireland Parliament 
- eg vehicle licences, and estate duty, - while 
the remaining taxes (in fact almost all the major ones) are "reserved taxes" that is are levied directly by Westminster Departments at rates determined by the Westminister Parliament. Northern Ireland’s share of these reserved taxes is paid over to them, subject to the deduction of the cost of the reserved services performed by the United Kingdom Government in Northern Ireland, and of the Imperial Contribution. Under the Government of Ireland Act the share of taxes and the Imperial Contribution are determined by the Joint Exchequer Board, upon which there are representatives of the Treasury and of the Northern Ireland Ministry of finance. The Imperial Contribution was intended to be the just proportion of the cost of national debt charges, defence and overseas services, etc which should fall to Northern Ireland; in determining this the Joint Exchequer board was to "have regard to the relative taxable capacities of Ireland and the United Kingdom". 2. The revenues available to the Government of northern Ireland as set out above would not suffice to enable it to maintain a standard of services anything like that ruling in the rest of the United Kingdom, particularly if the Imperial Contribution were at more than a nominal level. It has however been policy since the 1930’s that so long as the inhabitants of Northern Ireland had parity in taxation with the rest of the United Kingdom they should enjoy parity of services. Parity of taxation means that the transferred taxes are not to be significantly lower than the corresponding taxes in Great Britain, and that the inhabitants of Northern Ireland should bear a rate burden comparable with that of the inhabitants of Great Britain. Provided that these conditions are fulfilled (as in general they are) the mechanics of the Government of Ireland Act are so worked, and are supplemented as described

MR FAULKNER AND HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMNT 
ALTHOUGH AGREEING WITH CERTAIN OF THE MEASURES PROPOSED, HAVE DEC. THAT ATHER THAN ACCEPT THE TRANSFER OF RESPONIBILITY OF LAW AND ORDR ONLY TO WESTMINISTER, THEY WOULD PREFER ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GO ERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND TO BE TRANSFERED TO H.M.G. THIS IS NOW BEING PUT IN HAND, AND A COMMISSION OF PERSONS RESIDENT IN, AND FULLY REPRESETATIVE OF, NORTHERN IRELAND WILL BE APPOINTED TO ADVISE AND ASSIST THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE. 
I DO NOT PRETEND THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING CONSTITUTES THE COMPLETE 
SOLUTION. OUR AIM, IS TO SING ABOUT A SITUATION IN WHICH A POLITICAL SOLUTION CAN BE FREELY DISCUSSED BY ALL CONCERNED FREE FROM THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE. THE MEASURES WE ARE NOW ADOPTING NECESSARILY DERIVE FROM THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE SITUATION AS IT IS NOW, AND THE NEED TO BRING THE MINORITY BACK TO POLITICAL PATHS WITHOUT CAUSING THE MAJORITY TO REACT DANGEROUSLY. 
THIS IS A DIFFICULT PERIOD - FOR US, FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
INDEED FOR THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. BUT THE SUCCESS OF THIS INITIATIVE WILL ALSO, IN SOME PART, DEPEND UPON THE SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR AIMS BY OUR FRIENDS OVERSEAS. AT THIS PARTICULARLY CRUCIAL TIME. IT IS IN MY VIEW ESSENTIAL FOR EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO BE DONE TO URGE MODERATION, RESTRAINT AND FLEXIBILITY ON ALL THE PARTIES CONCERNED. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE THOUGHT WHICH I KNOW YOU HAVE GIVEN TO THIS PROBLEM AND FOR THE UNDERSTANDING ATTITUDE WHICH YOU HAVE SHOWN. 
I AM 
CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL BE MAINTAINED DURING THE CORING WEEKS. ENDS. 3. YOU MAY ALSO

STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER - INTRODUCTION OF UNITED KINGDOM RULE 
1. With permission, Mr. Speaker, I will now make a statement about 
Northern Ireland. 2. 
This House has debated the affairs of Northern Ireland on many 
occasions in recent months. Throughout this period Her Majesty’s Government have been in close consultation with the Northern Ireland Government. At a meeting which my right honourable Friends, the Home Secretary, the Lord President of the Council, the Defence Secretary and I had with the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister of Northern Ireland on 22 March we made it plain 
- as indeed we had done on 
previous occasions - that new and more radical measures were necessary if the security and political situation in Northern Ireland were to be prevented from deteriorating even further. One specific problem has given Her Majesty’s Government increasing concern. The division of responsibility for law and order between Belfast and London is unsatisfactory in the present critical situation, since control remains largely with the Northern Ireland Government while responsibility rests mainly with the United Kingdom Government. And this responsibility is not merely domestic: it is international as well. We therefore told the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland that we had reluctantly, but firmly, reached the conclusion that responsibility for law and order in Northern Ireland should be transferred to Westminster. The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland /while willing to offer a measure of sharing between the two Governments in responsibility/made it plain that the /complete/ surrender of responsibility for law and order would be even less acceptable to his Government than the transfer to the United Kingdom Government of all responsibility for the government of the Province. /Reference to this evening’s meeting/ After the most careful and anxious consideration the United Kingdom 
Government have decided that they, for their part, cannot acquiesce in the continuation of the present arrangements. The House will, therefore, be invited on ............... 
to consider a short Bill transferring all 
legislative and executive powers now vested in the Northern Ireland Parliament and Government to the United Kingdom Parliament and a United Kingdom Minister. 
This will be a temporary measure, expiring 
after one year unless this Parliament resolves otherwise. The Parliament of Northern Ireland would stand prorogued but would not be dissolved.

SECRETARY CF STATE FOR FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRS 
My personal assessment of the Irish Government 
reaction to the three possibilities in telegram No. 98 is as follows:(1) unacceptble for the same reason - too late; 
too little and 
(2) acceptable, because they believe that in practice it would prove not very different from (3); 
(3) would be acceptable. I believe that if the Irish liked the rest of our 
proposals Mr. Lynch would regard periodical referenda as taking care of the reunification question if, without changing the substance of our attitude we were able to phrase it in a slightly more forthcomin manner. However, I must stress that the Irish Government and 
public opinion would regard both (2) and (3) as the necessary preliminary to our tackling the real issue, which in their view is how to obtain a political settlement in which the Catholics need no longer feel they are second class citizens. 
It is this issue which in their 
view will determine whether the bombing and violence cease. There are some indications that the Provisional IRA 
leadership might be prepared to call off the campaign of violence even though their extreme demands 
- the abolition 
of Stormont, the release of all internees and "political prisoners" and the withdraal of the British Army from Northern Ireland 
- were not met.

PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland I suggest that when you see the Lobby at noon 
tomorrow you take the opportunity to chart the course of the Government’s thinking in recent months. 2. 
You might speak on the following lines:In the first few months following the 
introduction of internment on 9 August the IRA terrorism was fairly effective. 
By November 
however the Army’s tactics began to have an impact. In January the Government were able to contemplate a situation arising in the spring or early summer when the IRA’s hold over the Catholic minority (except in London-derry) would have been loosened to the point where it might have become possible to hold talks of the kind envisaged by the Home Secretary in his statement of 7 September. Londonderry administered a shock to opinion 
throughout Ireland. This, and the sequel at Newry, created a new situation in which direct intervention by H.M. Government became a possibility. Ministers therefore set to work urgently to 
consider whether this possibility was real and if so how it could best be exploited. 
Early in the 
process which then ensued Ministers came to the conclusion that the effect of Londonderry on public opinin made it not only possible but in fact desirable for the Government to intervene. 
The 
post-Londonderry situation provided an opportunity by direct intervention to break the circle of violence and make a new start.

You have just conveyed to us by telephone the decision of the United Kingdom Cabinet that all responsibilities of the Northern Ireland Government and Parliament in relation to law and order should be transferred to Westminster. You have also made it clear that even this change is intended only to create a situation in which further radical changes, of a nature we believe to be unrealistic and unacceptable, will be discussed. 
We now convey to you formally the unanimous view of the Cabinet of Northern Ireland that such a transfer is not justifiable and cannot be supported or accented by us. It would wholly undermine the powers, authority and standing of this Government without justification and for no clear advantage to those who are suffering in Northern Ireland today. 
We wish to point out with a sense of the heavy responsibility involved that the imposition of this proposal, involving as it will the resignation of the Government of Northern Ireland as a whole, may have the gravest consequences, the full extent of which cannot now be foreseen.

Northern Ireland Counter Proposals The Stormont system would remain, subject to the 
following adjustments:(i) Internment. 
It is agreed that a beginning 
should be made with a phasing out of internment, which would continue subject to a satisfactory diminution of violence. The categories for this phasing out will be agreed by the Joint Security Committee, which will be augmented by a United Kingdom Minister, who will be joint chairman of the Committee with the Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs; each of these joint chairmen will have a right of veto; 
The formal authority 
in connection with internment, whether for purposes of release or future internment, will continue to rest with the Northern Ireland Minister for Home Affairs; and the representative of the United Kingdom Government will be associated with him in the decisions on individual cases. 
(ii) The Special Powers Act will be replaced by fresh legislation enacted at Stormont providing that in future emergency measures, including internment, may not be instituted except after the proclamation of an Emergency which will require the approval of the United Kingdom Secretary of State. This legislation could be introduced now; but it would not take effect until the current emergency is over.

disposition to suggest alterations, you should say that this whole exercise has been most finely balanced, and nothing further can be done at this stage. 
But, 
as Mr. Lynch will see, our purpose is to bring about conditions in which political advance can take place, and this gives an opportunity for further ideas to be developed.

STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER - MR FAULKNER HAVING With permission, Mr Speaker, I will now make a statement about 
Northern Ireland. [ 
Yesterday] my right honourable Friends, the Home Secretary, the 
Defence Secretary and the Lord President of the Council had further discussions with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who was accompanied by the Deputy Prime Minister. These talks were a continuation of earlier ones and of the continuous contact which there has been between the two Governments. I am glad to be able to tell the House that we have reached agreement on the measures which are now urgently necessary. Her Majesty’s Government have repeatedly made it clear that they 
have never believed that the problem in Northern Ireland can be resolved by purely military means. My right honourable Friend, the Home Secretary, has made constant efforts to get inter-communal discussions going and much of what he has been doing has had to remain confidential. These efforts have not been successful so far; there has been no move towards reconciliation and opposition between the communities shows signs of getting worse. A new and more radical effort must now be made before the situation deteriorates even further. This Government has always found the division of responsibility 
for law and order between Belfast and London to be unsatisfactory despite basic agreement between the two Governments on policy and goodwill in resolving any particular points of difference. But in both the political and the security contexts control remains largely

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 103 22 MARCH 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours It was Londonderry’s turn to be the focal point of IRA activity 
which included nine shooting incidents and four explosions there. 2. 
The shooting included a gun battle between troops and gunmen on 
the edge of the Creggan estate, which lasted through most of the afternoon. Shortly after 2 p.m. a helicopter flying over the area had spotted a gunman on the south-west of the estate and two sections of troops were landed nearby. As they moved towards the spot where 
the an had been seen they came under fire from at least three around 
positions / the estate. During the next two hours the troops endeavoured to manoeuvre into positions from which they could return the fire effectively. It was estimated that about 20 gunmen were involved during this period and that some 400-500 rounds were fired at the troops. 3. 
Later in the afternoon another section approaching from the 
south-east was also fired upon; and on two occasions further gunmen were seen arriving by car, bringing the total to about 40. sniping continued during the early evening while a further 200-300 rounds were fired at the troops. The troops continued to return the fire, and attempted to draw the gunmen out from their positions 
- but 
without success. As darkness fell the troops withdrew, still under fire. Throughout the engagement the Army had fired a total of 153 rounds, all 7.62. No casualties wore identified. 4.

During this engagement it was noticed that the gunmen were able

The main points which you may wish to put to the Cabinet tomorrow 
are, I think, as follows:(i) 
The decision which the Cabinet took at their last meeting i. e. the transfer of law and order from Stormont to Westminster 
(ii) - has been communicated to Mr. Faulkner. 
Mr. Faulkner has rejected it on the grounds that it would imply a fundamental lack of confidence in his Administration; that the Government of Northern Ireland would cease to be a Government in any real sense; and that the change would be universally seen as a victory by the IRA. He has said thateven though he would intensely dislike direct rule and could not guarantee how he would react to it, he would regard it as less unacceptable than the transfer of law and order. At the same time he has made counter proposals as in the annexed document. 
(Copies are available to be handed round during the Cabinet.) (iii) 
The Cabinet must now decide whether they regard these counter proposals as:- 
(a) 
adequate in substancebearing in mind that internment and security would be only joint functions, with no certainty that the will of the United Kingdom Government would prevail; and that the "further constitutional changes" which the Northern Ireland Government envisage would not in fact guarantee the minority an effective share in the government and administration of the Province as of right; 
(b) 
convincing in presentation, bearing in mind that the whole purpose of HMG’s policy at this moment is to win back the minority to active participation in the discussion of Northern Ireland’s future, and to induce Mr. Lynch to take more effective action against the IRA in the South.

Northern Ireland Counter Proposals 
Internment The Northern Ireland Government have proposed the following 
statement:"The Governments of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland have decided to make an immediate gesture in the interests of an early end to violence and a resumption of normal, constructive political activity in Northern Ireland. 
The Advisory Committee on Internment have been reviewing internment cases and recommending release where, because of a change in attitude, there is considered to be no appreciable degree of risk. 
The two Governments have now agreed that, from amongst those of the internees whose release has not been recommended, but who are recognised by the security forces as constituting a lesser degree of risk [x] should forthwith be released as an earnest of the desire to reverse the entire cycle of violence and the counter-measures taken to deal with it. 
The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and the Home Secretary will from now on meet at regular intervals to assess the situation, and - taking into account in particular any appreciable de-escalation of violence, but also any moves by other sections and groups to normalise public life - will consider together when and in what numbers further internees of lower risk rating may be released. 
It will of course be the intention when violence 
has clearly come to an end to wind down any remaining internment as rapidly as this can safely be done.

22 March 1972 We spoke this morning on the telephone about the proposed 
submission and statement annexed to your letter of 21 March; and just before the meeting with Mr Faulkner started, I was able to hand Peter Gregson the suggested revision of the draft statement which has been approved by the Secretary of State for Defence. 
I enclose, for the record, a copy of this suggested 
revision; and I also enclose a redraft of the covering submission in which the amendments that we would like to see made are sidelined. 
May I take the opportunity to emphasise the following 
points:a. 
In the view of the Secretary of State and CGS, it is essential that a statement about the rundown of internment should be made as part of the "package" and that it should be a statement which will make a convincing impact: this involves a risk which has to be accepted: anything which does not go as far as the revised statement which we now suggest is unlikely to have an adequate impact on the situation. 
b. Gregson. 
It is important to retain an oath or declaration as a condition of release,for the reasons setout in the revised draft submission.

RUNDOWN OF INTERMENT A possible statement by the Secretary of State for 
Northern Ireland on the rundown of internment is attached at the annex. 
It is proposed that this statement should 
form part of the main statement of HMG’s political initiative.. As to the machinery of review, it seems desirable that it should be administrative rather than judicial. 
The 
latter would not be sufficiently responsive to a fast moving situation. 
If that is agreed, it is important 
not to lose sight of the fact that neither releases from internment nor internment orders themselves are pure acts of policy. 
If an internment order depends on the 
individual concerned being a danger to public security, then his release must imply that that danger is no longer present. 
some new situation arises, ie that he himself re-engages in illegal activity or that the general situation has deteriorated. 
public statements made about the review. This means that he cannot be reinterned unless 
But it also implies a need for care in any If in fact the 
category C. internees are all about equal from the point of view of danger to the public safety, then the moment some of them are released the continued detention of the others in category C. is called into question. 
This 
seems to mean that the matter will have to be dealt with on a strictly individual basis, and it also means that only general conditions can be applied to the continued rundown of internment. 
These dangers are somewhat mitigated

Reference 2 - 50.00% Coverage
It is HMG’s intention to release as soon as possible 
those internees about whom there is a reasonable degree of doubt as to the danger to security that their release would pose. 
Their release will be conditional on an undertaking 
not to take part in or encourage violence or illegal action. It is hoped that upwards of [about] 100 internees can 
be said to be in this category, and it is hoped to release them during the next few weeks. 
The S of S for Northern 
Ireland is establishing immediately a procedure to review each case personally. If the measures which HMG have taken lead, as is hoped 
they will, to a reduction in terrorist activity, it will be possible to consider further releases; but this must of course depend on a clearly established improvement in the security situation. It is HMG’s clear intention to bring internment to an 
end, when respect for the law and a normal situation of order have been restored throughout the Province. However, as long as active terrorism persists and 
bombing and shooting continues, HMG must retain the power to arrest and intern those whom there is good reason to believe are actively involved.

TO ROUTINE FCO TELEGRAM U/N OF 31 MARCH 1972. FROM CLIFF HILL STORMONT CASTLE 
HERE FOLLOWS STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND ON 31 MARCH 
I KNOW THAT WITH THE APPROACH OF EASTER AND WITH THE SUMMER MONTHS AHEAD OF US PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHAT WOULD BE MY POLICY ON A SUBJECT WHICH I APPRECIATE IS OF SIGNIFICANCE TO YOU MARCHES. IN THE LAST FEW DAYS I HAVE RECEIVED REPRESENTATIONS FROM MANY QUARTERS THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME RELAXATION OF THE PRESENT RULES. 
LET ME GIVE THIS ASSURANCEI DO NOT WISH TO CONTINUE ANY RESTRICTIONS ON ANY FORM OF NORMAL PEACEFUL ACTIVITY FOR ONE MOMENT LONGER THAN IS NECESSARY. BUT LET ME ALSO SAY THIS: DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PAST BY MEN OF GREAT EXPERIENCE WHICH I MUST NATURALLY TAKE SERIOUSLY INTO ACCOUNT. MY RESPONSIBILITY TO THIS COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE AND TO THE SECURITY FORCES MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE I CHANGE THOSE DECISIONS. I MUST LOOK AT ANY PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE IN THE LIGHT OF THE GENERAL SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY. I HAVE BEEN SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND FOR ONLY ONE DAY. THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO FEEL THAT I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION. IF I WERE TO TAKE A DECISION NOW TO CHANGE THE EXISTING LAW I SHOULD BE RIGHTLY CRITICISED FOR OVER HASTY ACTION. SO FOR THE PRESENT THE LAW MUST STAND BUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL HELP ME IN MY THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE.

NORTHERN IRELAND: CURRENT SITUATION REPORT NO 10930 MARCH 1972 
Incidents in the last 24 hours In general it was a much quieter day and the number of incidents of security significance showed a marked reduction - though those 
that did occur included three unpleasant explosions. 2. 
A senior Armaments Technical. Officer, Major Bernard Calladene, 
was fatally injured by an explosion in Wellington treet in the centre of Belfast. 
A bomb had been left in a stolen car and the bomb 
disposal team had started to carry out a preliminry inspection when the explosion occurred shortly before midnight. 3. 
A bomb disposal team was also present, and was tryin to take 
preventive action, when a large explosion took place earlier in the evening in Chichster Street, also in the city centre. A bomb of 100 to 150 lbs had been placed on a stolen lorry which was parked in the road at a point surrounded by Court buildings. The explosion caused a fair amount of external damage to the buildin s but there were no casualties. There were two smaller explosions in Belfast, in the areas of Springfield Road .(close 
to the interface with 
the Shankill area) and Old Park. 4. 
Early this morning a bomb estimated at 10 to 20 lbs exploded in 
the boot of a car belonging to Mr. Ivor Cooper, the SDLP Stormont MP, outside his home in Londonderry. Shortly before, Mr. Cooper had received a telphone cal1 asking him to go to Altnagelvin Hospital to identify a friend who had been involved in a traffic accident; he was suspicious and telephoned the RUC who confirmed that the call was a hoax. But for this precaution, he might well have been in the car when the bomb went off. 
5. 
Elsewhere in Londonderry a 15 lb bomb was fond in William Street and successfully defused. There were three explosions in the rural

TODAY’S NEW YORK TIMES LEADER SPEAKS OF ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENTS FOLLOWING THE SUSPENSION OF STORMONT. EVEN MR CRAIG HAS IMPLORED THE PROTESTANT MAJORITY TO CONFINE ITS REACTION TO BOYCOTTS ETC AND NOT ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE. THE GREATEST LET-DOWN IS MR FAULKNER’S DECISION TO FOLLOW CRAIG IN URGING NON-COOPERATION. ON THE CATHOLIC SIDE THE BIGGEST LET-DOWN WAS THE OPPOSITION FROM THE CIVIL RIGHTS ASSOCIATION. IF ITS LEADERS HAD JOINED THE SDLP IN COOPERATING WITH MR WHITELAW THEY COULD HAVE ISOLATED ANY IRA FACTIONS WISHING TO CONTINUE TERRORISM. NEVERTHELESS, MR HEATH’S BOLD IF BELATED DECISION HAD CLEARLY MADE A STRONG APPEAL TO CATHOLICS AND IF THE IRA CONTINUES ITS TERRORIST TACTICS IT MIGHT LOSE CATHOLIC SUPPORT. 2. NEW YORK TIMES ALSO, HOWEVER, PRINTED AN ARTICLE BY ROY HATTERSLEY DESCRIBED AS OPPOSITION SPOKESMAN FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DATELINED LONDON, WHICH, WHILE AGREEING THAT THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY OF MR HEATH’S INITIATIVE BEING SUCCESSFUL, CONTAINED A VIOLENT ATTACK ON PAST BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND STORMONT POLICIES WHICH WILL PROVIDE EXCELLENT AMMUNITION FOR OUR ENEMIES HERE. THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE GIVES ITS FLAVOUR. BEGINS: STORMONT’S PURPOSE WAS THE PRESERVATION OF A PERMANENT UNIONIST HEGEMONY IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
..... ITS WEAPON WAS FEAR. 
ITS RECORD WAS DISGRACEFUL. THE POLICE WERE AN INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. HOUSES AND JOBS WERE ALLOCATED NOT ACCORDING TO NEED OR ABILITY BUT ACCORDING TO THE APPLICANT’S RELIGION. 
..... AND 
ALL THAT WAS ALLOWED TO GO ON FOR FIFTY YEARS. FOR THROUGHOUT MODERN HISTORY, BRITAIN’S RELATIONS WITH IRELAND HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED 
BY TWO FATAL ATTITUDES. THE FIRST IS THE CONTEMPT IN WHICH WESTMINSTER HAD HELD THE PROMISE INHERENT IN THE ACT OF UNION OF EQUAL LAWS, EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND EQUAL PROSPECT OF PROSPERITY. THE SECOND IS THE WILLINGNESS OF BRITAIN TO ALLOW IRELAND TO SUFFER AS LONG AS THE SUFFERING IS SILENT. ENDS.

MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM AN TAOISEACH, MR. JOHN LYNCH. T.D., FOR THE RT. HON. EDWARD HEATH. M.P., PRIME MINISTER 
I thank you for your message of the 24th March advising me of what you intended to say in the House of Commons later in the day. 
So far as public response to your statement in the House is concerned I issued a brief communique early on Friday afternoon last. 
Its contents, no doubt, were conveyed to you. 
Naturally we saw it as our primary duty to ensure, to the fullest extent our influence extended, that your proposals should bring an end to violence on the one side whilst also avoiding violence on the other. 
The Leaders of the 
Opposition Parties here, with whom I had private conversations, were equally concerned that their comments and those of their colleagues should be suitably helpful. 
The same was 
the view of the Leaderships of the Social Democratic and Labour Party and of the Nationalist Party with whom my colleagues and I had a meeting on Friday evening. 
So far events have been reasonably favourable. I am 
confident that the political leadership of the minority in the North now have the opportunity, allied to the skill and determination, to lead their community away from any condoning of the further use of violence. 
I am also more 
than a degree optimistic that the broad mass of the majority community prefer to live in peace and will not follow a violent crusade to restore a political leadership which had grievously failed them over a long period of time.

GEN 79 There are 2 questions on which early operational decisions are 
required. The first is the future of the ban on marches with which is linked the question of troop reinforcements. 2. 
Opinion within the Ministry of Defence seems to be rather 
divided about the ban; and this division may be reflected in any memorandum which the Department are able to circulate for tomorrow’s meeting. 
The purely military view,to which I believe that both the CGS 
and General Tuzo subscribe, appears to favour maintaining the ban completely. The alternative,more "political"view would concede that marches may take place in principle but only subject to appropriate safeguards, particularly as regards the routes to be followed. The choice between these 2 courses is not easy; but it may be assisted if we remember that:(a) Whatever treatment we accord to the Republican marches at Easter, we may well be expected to extend "in fairness" to the Orange marches in the summer. If we are not going to be able to enforce a complete ban on the latter it might be wiser to concede the point o principle in relation to the former. 
(b) The decision must have some effect on the question of reinforcements. 
These may be necessary in any eventif the 
latest military assessment of the Protestant reaction foreshadows trouble over the Easter weekend. They will presumably be even more necessary if we give the Protestants an additional cause of offence by permitting Republican marches, albeit subject to safeguards. 
3. I should not be surprised if Ministers decide tomorrow that the 
least disadvantageous course, with one eye on the Orange marches in the summer, would be to permit the Republican marches at Easter on a restricted scale, even at the cost of sending further troops to Northern Ireland. But the decision will not be easy; and a great deal will depend on Mr. Whitelaw’s own "feel" of the situation. 4. 
The second issue requiring early decision is the guidance to be 
given to the Army on their operational policy in predominantly Roman Catholic areas where they are at present maintaining a "low profile".

NORTHERN IRELAND (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) BILL HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Introduction all 
The Bill temporarily transfers/responsibility for the government of northern Ireland , both legislative and executive; to the United Kingdom Government. 2. The framework of the Northern Ireland Government is retained but all responsibility and power is placed in the hands of a Secretary of State who will be answerable to the Parliament at Westminster. There will be no Northern Ireland Minister ; the Governor will remain but with no functions; Stormont is prorogued and cannot be recalled until clause 1 of the Bill lapses or fresh legislation is introduced. The Secretary of State will administer the Province through the existing orthern Ireland Departments. Northern Ireland legislation will be incorporated in Orders in Council at Westminster; these will normally be subject to negative resolution procedure but affirmative resolution procedure is required if taxation is involved. Regulations under the Special Powers Act will be subject to negative procedure. The Attorney General for England and Wales becomes the Northern Ireland Attorney General in right of 
3. The Secretary of State is required to appoint a Northern Ireland Commission to advise him. 
The Comission must be consulted about Orders in Council 
replacing Northern Ireland legislation and new regulations under the Special Powers Act except when considerations or urgency preclude it. The Secretary of State will normally take the chair at meetings of the Commission.

CONTROLS OF MARCHES At Annex A is a signal from UK Rep advising on the line 
to be taken for the control of marches in Northern Ireland in the immediate future. At Annex B is a list of the marches which are expected to take place over Easter. 
2. 
There are essentially three options open: a. 
it effectively; b. 
to maintain the present ban on marches and to enforce to leave the ban nominally in force, but to limit 
control to token enforcement (and not even that in Londonderry) provided the marches avoid sectarian boundaries; c. 
to lift the ban while retaining control over the routes to be taken by marchers. 3. The course advised by the GOC and UK Rep is b., at least 
until after Easter - basically on the ground that this is not the time to antagonise the Protestants by making a gesture to republicanism. However, it is arguable that: i. 
retaining the ban while manifestly not enforcing it is just as likely to antagonise the Protestants as lifting the ban with proper safeguards; 
ii. if one does not intend to have a head-on confrontation with the Catholics by enforcing the ban, one might as well gain some political capital with them by lifting it. 
4. The signal points out, at paragraph 3, the large deployment 
of forces that would be necessary to enforce the ban if it is still in operation by 12 July. This may understate the difficulty which would then arise. (No previous ban has been in force on that date.) A decision to lift the ban before July must therefore be counted fairly likely. 
5. The signal proposes that the subject should be reconsidered 
in the second half of April. But a decision to lift the ban at that stage might coincide with the publication of Lord Widgery’s findings, and be seen as a consequence of them.

From: UK REP NORIRELAND To: 
DIG RTT MOD UK FOR CGS. 
MODUK HOME OFFICE LONDON 
HOME OFFICE LONDON. PLEASE PASS THE FOLLOWING 
AS A TELEGRAM TO THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL FROM UKREP. BAN ON MARCHES. ONE. 
THE UNANIMOUS ADVICE OF THE D OF OPS WEEKLY MEETING THIS 
MORNING WAS THAT THE BALANCE OF ADVANTAGE LAY IN CONTINUING THE BAN ON MARCHES AT LEAST UNTIL AFTER EASTER, BUT THAT THE EASTER MARCHES SHOULD BE HANDLED BY THE SECURITY FORCES IN SUCH A WAY AS TO REDUCE TO A MINIMUM THE RISKS OF ANY SERIOUS CONFRONTATION. TWO. 
BEFORE REACHING THIS CONCLUSION, ALTERNATIVE COURSES OF 
ACTION WERE CONSIDERED INCLUDING A. B. 
LIFTING THE BAN COMPLETELY. LIFTING THE BAN ONLY ON THE MAJOR TRADITIONAL MARCHES SUCH AS 
THE REPUBLICAN PARADES AT EASTER AND THE ORANGE PARADES ON 12 JULY. THREE. 
THE MERITS OF SOME RELAXATION NOW RATHER THAN LATER ARE 
FIRST THAT THE ENFORCEMENT OF A BAN ON THE MAIN ORANGE MARCHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE CLIMATE WHICH COULD REIGN AT THAT TIME, WOULD REQUIRE A BIG DEPLOYMENT OF FORCE, AND THAT IF THE JULY ORANGE MARCHES WERE TO BE ALLOWED, IT WAS ARGUABLE THAT THE REPUBLICAN MARCHES AT EASTER SHOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED. 
IN ADDITION IT MIGHT 
BE CONSIDERED DESIRABLE THAT WITH THE CHANGE TO TEMPORARY DIRECT. RULE THERE SHOULD BE SOME CHANGE OF STYLE AND THAT A RELAXATION OF THE BAN WOULD PROVIDE A SUITABLE STARTING POINT. FOUR. 
HOWEVER THE MEETING CONSIDERED THAT THE FOLLOWING COUNTER 
ARGUMENTS WERE OVERRIDING A. 
TO LIFT THE BAN BEFORE EASTER WOULD BE REGARDED BY PROTESTANTS 
AS A FURTHER AND UNWARRANTED CONCESSION TO REPUBLICANISM. B. 
IT WOULD ALSO BE LOOKED ON AS ANOTHER MOVE AGAINST FAULKNER WHO, 
AT SOME POLITICAL RISK TO HIMSELF, EXTENDED THE BAN IN JANUARY ON SECURITY FORCES ADVICE.

In a statement on 24 March Mr Faulkner said that his Government had been 
unable to accept the British Government’s original proposal for the transfer of responsibility for security to the United Kingdom Parliament because this was "a vital principle". 
On the British Government’s consequential proposals 
Mr Faulkner said that he opposed an advisory commission as "basically undemocratic", and many people, he said, would draw the message from these events that violence paid. 
He asked people to remain calm, and on no account to be led into 
confrontation with the security farces. 5.

Mr Faulkner is reported to have said that Unionists could no longer rely on the United Kingdom Government. Unionists’ strength lay in their power of veto. The parliamentary party and leadership would meet regularly to formulate detailed policies and report to the Unionist Council: no political solution would work without their co-operation. 
The proposed commission, he said, would have no 
credbility or standing. 6. 
At a large rally (reportedly 100,000 people) at Stormont on 29 March called by the Ulster Vanguard Mr Faulkner said that he shared peoplo’s resentment and

March, 1972 IRA TACTICS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
The IRA employs three main weapons in its campaign in Northern Ireland: the stationary bomb, the missile bomb and small arms. 
the target Whatever - and the IRA now tends to avoid well-defended military targets, 
seeking instead to cause destruction and casualties in civilian areas bombs are inevitably indiscriminate; and the organisation has shown scant regard for innocent parties when opening fire with small arms. 
uses a crowd as cover. All in all, its tactics are causing an increasing 
number of deaths among the civilian population. Most of the bombings and shootings in Northern Ireland are the work 
of the breakaway Provisional wing of the IRA whose declared aim is the disruption of life to such an extent that the province becomes ungovernable. It regards the deaths of women and children with equanimity. 
The death of 
18-month-old Angela Gallagher, killed by a terrorist’s bullet in the Falls Road area of Belfast on September 3, 1971, was described by Mr Rory Brady, Chief of Staff of the Provisional IRA, as "one of the hazards of urban guerrilla warfare". 
the IRA, which, despite its stated preference for political methods, does not eschew violence. 
of the 16th Parachute Brigade in Aldershot, England on February 22, 1972, caused the deaths of five women domestic workers, a civilian gardener and a Roman Catholic padre. 
Stationary bombs The use of gelignite bombs against public buildings is the main 
feature of the IRA’s current campaign. These are intended to achieve 
the propaganda effect of an explosion, the disruption of normal life, the destruction of strategic targets and the intimidation of the organisation’s opponents. A subsidiary purpose is to draw security forces into the open so that they become a target for snipers. 
suggests that their main use is as a terror weapon, or for propaganda purposes. 
The placing of bombs in public houses, hotels, shops and offices The improved security arrangements around strategic targets 
have to a large extent forced the IRA to seek other ways of trying to show that its capacity for destruction is unhampered, and the majority of deaths and injuries from bombings occur among the non-active population. 
Two 
of the more vicious attacks occurred on August 25, 1971, when a bomb placed in a locker room at the Belfast office of the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland killed one man and injured 30 office girls; and on January 26, 1972, when a 100 lb. bomb sent to the partly completed Belfast Telephone Exchange in Grosvenor Road was discovered only minutes before it exploded. 
The latter put at risk 30 or 40 of the 100 people 
working in the building. The use of gelignite and the lack of properly designed time fuses 
and safety devices make the bombs unpredictable. By giving warning 
that they have been placed, the IRA hopes to escape too much censure, but since they often explode prematurely such warnings tend to be useless. An instance of this occurred on December 4, 1971, when 15 people died in McGurk’s Bar in Belfast. 
The balance of incidents is supplied by the Official wing of The bombing by the Official IRA of the officers’ mess

TO PRIORITY CERTAIN MISSIONS TEL NO. GUIDANCE 59 OF 2 MARCH. NORTHERN IRELAND: BORDER INCIDENTS INVOLVING THE IRA. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
WE DO NOT SEEK TO INITIATE A GENERAL PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE IRISH REPUBLIC IN THIS MATTER. BUT EQUALLY WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO LEAVE UNANSWERED ACCUSATIONS THAT IRA ACTIVITIES ALL ORIGINATE IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND THAT INCIDENTS ON THE BORDER ARE DUE TO BRITISH POLICIES AND THE PROVOCATION OF ESSENTIALLY LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS OF THE IRISH REPUBLIC. THIS GUIDANCE MAY THEREFORE BE USED, AS APPROPRIATE, EITHER TO COUNTER IRISH PROPAGANDA, OR TO INSTRUCT THE ILL-INFORMED THAT IRA ACTIVITY IS NOT A SPONTANEOUS MOVEMENT OF ROMAN CATHOLICS SEEKING CIVIL RIGHTS. IT SHOULD ALSO BE USED TO PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE ANY IRISH CLAIM THAT THEY ARE DOING ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO CONTROL THE ACTIVITIES OF THE IRA IN THE REPUBLIC. 
INCIDENTS. 
2. THERE HAVE BEEN 157 BORDER INCIDENTS IN THE PERIOD 9 AUGUST 1971 (WHEN POWERS OF INTERNMENT WERE INTRODUCED AND MANY IRA MEN FOUND IT SENSIBLE TO LEAVE NORTHERN IRELAND AND OPERATE FROM THE SANCTUARY OF THE REPUBLIC) TO 6 FEBRUARY 1972. BY BROAD CATEGORIES THESE MAY BE SUMMARISED AS FOLLOWS: 
(A) FIRE HAS BEEN OPENED FROM THE REPUBLIC 85 TIMES: (B) CUSTOMS POSTS HAVE BEEN BLOW UP OR BURNT DOWN 39 TIMES: (C) OTHER PRIVATE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN ATTACKED 7 TIMES:

1st March, 1972 The Parker Report Many thanks for your letter of 24th February about the inconsistency 
between paragraph 14 c(ii) of the Gardiner Report and Dick White’s evidence to the Committee. I have managed to have a word with Dick about this on the telephone; and I hope that I may be able to pursue the matter a little further with him if he can look in here on Thursday. (That should be time enough, I think? The point is not likely to be taken during Supplementaries on the Prime Minister’s Statement on Thursday; but I agree that we ought to be ready for a subsequent debate.) 
evidence is as you describe it. 
Dick agrees that the line which he consistently maintained in his I don’t think that he would go so far as to 
say that the relevant passage in the Gardiner Report is wholly wrong - in the sense that there undoubtedly were occasions in the war when it was possible to obtain information which was required very urgently by methods which did not contravene the Geneva Convention. But he would still maintain that there was a radical difference between the circumstances in Ulster last August and the majority of comparable occasions during the war; that the former were, in some respects, more "urgent" than the latter; and that it is certainly misleading to imply that one can safely argue from wartime practice to a very different civil emergency. 
with him on Thursday if I can; and I will let you know the upshot. I am sending a copy of this letter to Philip Allen and to 
Stewart Crawford. I will pursue the point further Sir James Dunnett, GCB, CMG

E38/D/Min/RB/5 March , 1972 As requested in Cairncross’s letter to you yesterday notes 
for supplementaries on the SAS and the Moore Case are attached. These are incorporated with several other comments that we have on the Notes for Supplementaries already circulated. 
I am sorry the notes on the Moore case are long but it has 
been assumed that you have little information on it so far and it was necessary to give you some background. There are a number of questions that could arise other than those which were mentioned in GEN 77 yesterday. As you will see from our comments, the Prime Minister is recommended to avoid getting into the details of this case on the grounds that Moore was only detained for 48 hours and not subjected to interrogation in depth or the techniques discussed in the Parker Report. 
With regard to the notes on the supplementary dealing with 
the legal protection of servicemen I should add that this subject has been discussed between the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office, and it has been agreed that: 
a. We should not rule out civil actions against the Crown on account of deep interrogation (or other matters). Some 25 actions are pending, including 3 arising out of deep interrogation. We would, however, continue to protect the identities of the individuals concerned and their costs and any damages would be paid by the Crown. 
b. For the time being at least, we should do nothing about the possibility of privately initiated criminal proceedings. There have been no such proceedings to date. For deep interrogation the penalties would probably be nominal and the Crown could stand by the personnel as in civil actions. If the possibility of a more serious penalty such as imprisonment was involved we should resort to an Act of Indemnity on an individual basis. 
The additional note added to the Supplementary material sums this up. 
C.W. Roberts, Esq., Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, 0, Downing Street, ondon, S.W.1.

PRIME MINISTER NORTHERN IRELAND: SPECIAL COURTS The reason for internment is that while a good deal is 
known about internees, the evidence, such as it is, would not in most cases stand up in court according to normal legal tests; further, even if the evidence were sufficient, there would be obvious objections to disclosing its nature to the defence or allowing a confrontation between the security forces and the accused. It is, therefore, sometimes suggested that special courts should be set up with their own procedure so that in appropriate cases persons at present interned could be brought before them. I have now considered this matter further and consulted the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney General to see whether anything can be done to overcome our difficulties by setting up such courts. If the problem were simply that juries perversely 
refused to convict, it would be possible by legislation to dispense with the jury system in such cases and to substitute appointed judges, magistrates or assessors. This is broadly the procedure which has been adopted in the past in the Republic of Ireland. But the special courts there are

1 March, 1972 I enclose, as requested, a draft message from the 
Prime Minister to Mr. Lynch, on the subject of the Parker Report. 
on the subject of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, is also in hand. We propose that both messages should issue as soon as possible, but that the message about Soviet diplomatic relations should be delivered, not personally, on 1 March, to Mr. Lynch’s office. To delay longer might risk the message arriving after the decision had been taken. 
But the message about the Parker Report should be 
delivered, if previous practice is to be followed, in the early afternoon of Thursday, 2 March, i.e. an hour or so before the statement to the House. 
Delivery should, we 
suggest, if other pressures permit, be by the Ambassador to Mr. Lynch personally. On this occasion, points from both letters can be developed in discussion. 
I am sending copies of this letter to Graham Angel 
in the Home Office and Robert Andrew in the Ministry of Defence.

DRAFT MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO MR. LYNCH The report of the Committee of Privy 
Councillors on interrogation proceedings under the Chairmanship of Lord Parker is to be published on 2 March. It is being published in full; the Government made only minor amendments which do not in any way affect the sense. 
I have asked the 
Ambassador to give you a copy in advance. You will see that there was a majority and 
a minority report. The majority found that the methods in question, which had been applied on a number of occasions in the past under successive Governments in various parts of the world, were applied in Northern Ireland in August 1971 to 12 detainees and in October to two more. They concluded that the use of the measures involved could be justified in exceptional circumstances, subject to further safeguards. But they had doubts about the position in English law; they refrained from expressing any view about the position in Northern Ireland where legal proceedings which raise this issue are pending. Lord Gardiner’s minority report considered 
that the methods are objectionable in all circumstances. In this situation, the Government have 
decided that the techniques which the Committee examined will not be used in future as an aid to interrogation.
