LONG KESH CAMP Many thanks for your letter. 
I, too, am concerned 
at the delay in getting a decision to go ahead with Long Kesh Camp. 
The latest position is that there 
is a tiresome argument between MOD and. the Home Office as to which of them should pay for it, and no action to build it can start apparently until this argument is resolved. 
We have made it quite clear to all concerned that there is considerable urgency to get a decision over this and I very much hope that next week we shall get one. I shall be away until the end of the week and as soon as there is any progress I will get AUS(GS) to let you know..

MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 1st April, 1971 During the meeting of NI yesterday morning, the 
Defence Secretary mentioned that the GOC Northern Ireland had recently issued a directive on the policy for conducting operations; and I understand that the Prime Minister asked if he might see a copy. I attach 
a copy of this directive, which is dated 24th March; I am sorry that the print is rather faint. 
This directive is of course distinct from that 
which is issued to the GOC in his capacity as Director of Operations in Northern Ireland. I am not sure whether you have a copy of the current edition of the latter and I am therefore attaching a copy for easy reference. 
I am sending copies of this letter and of the enclosures to Graham Angel and Brian Norbury.

The Prime Minister, who was accompanied by the 
Home Secretary, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for Defence, discussed the situation in Northern Ireland today with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, the Right Honourable Brian Faulkner. 
The Chief of the General Staff, 
General Sir Michael Carver, and the General Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland, Lieutenant-General Tuzo, were also present. The meeting afforded an opportunity for a full 
exchange of views on all topics of mutual concern to the two Governments, particularly the effective and impartial enforcement of law and order and the intensification of the efforts to combat I.R.A. terrorism. It was accepted on both sides that the forces now available had the capability, within the ambit of agreed policy, to take all measures which would contribute to the ultimate objective of restoring peace and stability. The Prime Ministers also reviewed progress in the 
social and economic fields and reaffirmed their determination to persevere with policies designed to improve the conditions of life for the whole of the community of Northern Ireland. 
For this purpose they agreed to 
consider how best to carry out a joint reappraisal of the prospects for economic and social development in Northern Ireland in the light of the need to restore the confidence essential to industrial investment. 
They 
also undertook to consider the arrangements for keeping the Government of Northern Ireland closely in touch with the negotiations of the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Economic Communities.

SECURITY FORCES "CLOSE-IN" 
The Prime Minister has told Belfast businessmen that the police and Army were "making it hotter" for terrorists, and were beginning to "close-in" on Northern Ireland’s wanted men: 
In the past four weeks alone the security forces have searched more than 150 occupied houses, almost 600 unoccupied houses and stopped and checked 85,000 vehicles. As a result of this activity one machine gun, 11 rifles, 28 revolvers, 10 shotguns, almost 4,000 rounds of ammunition, almost 300 lb of explosives, 300 detonators and miscellaneous explosive materials have been seized. This represents real progress and one particular development, namely, the dumping of arms shows that many terrorists or would-be terrorists have been unnerved. This in itself is a most important development, for I believe there will be no end to terrorism until the subversionists are forced to the realisation - as they were at the end of the 1956-62 campaign 
- that they could mke no headway

MATTERS ARISING FROM THE DISCUSSIONS WITH MR FAULKNER ON 1ST APRIL 
1. 
Improved surveillance of the Border Terms of reference for a study by the GOC Northern Ireland of questions 
relating to the security of the land border were sent to him on 8th April, after interdepartmental discussion. A copy is attached. Customs prepared a detailed note, and the GOC has been told to consult 
the top Customs official in Northern Ireland in carrying out his study. The Home Office is currently considering the implications of raising a full-time Ulster Defence Regiment battalion. This would involve legislation. 
2. 
Curfews The GOC is considering greater use of curfews, in consultation with the 
Joint Security Committee. 3. 
Identity cards The Home Office has put to the Northern Ireland Government a possible 
scheme for the use of identity cards to improve the control of the Border. The views of the Northern Ireland Government are awaited. It is clear that they see difficulties. 
4. 
Contingency study on internment accommodation The results of the contingency study have been given to Northern Ireland. 
At a discussion with officials on 16th April, the Northern Ireland representatives said that (i) it was not practicable to plan to use prison accommodation for internees; (ii) there was much to be said for the use of "Maidstone" to meet a short-term emergency; and (iii) to construct an internment camp at Long Kesh represented the most feasible solution. They promised to obtain the

16 April 1971 
NORTHERN IRELAND POLITICAL SUMMARY 2-15 APRIL 1971 
FOR THE PERIOD Memorandum by the Home Office 
GENERAL SITUATION The Easter period of traditional parades, during which the 
probability of disturbances is inevitably increased, passed reasonably peacefully until Tuesday when an incident in Ballymacarrett (see paragraph 5 below) led to serious disturbances which are still going on, although on a smaller scale, and have been reflected by other minor incidents in the Shankill. The Ballymacarrett incident is the first flagrantly sectarian confrontation of any seriousness for some time. Its general significance is difficult to assess, given the special tension associated with the Easter parades and the peculiarly local factors which arose out of disturbances in the same area last year. In both the Ballymacarrett and Shankill areas there has been evidence since the incident of an increasing propensity for Protestant crowds to attack the military. Such attacks in Roman Catholic areas, particularly in Londonderry, have also continued. Although it seems certain that tension between the communities in parts of Belfast has been raised it is too soon to say how serious and lasting this effect will be. 
2. The continuing success of the security forces in finding arms 
and explosives, together with the significant arrests of three members of the Provisional IRA are brighter aspects of the week’s events. Stormont has not been sitting during the period, and the reactions of politicians will presumably not be aired until Parliament resumes on 20 April. Although there will no doubt be critics of the handling of particular events, it looks as if Mr. Faulkner will have plenty of information to which he may point to justify the claim that the security forces contained the situation successfully and are making good progress in other fields. Evidence of right-wing feeling in some areas came from the success of two Paisleyite candidates in elections to the Belfast Corporation during the week, but again it is difficult to say how far these results reflect the state of opinion generally

I am replying to your letter of yesterday’s date to Angel about 
JIC(A)(71)23, which reports on Northern Ireland intelligence arrangements. As I explained on the telephone, the position is complicated by the 
fact that J. A. McKay, H.M. Chief Inspector of Constabulary, is this afternoon leaving for Belfast to carry out a full inspection of the RUC. This will take him nearly a fortnight. It is the first time ever that the RUC has been inspected. McKay has been carefully briefed for this important visit; and he has, in particular, a considerable list of points affecting the Special Branch which he is to investigate. It seems to us that there is much to be said for seeing what success he has on the matters to which the Prime Minister has drawn special attention 
and that this approach is much in line with the general 
thesis of the Intelligence Co-ordinator’s report. It may be that McKay will be able to report that some of these points 
have been satisfactorily dealt with, but it is possible too that he will bring others to light which give cause for disquiet, and that an approach to Mr.Faulkner may then be called for. It is possible too that the examination of some of the outstanding recommendations made in the Intelligence Co-ordinator’s report, which is now going on, will suggest other points on which an approach to Mr.Faulkner may be advisable. We are extremely anxious to do everything possible further to develop 
the improving standards of the RUC Special Branch, but I venture to urge that, in the circumstances I have explained, it would be best to reserve any message from the Prime Minister himself until we have reports covering the whole ground and are sure that we are picking out for high level approach all the important issues which cannot be satisfactorily dealt with on a day-to-day working basis. I am sending copies of this letter to Burke Trend and to Stewart 
Crawford. Peter Moon, Esq.

Ref: A09473 PRIME MINISTER Northern Ireland The Official Committee on Northern Ireland met yesterday to 
review progress on matters arising from Mr. Faulkner’s visit. The GOC has already been asked to consider the greater use of 
curfews in consultation with the Northern Ireland authorities and to report back. The Official Committee settled the instructions to the GOC to study the complex of questions related to Border control - the cratering of roads and so forth; and Customs and Excise have been associated with the studies. The Northern Ireland Government have been told what would be involved in the use of identity cards and their views have been sought. (They may decide not to pursue the possibility, which does indeed involve great difficulty. ) The construction of a camp against the possibility of internment is under urgent consideration between the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence. 
The various suggestions made by the Intelligence Co-ordinator 
are being pursued; as you know, further military intelligence officers and liaison officers have already been posted to Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Government have asked the Home Secretary to 
hold his hand on the proposed joint economic study until they have had an opportunity to formulate their exact proposals and to suggest names for a leader. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary will be talking to the Chancellor of the Duchy on the EEC problems. The staff of the United Kingdom Representative is being 
augmented; and the Department of the Environment are actively searching for a suitable house. I will arrange for a fuller report of progress after Easter.

5 April, 1971. The Republic of Ireland In your letter of 31 March you recorded the Prime 
Minister’s comment on Dublin telegrams 105, 106 and 107; namely, "the sooner we get Lynch here, the better". 
We assume that the Prime Minister’s comment was 
prompted by the feeling that Mr. Lynch’s reaction to the message the Prime Minister had sent him on 17 March was inadequate, and that although Mr. Lynch’s public statements had been helpful, on the specific requests for action against the IRA the reply left much to be desired. 
As you know, at their meeting last October in New 
York the Prime Minister agreed to Mr. Lynch’s request that they should meet again in 1971. Hitherto we had been assuming that the further meeting would be in the autumn. But an earlier meeting could as well be arranged, and in the light of the recent changes at Stormont and increased IRA activities it makes good sense. However we think we should carefully avoid Easter and the period immediately after, and as carefully get the visit over well before July and August. During the first period we must anticipate heightened tension from the Roman Catholic marches, and similar tension from the Protestant marches in July/August. 
A "Summit" around either period, even if the visit had been announced well in advance, would still excite harmful 
speculation about a deal behind the backs of Stormont. Therefore early May seems best. (On 14 May the Anniversary Exhibition ’Ulster 71" opens, and may provoke some demonstration
