NIOM(72)39 NOTE OF A MEETING AT NOON ON 29 SEPTEMBER 
THE CONFERENCE 1. A brief report on the Conference was given. It was useful in so far as it 
clarified the areas of agreement and dissension among the three political parties whose representatives attended. All agreed there should be some form of regional assembly, but were against complete integration with the United Kingdom or the condominium solution. The Alliance and Northern Ireland Labour Parties were in favour of the diffusion. of power as between the majority and minority communities, but the Unionist proposals would continue to concentrate power in the hands of the majority party. 2. 
Mr Whitelaw’ statement at the. end of the conference pointed out that any 
settlement that was reached would have to take account of the interests of the UK. We had not only a large commitment in terms of money and troops, but also had to take account of internal and external security factors both for Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom as a whole THE SECURITY SITUATION 3. 
and the tribunal. 4. 
A report was given on the measures taken so far on setting up the commission Although the level of force reductions would be borne in mind when setting the 
date of the local elections, nothing could be decided at this stage as it depended on when the necessary legislation went through Parliament. FUTURE ACTION 5. 
A progress report would be given to GEN 79 on the content and timing of pub- 
lication of a Green Paper on proposals made at the Conference; and on the new interim measures for security.

NORTHERN IRELAND - WEEKLY OPSUM AND OUTLOOK - 29 SEPTEMBER 1972 Reference: A: A/BR/30/1/M04 dated 27 September 1972. 
1. Headquarters Northern Ireland weekly operational summary for the week ending 27 September 1972 was circulated under Reference A. An updating of the summary up to 0800 hrs Friday 29 September is attached at Annex A. 
2. The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. 
3. The weekly intelligence report as at 29 September 1972 has been issued separately. OUTLOOK 
4. Provisional IRA activity can be expected to continue at the present low level in Belfast where there are indications that 2 of the 3 battalions are very demoralised. The level of activity in rural areas may escalate as terrorists increasingly seek softer targets: reports that the Provisional IRA are planning to increase their attacks against the security forces in country areas have been received. In Londonderry City an increase in the level of terrorist activity may be expected following the return of Provisional leaders. 
5. The Official IRA seem likely to maintain their truce for the present, especially while they continue to benefit from their rival’s setbacks. However, there is an increasing likelihood of interfactional strife as the Provisionals become more aware of their diminishing position. 
6. Militant extreme Protestant action continues to offer a serious threat to security, particularly in the field of sectarian murders. It is probable that it will not be until there is some indication of the outcome of the Darlington talks that Protestant organisations will decide their line of action. The theme of the Vanguard rally on 30 September 1972 has yet to be determined, however, there is no intelligence that the occasion is intended to provoke trouble, but this is always a possiblity on dispersal, particularly at the interfaces in East Belfast.

Annex A to A/BR/30/1/M04 Dated 
HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 27 SEPTEMBER 1972 
INTRODUCTION 1. 
General. The week began with a feeling of apprehension over the increasing 
viciousness of attacks and anticipation of some dramatic incident arranged by any of the opposing extremist factions to demonstrate their power before the Constitutional Conference in Darlington. No attempt to influence the Conference materialised and the week has been quiet in urban areas though the Border continues to be the scene of ruthless terrorist activity, some of which was mounted from the Republic. In the Crossmaglen area a skilful ambush was mounted which led to the death of an Army officer and the wounding of one soldier and two policemen. Shooting incidents and bomb attacks remain at much the same level as the previous period though there has been an increase in incendiary devices planted, most of which have been discovered before detonation. The recovery during the period of 41 weapons and 6,844 rounds of ammunition (making an overall total since Op MOTORMAN was launched of over 380 weapons and 55,000 rounds of ammunition) is an indication not only of Security Forces success but also of the number and variety of weapons available to the terrorist. Forensic tests have proved at least 377 different weapons are currently in use in Belfast and this is probably well under half the number at present available to the Provisionals. The level of UDA militant activity has been low, though a number of bombs, most of which failed to ignite properly, were almost certainly the work of extreme Protestants. 
2. IRA Activity. Though the Russell Court Hotel bombing on 25 September was 
no doubt intended to remind those whose eyes are turned towards Darlington that the real power lies with the Provisionals, IRA terrorism has remained surprisingly low. Their morale is reported to be affected by continuing military domination and by interfactional, dialectic disputes. As the Provisionals in Belfast continue to be rounded up by the Security Forces the influence of the Officials is increasing. 
3. Extreme Protestant Activity. This heading is used because the dividing 
line between the activities of the militant UDA and the UVF is becoming increasingly ill-defined. There has been some local Protestant uneasiness at the activities of militant Protestant forces and, after six months of Direct Rule, there are clear indications of increasing sectarian strife, eg, the overt appearance of over 50 uniformed UVF at the funeral in Larne of a publicly acknowledged UVF member. UVF bombs have been planted during the week including an attempt to destroy a L 1/4 million Catholic Church and an attack on a Republican Social Club in Belfast. UDA patrols of Protestant areas have appeared daily throughout the Province and some of these, notably in Lisburn and Belfast, have been masked and armed with cudgels. In two incidents patrols were found in possession of pistols and arrests were made. 
4. Security Forces Activity. As information becomes increasingly available 
so the attrition of IRA resolve progresses. Weapon finds and arrests of IRA officers and volunteers have been responsible for the deterioration in the morale and effectiveness of two of the Provisional IRA battalions in Belfast. As the days get shorter our relatively much better night fighting capability will be to our advantage. Over 117,000 cars were checked during the period and some successful arrests coupled with patrolling throughout the Rural areas appear to have again forced the terrorist to operate from the Republic, flitting across the border to lay mines and shooting at the Security Forces. In Belfast continued progress has been made in establishing the acceptance of RMP/RUC patrols in the Ardoyne, Garnock

NOTE OF A MEETING AT NOON ON 22 SEPTEMBER 
OPERATIONS The member of the UDR who was murdered yesterday with his wife was killed 
by a group of about 10 men who came from the Republic and returned there. Whether this incident should be used by the Attorney General at Strasbourg, or in future discussions with the Irish Government, is being considered. 2. 
Two Customs Officers were kidnapped on Thursday morning. One is an RUC 
Reservist and the other a prosecution witness in a recent murder trial. 3. 
the bombing and sniping in Northern Ireland will continue. THE CONFERENCE 4. 
John Stephenson, speaking for the Provisionals in Dublin, has said that Information about the conference should be geared to showing that an 
opportunity is being provided for all points of view to be expressed, so that what flows from the conference will be seen to be the product of consultation. THE PROPOSED TRIBUNAL AND COMMISSION 5. 
Information about the tribunal should emphasise the steps that will be 
taken to separate the decision to detain a person from the executive. The detailed procedures for the tribunal have yet to be worked out between officials. PROSECUTIONS 6. 
Difficulties arise out of the preparation of criminal cases for prosecution 
in Northern Ireland. It may be that some legal advice within the RUC would improve this. The problem needs further consideration. STRASBOURG 7. 
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office have dealt with the security aspects of 
the hearings at Strasbourg next week. Daily reports of current events of importance will be sent from London. NEXT MEETING 8. 
The next meeting will be on Friday, 29 September at noon in Conference Room A. 22 September 1972 J F HALLIDAY

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 20 SEPTEMBER 1972 
INTRODUCTION 1. 
General. Provisional IRA activity has continued for the 
second week at a relatively low level. Nevertheless, interfactional disturbances in LARNE at the week-end were a depressing indication of the spread of sectarianism. Other serious incidents involving Protestant extremists have occurred in BELFAST and CARRICKFERGUS. After pressure from numerous sectors the LAW strike at the two power stations was called off and though the Parachute Regiment remain persona-non-grata to the UDA, the UDA have resumed ’diplomatic relations’ with the Security Forces. The Secretary of State has decided that no undue publicity advantage should be taken of this climbdown by LAW. Other significant events during the week included the arrest of 
(gunman 
and Provisional Company Commander), the Protestant bombing of a Catholic hotel and by no means least the recovery of a large amount of arms and ammunition. 
2. Force Levels. The next three weeks will see a reduction 
of one brigade headquarters and four major units.The result of this will be that by Thursday 28 September we shall be deployed on a three brigade basis with 39 Infantry Brigade responsible for the whole of BELFAST. By 9 October 39 Infantry Brigade will have eleven battalions, 8 Infantry. Brigade six battalions, 3 Infantry Brigade three battalions, with one Province Reserve battalion in addition. This represents a reduction of one brigade headquarters and six major units since Operation Motorman began. 
3. IRA Activity. The general reduction in shooting attacks 
may well be due to IRA employment of trained snipers who are expending at least half the previous weekly totals of ammunition for twice the casualty rate achieved. On the other hand rumour has it that the younger IRA men can see the end in sight and having lined their pockets are quietly withdrawing from the ranks. The propaganda campaign continues and in two most provocative statements the Provisionals accused the military of establishing military strongpoints in two hospitals and two cathedrals and claimed ’the right of assault’. The Officials continue to consolidate their political base and there is evidence to support their claim that they are weaning support away from the Provisionals. Relations between the two factions have not improved. 
4. Protestant Activity. A number of events have confirmed 
the increasing participation of extremists in acts of terrorism normally the province of the IRA. Two men, one a UDA Company Commander, have been charged with attempted murder after a shooting incident. In LARNE petrol bombings and subsequent shooting was clearly UVF-inspired, and there is strong circumstantial evidence to indicate that Protestants planted the bomb which virtually demolished the Imperial Hotel in BELFAST on 14 September. Intelligence does not confirm Gusty Spence’s claim that the UVF has a total strength of 1,500 in BELFAST organised into 3 battalions.

Having seen 4 men in Andmonagh Gardens, the patrol chased them into Falls Park but were ambushed. One hit was claimed.

(1) At 0950 hrs, Mr Patrick MACKIE, director of a Belfast Engineering Company, was kidnapped in his car at the junction of Falls Road/Beechmount Avenue, while waiting at the traffic lights. Three armed men were involved. This was not an attempt to take him personally, only the car being required. Upon realising his identity the kidnappers took Mr MACKIE to Lang’s Yard, New Beechmount and then an unknown house in the same area, where he was held during the rest of the day, a total of about eight hours. While at the house he was kept in a bedroom, and engaged in conversation on political topics by a succession of 8 men over the course of the afternoon. His attackers identified themselves as a part of a combined Irish Front with Protestants against the PARAS. They explained that the PARAS and the Royal Green Jackets are particularly disliked because they are more aggressive than other units. Other reports suggest the men belong to SAOR EIRE, a right wing republican movement.

NOTE OF A MEETING AT NOON ON 19 SEPTEMBER 
POSSIBLE NEW LEGAL MEASURES A report has been prepared by officials following the discussion 
by Ministers last week, and it, together with a Memorandum from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, will be circulated for the further discussions due to take place later this week. 
will be whether any announcement of conclusions should be made before the Conference, and if so how those conclusions should be communicated to the Government of the Irish Republic and the S.D.L.P. 2. 
One question to be considered If there is to be any dismantling of the Special Powers Act discussions 
will be necessary between the Northern Ireland Office and Ministry of Defence. ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT 3. 
The Northern Ireland Office is in touch with the Ministry of Defence 
about members of the U.D.R. who become involved with the Ulster Defence Association, and, in particular, three members of the Regiment who were involved in recent court proceedings. OPERATIONS AND INTELLIGENCE 4. 
Violence has continued to be at a relatively low level, but casualties to the security forces remain serious. 
Reasons for the lull are uncertain. 
Operation Motorman has had some effect, as has the comparative loss of public support for the Provisionals, who are not as yet doing much to counter this. There may also be some uncertainity in the Provisionals’ own ranks about future policy. 
But the possibility that they are planning a major act of 
terrorism cannot be ruled out. 5. 
a united front. 
Protestant militants remain divided, in spite of recent efforts to present The leadership has talked of restoring relations with the 
security forces, but it is no longer certain that the leadership can control small groups of extremists. NEXT MEETING 6. 
The next meeting is due to take place on Friday, 22 September, at noon in

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 150700 to 180700 HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
The level of violence was, low throughout the weekend. On Fri/Sat there 
were 39 shootings one explosion; on Sat/Sun 20 shootings 4 explosions; on Sun Mon 17 shootings 2 explosions. Casualties totalled one soldier died of wounds received on 24 Aug and 9 wounded, 4 of them very seriously; one civilian died of wounds, 2 women were shot through the legs possibly as a form of IRA punishment and 2 other civilians were hurt in other incidents; as for terrorists, Security Forces claimed 3 hits in Catholic areas on Fri/Sat, 2 in Belfast and one in Londonderry; RUC shot dead a Protestant in Larne on Sat/Sun, and 1 Coldm Gds shot an IRA gunman dead in South Creggan on Sun/Mon and subsequently recovered his body but not his weapon. BELFAST again saw most of the action. The UDA/LAW and VANGUARD rallies on Saturday were attended by 5-6000 people, of whom 1500 were masked, and caused little stir except for press comment in the Republic. LONDONDERRY was again quiet except for some sniping and rioting on Sun/Mon, perhaps as a reaction to the UDA/LAW rally in Belfast the day before. There were no Border incidents. In the Countryside, probably the most significant incident of the weekend occurred on Saturday at LARNE between some UDA/Tartans and RUC, later assisted by Army detachments. It appears that the origins of the incident were intersectarian with no intention of involving Security Forces but the incident got out of hand. COS HQ Northern Ireland regards it as ’a hiccup’. In GB, weekend press comment was varied and off the headlines. 2. During Fri/Sat (15/16 Sep 72) there were 39 shooting incidents, 31 of which involved SF. 4 soldiers were injured, 1 of them seriously and it is believed that 3 gunmen were hit. A soldier injured in the Bogside on 24 Aug 72, died of his wounds. A 90 year old woman injured in an explosion on 14 Sep 72, died in hospital. The RVH OP came under fire several times during the period but there were no SF casualties. A 60 lb bomb exploded in Castle St (New Lodge) and 300 lbs of explosives were found in a derelict house in the Ardoyne. In Londonderry there were 3 shooting incidents and SF claimed 1 hit. There was rioting in Strabane and 2 shops were damaged by incendiary devices in Portadown. The houses of an officer and an NCO of 2 UDR were raided by masked men and 2 weapons, some ammunition and uniforms were stolen. £5250 was stolen from a Post Office in Dunadry (Co Antrim). 
3. During Sat/Sun (16/17 Sep 72) there were 20 shooting incidents, 14 of which involved SF. A soldier in Belfast was shot in the neck and stomach and is VSI. A civilian is believed to have been injured after a shooting incident in Belfast. In Larne there was rioting by Protestants, and SF came under fire. The son of a local UD leader was killed when RUC returned fire. Several electricity transformers/pylons were damaged in four explosions in different parts of the Province. In Belfast the UDA/LAW and Vanguard rallies were attended by approximately 6000 people and passed off without serious incident. Londonderry was extremely quiet and there was only one shooting incident; a 12 year old girl was grazed on the hand by a ricochet. A 200 lb explosive device was destroyed by ATO near Forkill.

A. A/BR/30/1/M04 dated 13 September 1972. 1. 
Headquarters Northern Ireland weekly operational summary for 
the week ending 13 September 1972 was circulated under Reference A. An updating of the summary up to 0800 hrs Friday 15 September is attached at Annex A. 
2. 3. 
The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. The weekly intelligence report as at 8 September 1972 has been 
issued separately. OUTLOOK 4. 
As the date for the Secretary of State’s conference approaches 
both Provisional IRA and Protestant extremist groups must be expected to attempt to carry out activity designed to show that without their participation the conference cannot be expected to succeed. 
5. The Provisional IRA, which has conducted activity at a low 
level during the last few weeks, must be expected to raise this level. In this they are likely to further concentrate attacks on the security forces, and a bombing offensive prior to the conference cannot be ruled out. 
6. The UDA is likely to concentrate on its propaganda campaign 
in an effort to embarrass the security forces, and less on street activity. Nonetheless, it is far from being a monolithic organisation and individual groups may seek a confrontation with the army.

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 13 SEPTEMBER 1972 
INTRODUCTION 
1. General. A number of events have held the headlines on the Irish scene during this period. The Protestant rioting of the first three nights of last week culminated inevitably in shooting between the Security Forces and UVF - 
inspired 
extremists in which two Protestants were killed and two wounded. Despite the deaths of 3 soldiers over the weekend caused by a Provisional mine, petulant Protestants are prepared to strike and demonstrate for the removal of the regiment they consider responsible for the deaths of their so-called innocent citizens. Much of the current terrorist activity is designed to promote the power of the faction concerned prior to the Secretary of State’s talks and, just as the UVF - 
inspired 
action was set up to show the strength of the Protestant front, further IRA atrocities can be expected to attempt to prove their domination of events. An extension of this ’jockeying’ is the emergence, after weeks of disarray, of a new hard line Protestant political party which unites the Vanguard, the para-military Ulster Defence Association and the Loyalist Association of Workers. It was significant that the tragedy of Munich aroused universal anger and condemnation even though Northern Ireland had endured death and destruction on a far greater scale without the spontaneous outflow of sympathy and the creation of the will to act internationally against terrorism. 
2. IRA Activity. Despite reports that the Provisional IRA campaign in Ulster would be intensified in order to disrupt the Secretary of State’s conference, it has remained subdued. The level of bomb attacks and snipings have remained at much the same level as last week. With the exception of the mining of a Saracen near Dungannon the Border has been virtually free of serious incidents. Although 8 soldiers were injured in 132 urban sniping incidents, there are indications that in Belfast the IRA’s reduced activity may be due to low morale in their battalions caused by the continued pressure of the current phase of Operation Motorman. 
3. Protestant Activity. Militant Protestant activity has dominated the situation during the week. On 7 September two civilians were shot dead and two wounded in the Shankill after Security Forces came under fire. In a statement on 8th September the UDA denied ’official involvement’ in the shooting although it was implicitly admitted that individual members acting without authority might have been involved. Nevertheless the UDA have used the incident to boost their flagging support and their already active propaganda campaign against the Security Forces. Furthermore, in a protest at the continued presence of the Parachute Regiment in the Shankill, the Belfast East and West Power Stations, largely staffed by member of LAW, are on strike. The activities of the UDA continue to pose a threat in the Portadown area; a number of cases of intimidation of Catholic families combined with a less friendly demeanour toward the Security Forces are all indications of the changed mood. 
4. Security Forces Activity. The domination of hard Catholic areas continues. Detention orders have been signed on a number of Provisionals. Large hauls of firearms and ammunition have been recovered in search operations which have become increasingly successful as more information is received from those members of the public who are becoming increasingly disaffected with the IRA.Battalions are beginning to know who and what is in their areas and the coming weeks should see more arrests and hence further inroads will be made into the IRA organisation. Patrolling continues in Border and Rural areas and, despite the tragic mining incident on Sunday, their success maybe measured in the significant reduction in explosives used, in the increased routine finds and the arrest figures produced by intensive alert patrolling.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 080700 to 110700 HOURS SEPTEMBER 1972 GENERAL 
1. After the Shankill confrontation on Thursday and the march to Tennent Street RUC station by 350 workers from Harland and Wolff on Friday, the weekend turned out to be relatively quiet, considering the potentially explosive situation. For the second successive weekend the level of violence was higher on Sat/Sun (approx 40 shooting 
incidents - 31 of 
them in Belfast - and 1 explosion) compared with Fri/Sat (24 shootings 3 explosions) and Sun/Mon (20 shootings 2 explosions . Casualties totalled 3 soldiers killed and 9 wounded; 1 RUC wounded 3 civilians injured, and 1 terrorist claimed hit. BELFAST saw most of the action.

70 yards away. It killed 2 and wounded 3 A & SH soldiers in a Saracen. One of the wounded subsequently died. On the border the newly built Customs post at Auchnacley was destroyed again. In GB weekend press comment concentrated on the deterioration in relations between tho Protestant community and the Army in general and 1 PARA in particular. The News of the World had banner headlines concerning an autumn IRA bombing campaign in GB . The Sunday Tele graph carri ed a revealing biography of John Stephenson. 
2. During Fri/Sat 8/9 Sep 72. It was quiet in Ulster except in Belfast where a march of about 350 workers from Harland and Wolff to the Tennent St RUC station had all the makings of a possible serious disturbance.

Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for developments in the political and security fields. SECURITY 2. 
3-4,000 shipyard 
There was a general discussion of the latest activities of the UDA following the incidents on 7 September in which 2 men were killed. 
workers plan to hold a march on the afternoon of the 8th September as a gesture of solidarity. 
FUTURE IRA TACTICS 4. 
There could either be a cease-fire or an intensification of the campaign 
in the time before the conference, but owing to the lack of a coherent organisation or body of opinion within the IRA, prophesy was difficult. 
A ceasefire, however, 
would be unlikely to have any effect on current arrest policy. NEXT MEETINGS 5. 
The meetings on 12 and 15 September will be in Conference Room B.

1. Headquarters Northern Ireland weekly operational summary for the week ending 6 September 1972 was circulated under Reference A. An updating of the summary up to 0800 hrs Friday 8 September is attached at Annex A. 
2. The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. 
3. The weekly intelligence report as at 8 September 1972 has been issued separately. OUTLOOK 
4. The effect on the level of terrorist activity of any internal debate within the Provisional IRA as a result of recent press articles is difficult to estimate, and will clearly depend upon whether there is rank and file reaction to these events possibly leading to a leadership struggle. As yet there is no intelligence to indicate this happening. However, the Provisional IRA must be expected to carry out some offensive if they are not to lose the initiative completely. 
5. The Officials can be expected to try to take advantage of any long or short term embarrassment felt by the Provisionals, as a result of the recut disclosures. 
6. The UDA must be expected to attempt to further embarrass and harass the security forces as the talks on the future of Northern Ireland approach. Reports have been received that their activities will be stepped up later this month.

Annex A to A/BR/30/1/M04 Dated 7 September 1972 
UPDATING POINTS FOR HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY AS AT FRIDAY 8 SEPTEMBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
The main development of the period has been clear evidence of 
increased Protestant terrorist activity, notably the Shankill gunbattle between Protestants and Army patrols on Thursday night and the significant find of arms and explosive on Thursday which led to the arrest of 16 Protestants. 
TERRORIST ACTIVITY 2. 
IRA a. 
Some 62 shooting incidents have occurred, mostly involving the IRA, 
a considerable increase over the previous period. There has been a total of 9 bomb incidents (of all types), 3 on Wednesday, 5 on Thursday, only 3 in Belfast. The 2 bombs in Londonderry on Thursday are a significant increase. 
b. c. The Provisionals have denied reports of a leadership or loyalty crisis. An unusual tactic was revealed by the discovery of a tunnel dug from 
an RC house in Belfast towards an Army OP. d. 
3. 
Protestant a. 
In a border incident on Thursday, 2 soldiers of 1A and SH were wounded 
when their patrol was ambushed. A rifle and ammunition was recovered 50m across the border, with the cooperation of the Garda. 
The major gunbattle between 1 PARA and Protestant gunmen in the Shankill 
which lasted from 2020 to 2110 on Thursday, was initiated by the gunmen as UDA hooligans withdrew. 2 Protestants were killed and 2 received GSW; a further hit is claimed. The situation was cooled after CO 1 PARA had spoken to Anderson but the atmosphere was explosive for a time. The large quantity of equipment recovered from UDA HQ in Wilton Street included a sniperscope, bomb-making gear, ammunition, medical kit and radios. 
b. The significant find (8 assorted weapons, explosives, uniform, a radio 
and stolen cars) in Monkstown by 40 Cdo acting on RUC information, led to the arrest on Thursday of 16 Protestants all of whom have been charged and remanded in custody. 3 of them are UDR soldiers. 
c. Incidents of UDA masked and cudgelled activity occurred on both days 
in Belfast, much of it ostensibly to protect schoolchildren. Outside Belfast, militant activity has been negligible, but 100 UDA ran riot for a time in Portadown on Thursday evening 2 Protestants were arrested and later released pending summons. 
4. Other. Intersectarian or motiveless murders continue the bodies of 2 
Protestants were discovered on Wednesday/Thursday night. Incidents of juvenile hooliganism have continued, mostly in Belfast. 
SECURITY FORCES 5. 
There have been no significant changes in deployment or profile. While 
Catholic attitudes towards Security Forces remain unchanged, the attitude of the UDA, notably in Belfast, appears to have hardened considerably.

HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY FOR THE WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY 6 SEPTEMBER 1972 
Introduction 1. 
Provisional IRA. The shooting incidents continue to increase with sniping 
at patrols and sentries. Since 1 August there have been 174 single shot engagements at the Security Forces in which 8 soldiers were killed and 16 wounded. Security Force casualties, although lower than in any of the last 4 weeks, remain high at 3 killed and 11 wounded. This is an indication of the slightly reduced tempo of IRA operations brought about by extensive patrolling, made possible by the present force levels, which inhibits the movement of weapons, gunmen and explosives. Following the recent pronouncements by the Provisional IRA about the intensification of their campaign this is a welcome development. It may also be that recent adverse publicity has aggravated existing disagreements within the movement over present policy. 
2. Official IRA. They have threatened through the media to take "defensive 
action" against the UDA in Co TYRONE for alleged attacks on civilians. They would not consider this to be a breach of their truce. 
Security Force Activity 3. 
The Security Forces have continued to make inroads on the Provisional IRA 
and a number of Provisional officers have been arrested including engineering officer of 1 Bn who is believed to be responsible for a number of sophisticated devices which have been used recently in Andersonstown. Four Provisionals were arrested by the RUC in Londonderry on 1 September in the act of robbing a Savings Bank. Over 20 Provisional Officers have now been charged since the beginning of Operation MOTORMAN and 9 have been detained. 
4. The planned move out of the schools in Londonderry and West Belfast has been 
completed. Troops remain in part of St Genevieves, Oliver Plunkett and St Peters Schools and at the beginning of the Auntumn Term on Monday 4 September school attendance was minimal. These schools will continue to be a source of propaganda for the Provisionals until alternative accommodation is obtained. Work has started on a new camp to replace the accommodation currently provided by St Genevieves School,and should be available by mid October. 
5. Security Force casualties for August totalled 20 killed (including 3 UDR) 
and 77 wounded (including 7 UDR and 4 RUC). These figures are amongst the highest for any comparable period since the beginning of this campaign. 
6. Following reports of UDA patrols in the MAGHERA/DESERTMARTIN area Security 
Force patrols were increased and only one UDA road block was reported. This dispersed when ordered to do so by an Army patrol. A patrol of 1 PARA arrested a man armed with a pistol who was later identified as 
(self styled 
Lt Col in the UDA). This arrest was followed by attempts by ANDERSON of the UDA to negotiate his immediate release. DOYLE has appeared in court and has been remanded in custody until 8 September. Following the discovery of a hand grenade in a car in Lisburn three Protestans were arrested, one of whom has been charged and remanded in custody. These arrests have led to the UDA accusing the Security Forces of harassment.

NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION REPORT FOR THE PERIOD 010700 TO 040700 SEPTEMBER 72 1. 
GENERAL. The level of violence was low on Fri/Sat (18 shootings 4 
explosions) and Sun/Mon (16 shootings 2 explosions) but higher than usual on Sat/Sun (55 shootings 38 in Belfast nil explosions). In all one soldier was killed (accidentally); three soldiers and one RUC constable were wounded; and six civilains were hurt. In Belfast at 0410 hrs on Sunday morning two patrols met in 40 Cdo area (NEW LODGE) and engaged one another accidentally. Gnr CUTTING (7 Bty RA att 40 Cdo) was killed and one gunner and one marine were wounded. On Sunday afternnon in Andersonstown both Catholic civil rights movements supported by a number of parents and teachers, in all about 400, demonstrated against continued use by Security Forces of Catholic schools. (Term begins again today 4 Sep). Londonderry was quiet, as was the border. In the countryside, there were a few assorted incidents, mostly in Portadown. In Great Britain, weekend press comment featured the disclosures of the Provisional defector 
, whose position in law is unclear - she 
is reportedly wanted by Interpol in connection with the attempt to fly Czech arms through Amsterdam on 16 Oct 1971. The main points she made were that there is a power struggle within the Provisional leadership, who are under pressure to call off the bombing compaign; that a real power resides in the hands of Stephenson ( a bigoted murderer) in Dublin, and Toomey in Belfast, where the dynamic for the whole campaign exists; that anger among Northern Catholics in general has been growing because of the political sterility of a purely terrorist policy; and that the IRA must call a cease fire and talk, while HMG must realise that the IRA must have a place at some ultimate conference table. In the Republic, the Provisionals issued a statement dismissing the allegations made in England by Maria McGuire, claiming that she was of no consequence in the organisation and knew little of significance. 
Elsewhere, Mr Heath meets Mr Lynch today 4 Sep in Munich at the Olympic Games. 2. During FRI/SAT 1/2 SEP 72 the Province was quiet. There were 17 shooting 
incidents of which 14 involved the Security Forces. A Corporal in 40 Cdo was wounded in the leg by gunfire. There was one explosion, and ATO detonated 3 devices. There was a spate of arson in Portadown, thought to be an attempt by Protestants to set up an intersectarian clash. 
3. During SAT/SUN 2/3 SEP 72 there was a marked increase in shooting and in 
Belfast the level was the highest since Motorman. However there were no explosions, although there was a spate of incendiary attacks against Protestant owned shops in Ballymena In an incident in Belfast 2 patrols mistook each other for gunmen and exchanged fire; one soldier was killed and two wounded. Elsewhere two soldiers, and an RUC constable were wounded one of whom was on leave. Four civilians wore wounded and 4 hits were claimed. 
4. During SUN/MON 3/4 SEP 72 there were fewer incidents than the day before. 
There were 16 shooting incidents of which Security Forces were involved in 12. There were two explosions. There were no Security Force casualties or hits claimed, but two civilians were wounded in Belfast. There was a demonstration in Andersonstown against the use of schools by Security Forces. In Co Londonderry UDR fired over the heads of an angry crowd at a VCP; Bernadette Devlin rang HQ Northern Ireland 
hat they were firing at the crowd.

Reference: A. A/BR/30/1/M04 dated 30 August 1972. 
1. Headquarters Northern Ireland weekly operAtional summary for the week ending 30 August 1972 was circulated under Reference A. An updating of the summary up to 0800hrs Friday 1 September is attached at Annex A. 
2. The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. 
3. The weekly intelligence report as at 1 September 1972 has been issued separately. OUTLOOK 
4. The Provisional IRA are likely to seek an intensification of the campaign: in this it is likely that they will concentrate of sniping in all areas and mine attacks against the Security Forces. Explosive attacks against commercial targets will continue, and an attempt may be made to carry out a "spectacular" operation or series of operation, aimed at obtaining maximum media coverage. It is likely that Belfast city centre could be a target in such an attack. 
5. Intimidation in Republican areas may increase as the terrorists continue to be alienated from the minority. 
6. There are some indications of splits within the Officials, but no evidence that significant numbers intend to resume militant activities. 
7. There remains the possibility of Protestant bomb attacks being mounted: however, the majority of the Protestant population will continue to show restraint, especially while their leadership remains fragmented.

A/BR/30/1/M04 Dated 1 September 1972 
UPDATING POINTS FOR HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN IRELAND OPERATIONAL SUMMARY AS AT FRIDAY 1 SEPTEMBER 1972 
GENERAL 1. 
IRA Activity. Concerted efforts have been made by the Provisionals to 
renew offensive operations in Londonderry. Four bombs were placed in Strand Road/Waterloo Place on 31 August. All are believed to have been smuggled through check points by girls. There are obvious difficulties in searching female for small quantities of explosives (however steps are being taken to reinforce WRAC Provcet). Attacks on Customs Posts continue and further successful bomb attacks are being made on public utility installations around Strabane. The Provisional IRA continue to carry out sniping attacks. 
2. Protestant Activity. The Protestant organisation remain outwardly subdued however the shooting of two Catholics in the Shankill area seems to be the work of a Protestant extremist organisation. The shooting of a young Catholic in Rugby Road, a mixed area, could have been carried out by extremists of either faction. He is believed to have been a drug taker and this could have provided an excuse for his killing. 
3. Security Forces Activity. RUC mobile patrols continue in the Bogside and Creggan and RMP continue to patrol all Catholic areas throughout the Province. Three Protestant weapons have been seized and one armed Protestant was arrested in Portadown. This caused an immediate reaction from a large crowd of Protestants but the Security Forces succeeded in cooling the situation down. Arms and explosives finds were made in Andersonstown, Falls Rd and the Coalisland area.

NOTE OF A MEETING AT NOON ON 22 SEPTEMBER 
OPERATIONS The member of the UDR who was murdered yesterday with his wife was killed 
by a group of about 10 men who came from the Republic and returned there. Whether this incident should be used by the Attorney=General at Strasbourg, or in future discussions with the Irish Government, is being considered. 2. 
Two Customs Officers were kidnapped on Thursday morning. One is an RUC 
Reservist and the other a prosecution witness in a recent murder trial. 3. 
the bombing and sniping in Northern Ireland will continue. THE CONFERENCE 4. 
John Stephenson, speaking for the Provisionals in Dublin, has said that Information about the conference should be geared to showing that an 
opportunity is being provided for all points of view to be expressed, so that what flows from the conference will be seen to be the product of consultation. THE PROPOSED TRIBUNAL AND COMMISSION 5. 
Information about the tribunal should emphasise the steps that will be 
taken to separate the decision to detain a person from the executive. The detailed procedures for the tribunal have yet to be worked out between officials. PROSECUTIONS 6. 
Difficulties arise out of the preparation of criminal cases for prosecution 
in Northern Ireland. It may be that some legal advice within the RUC would improve this. The problem needs further consideration. STRASBOURG 7. 
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office have dealt with the security aspects of 
the hearings at Strasbourg next week. Daily reports of current events of importance will be sent from London. NEXT MEETING 8. 
The next meeting will be on Friday, 29 September at noon in Conference Room 22 September 1972

Reference: A. 
1. A/BR/30/1/M04 dated 20 September 1972. Headquarters Northern Ireland weekly operational summary for 
the week ending 20 September 1972 was circulated under Reference A. An updating of the summary up to 0800 hrs Friday 22 September is attached at Annex A. 
2. 3. The forecast of events for the weekend is at Annex B. The weekly intelligence report as at 22 September 1972 has been 
issued seperately. OUTLOOK 4. 
22 SEPTEMBER 1972 The outlook remains as for last week. As the date for the Secretary 
of State’s conference approaches so extremist groups must be expected to demonstrate their ability to influence events in the Province and thus point up their non-participation at the conference. 
5. There are indications that the Provisional IRA are becoming increasingly 
isolated and demoralised by security force domination; however, it requires only a few determined terrorists to carry out an action designed to show that without their participation the conference cannot be expected to succeed. 
6. 7. The Official IRA will continue to gain from Provisional failures, and 
are expected to continue to try to exert their influence in the Provisional areas of Belfast.

21 September 1972 
When the Prime Minister saw the representatives of the Social Democratic and Labour Party at Chequers last week he said that he would try to give them a written reply this week to their main point that internment should be ended immediately. 
As you will appreciate the Prime Minister’s reply has been dependent on today’s meeting of GEN 79. We understand that the SDLP are still anxious to attend the conference and are hoping for a reply tomorrow. We therefore suggest that the Prime Minister should write to Mr Gerry Fitt MP as follows: 
"When I met representatives of the Social Democratic and Labour Party at Chequers last week I promised to let you have the Government’s response to their request for an immediate end to internment. 
You will by now be aware of the statement issued last night by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on security policy, of which I attach a copy. I hope that in these circumstances your Party will now feel able to attend the conference next week". 
Could you please let me know as soon as possible whether the Prime Minister is prepared to write in these terms. If he is we shall, if you agree, arrange for the terms of the letter to be conveyed by telephone to the SDLP in Northern Ireland.

GEN 79 Meeting - 21st September There will be three memoranda before the Meeting, 
GEN 79(72) 22 is a report by officials on the alternative measures for dealing with terrorists which were discussed at the last meeting of GEN 79. GEN 79(72) 21 embodies the Secretary of State’s policy proposals and a draft Press release. GEN 79(72) 20 contains the comments of the Attorney General. 2. 
The report by officials discusses two alternative courses. 
Course I is a special tribunal, with special rules of evidence, which would award sentences of preventive detention. Course II consists of two parts: a "Nuremberg trial" procedure, which would decide whether an organisation was a criminal organisation; and a special court of judges, with special rules and procedures, empowered to arraign alleged members of an organisation which had been declared to be criminal; to convict them of criminal offences; and to impose determinate sentences on them. The "Nuremberg trial" concept, however, is not essential to the operation of special courts; and in paragraph 4 of their report officials suggest that this part of the proposal should not be pursued - 
not least because the IRA 
might choose to defend itself and this could lead to considerable political embarrassment. 3. 
The Attorney General finds that both courses are "necessarily 
contrary to natural justice" (paragraph 5 of his memorandum); and he and Mr. Shaw, the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland, are of the opinion that, if Mr. Shaw were to be involved in either of them, this would be incompatible with the independence and impartiality of his office and with his paramount duty to act - and to be seen to act - in accordance with natural justice. For similar reasons the Attorney General feels that his own independent position as Attorney General for Northern Ireland would be seriously prejudiced if we were to be responsible in any way for the establishment or conduct of the new procedures. He cannot regard Course II, the establishment of a special court, as acceptable; and he therefore supports Course I.

His attackers identified themselves as a part of a combined Irish Front with Protestants against the PARAS. They explained that the PARAS and the Royal Green Jackets are particularly disliked because they are more aggressive than other units. Other reports suggest the men belong to SAOR EIRE, a right wing republican movement.

Reasons for the lull are uncertain. 
Operation Motorman has had some effect, as has the comparative loss of public support for the Provisionals, who are not as yet doing much to counter this. There may also be some uncertainity in the Provisionals’ own ranks about future policy. 
But the possibility that they are planning a major act of 
terrorism cannot be ruled out. 5.

GENERAL 1. 
The level of violence was low throughout the weekend. On Fri/Sat there 
were 39 shootings one explosion; on Sat/Sun 20 shootings 4 explisions; on Sun/ Mon 17 shootings 2 explosions. Casualties totalled one soldier died of wounds received on 24 Aug and 9 wounded, 4 of them very seriously; one civilian died of wounds, 2 women were shot through the legs possibly as a form of IRA punishment and 2 other civilians were hurt in other incidents; as for terrorists, Security Forces claimed 3 hits in Catholic areas on Fri/Sat, 2 in Belfast and one in Londonderry; RUC shot dead a Protestant in Larne on Sat/Sun, and 1 Coldm Gds shot an IRA gunman dead in South Creggan on Sun/Mon and subsequently recovered his body but not his weapon.

The UDA/LAW and VANGUARD rallies on Saturday were attended by 5-6000 people, of whom 1500 were masked, and caused little stir except for press comment in the Republic. LONDONDERRY was again quiet except for some sniping and rioting on Sun/Mon, perhaps as a reaction to the UDA/LAW rally in Belfast the day before. There were no Border incidents. In the Countryside, probably the most significant incident of the weekend occurred on Saturday at LARNE between some UDA/Tartans and RUC, later assisted by Army detachments. It appears that the origins of the incident were intersectarian with no intention of involving Security Forces but the incident got out of hand. COS HQ Northern Ireland regards it as ’a hiccup’. In GB, weekend press comment was varidd and off the headlines. 2. During Fri/Sat (15/16 Sep 72) there were 39 shooting incidents, 31 of which involved SF. 4 soldiers were injured, 1 of them seriously and it is believed that 3 gunmen were hit.

A 60 lb bomb exploded in Jastle St (New Lodge) and 300 lbs of explosives were found in a derelict house in the Ardoyne. In Londonderry there were 3 shooting incidents and SF clAimed 1 hit. There was rioting in Strabane and 2 shops were damaged by incendiary devices in Portadown. The houses of an officer and an NCO of 2 UDR were raided by masked men and 2 weapons, some ammunition and uniforms were stolen. £5250 was stolen from a Post Office in Dunadry (Co Antrim). 
3. During Sat/Sun (16/17 Sep 72) there were 20 shooting incidents, 14 of which involved SF. A soldier in Belfast was shot in the neck and stomach and is VSI.

The son of a local UDA leader was killed when RUC returned fire. Several electricity transformers/pylons were damaged in four explosions in different parts of the Province. In Belfast the UD/LAW and Vanguard rallies were attended by approximately 6000 people and passed off without serious incident. Londonderry was extremely quiet and there was only one shooting incident; a 12 year old girl was grazed on the hand by a ricochet. A 200 lb explosive device was destroyed by ATO near Forkill.

RECORD OF A DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF SWEDEN AT CHEQUERS AT 3.00 PM 
The Prime Minister explained the background to the 
present situation in Northern Ireland and the progress which had been made in recent months since the United Kingdom Government had assumed full responsibility for the government of Northern Ireland. He referred in passing to the 
tendentious treatment of the problem by the Swedish media. He emphasised the immense technical difficulties of dealing with the type of urban guerilla campaign which the Provisional IRA had been waging. In this connexion we had been disturbed to find that the IRA had been using dum-dum bullets of Swedish manufacture. While we realised the difficulties of imposing effective control over sales of ammunition, we hoped that the Swedish Government would consider tightening their existing regulations as a matter of urgency. Mr. Palme said that he was grateful for the Prime 
Minister’s explanation of the Northern Ireland situation. Although he was not by nature a reticent person, he had never expressed any views in public on the substance of this problem which he regarded as one of the most difficult which any government had to deal with. His line was that it was an internal British affair. He knew that we were concerned at what we considered to be biased reporting by the Swedish media. But for the Swedish Government to attempt to interfere with the media over this would merely cause major controversy and set a precedent which others would not hesitate to seek to explicit. Our Embassy in Stockholm had direct access to the Swedish media and it was of course open to the Embassy to avail themselves thereof at any time. 
to hear of our complaint about the use by the IRA of Swedish-manufactured dum-dum bullets. This had not previously been reported to him. He would look into the

STATEMENT BY LORD WINDLESHAM IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS ON MONDAY, 11th SEPTEMBER 
I will, with the leave of the House, make a statement about the situation in Northern Ireland. Since 
the House went into recess on 11th August operations by the security forces against the terrorists in Northern Ireland have been maintained at a high level. 
In the 
period between Operation Motorman on 31st July and 8th September 127 persons have been brought before the Courts and charged with offences related to terrorist activities. 
Arms finds 
have included 70 machine guns, 150 rifles, 108 pistols, 24,500 rounds of ammunition and approximately 71/2 tons of explosives. 
There has in recent weeks been a reduction in 
the number of bombing incidents,although the security forces continue to suffer casualties from bombing and sniping attacks made directly on them. 
But action against terrorism is not enough by itself 
and at the same time HMG have pressed ahead with the preparations for a conference between 25th-27th September which will discuss the future constitutional arrangements for the Province. At this conference the political parties in Northern Ireland represented at Stormont will have the opportunity to express their considered views on the future of Northern Ireland. HMG is encouraged by the preparation, and publication, of

8 September 1972 
We have made further enquiries of Ministry of Home Affairs as a result of your letter of 22 August about the attempted break-out from Long Kesh. The Governor has confirmed that full inspections are being carried out at six or seven day intervals; it is more effective if the intervals are not too regular. A copy of this letter is being sent to Custis at the Ministry of Defence.

There was a general discussion of the latest activities of the UDA following 3-4,000 shipyard

Maria McGuire’s defection. 
It was felt that the maximum propaganda value had been extracted from It was important to avoid giving the impression 
that, as had already been claimed by the IRA, the whole exercise was engineered by British Security. FUTURE IRA TACTICS 4. 
There could either be a cease-fire or an intensification of the campaign 
in the time before the conference, but owing to the lack of a coherent organisation or body of opinion within the IRA, prophesy was difficult. 
A ceasefire, however, 
would be unlikely to have any effect on current arrest policy. NEXT MEETINGS 5.

Northern Ireland (GEN 79) 
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has circulated three memoranda - GEN 79(72) 18, on the political and constitutional future of 
Northern Ireland; GEN 79(72) 19, on a package of security measures and changes in the administration of justice; and GEN 79(72) 17, covering a report by officials on the legal aspects of possible measures to deal with terrorist organisations. 2. 
These three subjects are interlinked in that the suppression of 
terrorism is an indispensable ingredient of any political settlement for the Province. 
Nevertheless, you may think it convenient to take 
GEN 79(72) 18 first (since its subject matter is both more fundamental and less likely to raise immediate practical problems) and then to consider the two memoranda about our policy towards terrorist organisations. The Future of Northern Ireland 3. 
In GEN 79(72) 18, the Secretary of State proposes that, in view 
of the absence of any consensus among the Ulster interests themselves and the certainty that they would unite to oppose any solution which we put forward, we should let them have their say at the conference on 25th-27th September and should then produce a Green Paper setting out, for general consideration, the ideas which we consider right but can perhaps link, presentationally, with points emerging from the conference. 4. 
The Secretary of State also reverts to the projected plebiscite on 
the Border but admits that, in terms of legislative priority, it must take second place to his proposed legislation to establish special courts. 5. 
Finally, he indicates in Annex 1 the main elements of the 
constitutional settlement which he envisages at the end of direct rulei.e. the permanent abolition of Stormont, coupled with enlarged Northern Ireland representation in the Westminster Parliament, a "regional assembly" in Belfast and the transfer of the law and order function to the United Kingdom Government. He promises further memoranda elaborating these suggestions. 6. 
All of this seems sensible, particularly if publication of a Green Paper were linked with the implication in paragraph 3 of Annex 1 that

NOTE OF A MEETING IN LONDON AT 3 0’CLOCK ON 7 SEPTEMBER Those present were: 
Secretary of State Dr O’Sullivan Mr Stevens 
The Secretary of State explained that the reason for recent UDA and Tartan Gang activity was the arrest by security forces of a leading UDA member - Mr Doyle. He said that he thought terrorist activity generally seemed to be decreasing but he was most upset by the explosion this morning at Mr O’Kane’s house. The Secretary of State added that he had on Tuesday visited local security committees in Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh and that on Wednesday he had attended a lunch in Ballymoney. At all these country areas he had been pleased to note a relaxed atmosphere, although obviously in Border areas terrorist activity was still giving great cause for concern. 
The Secretary of State asked Dr O’Sullivan if he would report to Mr Lynch that HMG had no wish to remain in any Roman Catholic schools 
a 
or Casement Park. However, because of the security situation in certain areas it was necessary for the Army to maintain a presence but they were actively seeking alternative accommodation and in fact would be out of St Genevieve’s, all being well, in October. 
Dr O’Sullivan said that the reason Mr Lynch had asked him to call was because he was disturbed by the press briefing put out by HMG after his meeting with the Prime Minister. He explained that the briefing, or at least reports appearing in the newspapers, laid particular emphasis on the fact that the Prime Minister gave Mr Lynch a severe talking to about the Irish Government’s handling of the IRA. This had embarrassed Mr Lynch, especially since it was understood by his Ministry of Foreign Affairs that HMG would not use IRA activity south of the Border for propaganda purposes. 
The Secretary of State said that there had been 28 cross-Border raids by the IRA in the last month and this was obviously causing concern in the North and, no doubt, to Mr Lynch. He appreciated that there was some co-operation between Southern Irish security forces and the

5 SEPTEMBER Operations and Intelligence 
The situation continues to remain quiet, although the night of 2/3 September saw the most shooting in belfast since Operation Motorman. There has been a drop in the number of explosions throughout the Province. 
2. The UDA appears restless and unsettled; this may be a sign of some disintegration within the movement with less control exercised from the centre. 
3. As far as the defection of Maria McGuire is concerned, no firm conclusions can yet be drawn whether a power struggle is developing within the Provisionals. 
Gen 79 
4. The next meeting of Gen 79 will be on 11 September. The S.of S.for Northern Ireland intends to put papers before this meeting on future security policy and long-term political strategy. Proposals will be included on the review of the Special Powers Act. 
5. The meeting agreed that they should soon give some consideration to the type of action that the Provisional IRA and the Ulster Defence Association might pursue before the conference.

is reportedly wanted by Interpol in connection with the attempt to fly Czech arms through Amsterdam on 16 Oct 1971. The main points she made were that there is a power struggle within the Provisional leadership, who are under pressure to call off the bombing compaign that 
real power resides in the hands of 
Stephenson ( a bigoted murderer) in Dublin, and Twomey in Belfast, where the dynamic for the whole campaign exists; that anger among Northern Catholics in general has been growing because of the political sterility of a purely terrorist policy; and that the IRA must call a cease fire and talk, while HMG must realise that the IRA must have a place at some ultimate conference table. In the Republic, tho Provisionals issued a statement dismissing the allegations made in England by Maria McGuire, claiming that she was of no consequence in the organisation and knew little of significance. 
Elsewhere, Mr Heath meets Mr Lynch today 4 Sep in Munich at the Olympic Games. 2. During FRI/SAT 1/2 SEP 72 the Province was quiet. There were 17 shooting 
incidents of which 14 involved the Security Forces. A Corporal in 40 Cdo was wounded in the leg by gunfire. There was one explosion, and ATO detonated 3 devices. There was a spate of arson in Portadown, thought to be an attempt by Protestants to set up an intersectarian clash. 
3. During SAT/SUN 2/3 SEP 72 there was a marked increase in shooting and in 
Belfast the level was the highest since Motorman. However there were no explosions, although there was a spate of incendiary attacks against Protestant owned shops in Ballymena. In an incident in Belfast 2 patrols mistook each other for gunmen and exchanged fire; one soldier was killed and two wounded. Elsewhere two soldiers, and an RUC constable were wounded one of whom was on leave. Four civilians were wounded and 4 hits were claimed. 
4. During SUN/MON 3/4 SEP 72 there were fewer incidents than the day before.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is 
preparing a paper on the ending of internment and on legislation for Special Courts. He wants to have a Cabinet decision on this to enable him, if Ministers so decide, to make an announcement before the Northern Ireland Conference to be held at the end of this month. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland discussed, without reaching a conclusion, the possibility of a meeting on this paper on Monday 11 September. The feasibility of this will largely depend on whether the paper is ready in time. It does not seem essential for it to be discussed before the Prime Minister meets the S.D.L.P. on 12 September: but Mr. Whitelaw would prefer this if it proves possible.
