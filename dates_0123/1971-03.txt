NOTE FOR THE RECORD Monsieur Maurice Schumann, Foreign Minister 
of the French Republic, who was accompanied by Monsieur Geoffroy de Courcel, the French Ambassador, came to see the Prime Minister, who was accompanied by the British Ambassador to France, at 10 Downing Street on Friday l2 November 1971 at 12 noon. Monsieur Schumann congratulated the Prime 
Minister on the result of the Parliamentary vote on the decision of principle to join the European Communities on the basis of the arrangements which had been negotiated. 
The Prime Minister said that the 
result had been a gratifyingly good one, and that it had made a considerable difference since that time. The vote had been accepted as decisive, and this would undoubtedly help when the time came for dealing with the consequential legislation. It meant that the Opposition in Parliament were now concentrating their fire on other subjects, notably on the question of Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland Monsieur Schumann said that, when he was in 
Dublin, his impression had been that Mr. Lynch and Dr. Hillery were both anxious to find a basis for an agreement with the British Government. The Prime Minister agreed that this was so; Mr. Lynch’s two visits to Chequers had made this clear. But they could not see how to get on top of the gunmen in Northern Ireland. 
The Dublin Government was in an embarrassing position: on the one hand, it was

DRAFT SUBMISSION - INTERNMENT CAMP Reference: 1. D/DS 6/7/153/44/17 dated 24 Mar 71 We would like to treat the possible establishment 
of an Internment Camp and an Interrogation Centre as two seperate, although related, issues. 
For this reason I recommend the following amendments to your draft submission: 
a. Delete last 4 lines of para 7 starting with word "Arrangements" 
b. Insert new para 8, which should read: "Arrangements for an Interrogation Centre are being examined seperately. We do not consider that it should form any part of the Internment Camp complex, but be located elsewhere.. Present suggestions are that the Interrogation Centre could be set up in a suitable modified existing building of brick construction". 
2. For your information the RUCSB is in fact now pressing 
ahead with the establishment of an Interrogation Centre.’ We are advising them on the control and conduct of the operation of such a Centre and may also have to provide some of the supporting specialist staff and, in conjunction with the Security Service, the technical aids. Actual interrogation will be conducted by RUCSB personnel, in aid of this we will be running a course for the RUC at the Intelligence Centre during the period 16

NORTHERN IRELAND INTERNMENT CAMP - DRAFT SUBMISSION 1. When BGS Headquarters Northern Ireland visited me yesterday I asked 
him how far discussions with the RUC on internment have gone. He replied that the only contact had been with the Special Branch, primarily to ensure that their list of potential internees is up to date, which it is not; and to discuss the interrogation centre. 
2. I attach at Annex A a few comments on your draft submission which 
I think covers a complex subject very comprehensively. I do however feel that the case for a rapid ministerial decision to allow the constructions work to start soonest would be strengthened by reference to the inevitable world-wide interest in the living conditions, and circumstances to be afforded to internees, which would not perhaps be as good as they should be until the proposed Longkesh camp is built. 
3. I think you could also justify the immediate preparation of a 
long term site by emphasising the unsuitability of any of the short term solutions, of which the Maidstone is the most acceptable. 
4. Attached at Annex B to this minute are my comments on Annex A of your draft submission. 26 Mar 71

NORTHERN IRELAND Further to my note of 19 March (not to all or necessary), 
Mr Matthews and Captain Cook have returned from their visit to Belfast where they considered MAIDSTONE’s suitability as an internment ship pending the construction of more permanent arrangements ashore in Northern Ireland. A copy of their report is attached. You will see that this reinforces the view which we have already given to the Army Department that the MAIDSTONE is not really suitable for this purpose. However, if it proves necessary to provide secure accommodation without arousing suspicion that internment regulations are about to be brought into force, then MAIDSTONE could be used, at 48 hours notice, to provide reasonable accommodation for up to 150 internees with the requisite guards. The naval personnel aboard her would continue to provide hotel services but would have to shift their presently held accommodation. The advice is that provided the number of internees does not exceed this level, and proper arrangements are made to keep them under surveillance, then they should not be able maliciously to damage the ship to any serious extent; nor should they be able, by their own folly, to put at risk other internees. 
2. As soon as the intention to intern had been announced it would 
be possible to bring workmen in - probably from Harland and Wolff to protect vulnerable services in the fore part of the ship so that, within about two weeks, it would be possible to move the internees to a more secure area and increase their numbers up to about 300. This should provide adequate accommodation for the matter of weeks which it would take to provide accommodation ashore. The Army authorities in Northern Ireland who were associated with the examination are satisfied that they could arrange for exercises, visiting, interrogation and medical services on an ad hoc basis for the comparatively short period while the MAIDSTONE would be used for this purpose. They and the naval divers already provide a high standard of protection against external attack.

MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON NORTHERN IRELAND INTERNMENT 
Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Secretary of State for Defence Regulation 12 made under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Acts 
(Northern Ireland) 1922-43 confers on the Northern Ireland Government the power to intern without trial. The power to intern is much criticised and is inconsistent with the European human Rights Convention but in the course of the I.R.A. activities of 1956-62 a notice of derogation was in 1957 lodged in Strasbourg. 2. 
Internmnt has been used in the past against I.R.A. activity both 
North and South of the Border. In response to recent demanded for internment the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland has said that if the security advisersthe G.O.C. and the Chief Constable of the R.U.C. 
should be used he would not hesitate to act. But the Northern Ireland Goverment have a firm commitment to consult H.M.G. before making a final decision. 3. 
- recommend that these powers The Government of the Irish Republic have announced their readiness 
to reactivate power of internment against conspiracies to kidnap prominent persons and the Government of the Republic recently lodged a notice of derogation with the European Commission. 4. 
At present the demand for Internment is not vociferous, but continuing 
interest may easily produce a climate in which the northern Ireland Government feels compelled to press us to agree to it. The considerations against internment are:(a) it would be politically damaging internally and internationally; (b) there is no certainty that all dangerous men could be identified;

At 3.50 p.m. on the afternoon of 10th March three 
Fusiliers of 1st Battalion The Royal Highland Fusiliers stationed in GIRDWOOD PARK BELFAST were seen drinking in a public house in ANN STREET in the centre of the city, by two corporals from the same Company. The three Fusiliers, two brothers JOHN McCAIG and JOSEPH McCAIG and a third, Fusilier DOUGALD McCAUGHY, were in the company of five civilians. All the soldiers were officially off duty on a rest day. 
At between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. an hysterical phone 
call was received by the ambulance service, reporting an accident in the LIGONIEL area of NORTH WEST BELFAST. The call was answered but nothing was found. This may or may not have any connexion with what occurred later. 
At approximately 8 p.m. the police received an 
annonymous 999 call to say that there were three bodies in a ditch beside a lane in the SQUIRES HILL area of NORTH WEST BELFAST. The police recovered the bodies who were later identified by the murdered soldiers’ Company Commander. All three had been shot in the head. 
A good description of one of the five civilians was 
obtained and Special Branch investigations began immediately and continue. The next of kin of the three soldiers were informed by 1 a.m. 11th March. 
Press enquiries began at 9.50 p.m. and the item was 
included in news broadcasts from 10 p.m. onwards. A simple press release was issued concurrently by Public Relations staffs in HQ Northern Ireland, and in London at 10.30 p.m. confirming that three soldiers had been found murdered and that next of kin were being informed. 
A further release was issued at 1.30 a.m. giving the names of the soldiers concerned.

Ref. A09466 PRIME MINISTER 
Northern Ireland The discussion this afternoon might most conveniently be organised 
under three main heads:A. 
1. Politically - 
How long can we hope that the present situation will last? i.e. How long is Major Chichester-Clark likely to be 
able to resist the rising pressure from both the IRA and the extreme Unionists ? The meeting of the Unionist Council to consider a vote of no confidence in Major Chichester-Clark’s Government, having been postponed because of the postal strike, now seems likely to take place at the end of this month. If it goes badly from our point of view, we may then be faced with a decision whether we are prepared to allow Craig and his associates to assume power. What should we do in those circumstances? 2. 
Militarily - i.e. Even if the present political situation persists 
indefinitely, can we safely assume that the Army will be physically able to contain the IRA/Unionist intimidation? Or will further reinforcements be required? And if so, shall we be able to supply them? (This assumes that the Army will continue to carry the brunt of dealing with the situation and that there will be no question of re-arming the RUC or reviving any body like the ’B’ Specials). 
B. 1. If there is a political collapse within the next few weeks, are we prepared to deal with it? Politically - i.e. Are our contingency plans for the introduction of 
direct rule in a state in which they could, if necessary, be implemented at very short notice? This means a Bill, various Orders under the Bill, the provision of personnel for key appointments, etc., etc. 
a decision on the position of the Governor - i.e. would he be our chosen 
instrument in a crisis; or should we wish to appoint a Minister of the United Kingdom Government to run the Province from Stormont? 2. 
Militarily It also means - i.e. Are the Chiefs of Staff (who have recently reviewed 
their own contingency plans) satisfied that in the "worst case" the Army could be sufficiently reinforced to cope? (Linked with this is the question of our intelligence arrangements in a "worst case", on which the JIC are conducting a fresh enquiry and I am trying to arrange for Sir Dick White, who returns from the Far East today, to visit Ulster in the very near future).

REPORT ON NORTHERN IRELAND 
FOR PERIOD FROM 9 a.m. 5th MARCH TO 8 a.m. 8th MARCH 1971 It was a violent week-end in Belfast but with the degree 
of violence diminishing as the week-end progressed. The remainder of the Province was relatively quiet. 
The genesis of the trouble seems to have been the 
kidnapping of three Protestants by the IRA early in the morning of 5th March. These Protestants were members of a group with whom the Goulding wing of the IRA had deposited a cache of arms for safekeeping. Because of 
shortness of funds they 
had begun to sell the deposited weapons and ammunition for their own profit. The IRA learned of this and were holding two of the kidnapped men as hostages while the third was released to inform his friends that the other two would be killed if the complete arms cache was not returned to the IRA. 
In an attempt to find the hostages the security forces searched a bar in the Falls area at 1.30 p.m. 
This resulted 
in some rioting. Subsequently the hostages were released from another part of Belfast and the arms cache, amounting to nearly 6,000 rounds of ammunition, was uncovered by the security forces in a house in a non-sectarian Northern suburb of the city. 
Sporadic rioting continued in the Falls throughout the 
afternoon and, with less intensity, into the evening. Vehicles were hijacked and used as barricades; and petrol and nail bombs were thrown. These became particularly serious around midnight and, after a warning was given, soldiers of 3 PARA opened fire. Two men were hit, one of whom later died. 
During the same evening and night there was also trouble 
in the Ballymurphy, Ardoyne and New Lodge Road areas involving occasional petrol bomb and firearm attacks on the security forces. 
During this period of 24 hours it is estimated that over 
200 bombs of various sorts were thrown at the security forces and 40 rounds fired. The security forces suffered six minor casualties; killed one assailant and wounded three, possibly four, others; and effected 28 arrests.

PRIME MINISTER 
Co-operation Between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland 
I asked the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to 
consider the proposals for economic co-operation made in Mr. Lynch’s speech of 20 February (See Dublin Telegram Number 58 attached). 
In the minute below, 
the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary concludes that no major initiatives are necessary as there are already many existing examples of practical co-operation between North and South but he suggests that there should be "one or two additional developments and some window-dressing." 
He mentions a number of leas in 
which co-operation may be possible (anti-pollution, road planning, Arts Councils, meteorology, agricultural research stations, tourism and energy supply). 
He 
suggests that these possibilities might be explored by the Home Secretary when he visits Belfast to-day and tomorrow. 
The Home Secretary took this minute 
with him on the plane this morning but we do not know whether he will feel that the time is ripe to broach these ideas with Major Chichester-Clark.

PRIME MINISTER PM/71/28 THE IRISH REPUBLIC: RELATIONS WITH NORTHERN IRELAND In his letter of 23 February your Private Secretary asked 
for comments on Mr. Lynch’s proposals for North-South economic co-operation. I delayed sending these until I had met Dr. Hillery. 2. 
I had a relaxed and friendly meeting with Dr. Hillery on 
25 February. It took place after Mr. Lynch’s speech but before either of us had studied fully Major Chichester-Clark’s reply of 24 February, and before the recent tragic deaths of Lance Corporal Jolliffe and the two RUC men and the consequent rise in tension. 3. 
I found Dr. Hillery still concerned about the relationship 
of the two communities in the North, and very anxious that the minority should "participate" at all possible levels of society. Major Chichester-Clark’s speech of 24 February ("There shall be no second-class citizenship for anyone in Northern Ireland") had given some reassurance. I know the Home Secretary recognises the need for frequent reassurance and I mention it no further. 4. 
Dr. Hillery was more concerned for the credibility of 
Mr. Lynch’s policy - novel in terms of Anglo-Irish relations of mutual trust: if this failed it would be disastrous. As he put it, the peaceful policy was "established and any solution must be in friendship. But the policy has to show movement". Here he was asking that there be some sign from Major Chichester-Clark that he found acceptable Mr. Lynch’s hopes of cross-Border co-operation in practical matters of common local concern.

MO 19/3 PRIME MINISTER NORTHERN IRELAND I agree with the view expressed by the Home 
Secretary, in his minute of 26th February, that it would be very useful to have a fresh assessment, by an expert, of the overall organisation of, and arrangements for co-ordinating, our intelligence and counter-subversion activities in Northern Ireland. 
2. As I mentioned to you in my recent minute about 
our strategy for countering the IRA, I regard reliable intelligence as a key factor in the effective deployment of our forces on the ground; and, while I have no doubt that a great deal has been done to improve the standard since 1969, there is clearly room for further improvement. It is of course absolutely vital for the various intelligence and security organisations 
- military and civilian alike 
to work closely together; and a fresh eye might be able to spot one or two gaps in the present arrangements. 
3. I support the proposal that Sir Dick White should 
be asked to take on this assignment. He will have the full co-operation of the Defence Intelligence Staff and of the Army in Northern Ireland. 
4. I am sending copies of this minute to the 
Home Secretary and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.

THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WOULD REGARD MAJOR CHICHESTER-CLARK’S RESIGNATION AND THE REPLACEMENT OF HIS GOVERNMENT BY EXTREMIST UNIONISTS AS A MAJOR DISASTER BOTH FOR THE NORTH AND FOR THEIR OWN POLICIES. THEY WOULD REGARD DIRECT RULE FROM WESTMINSTER AS ONLY A SLIGHTLY LESSER DISASTER BECAUSE IT WOULD DEROGATE FROM THEIR POLICY OF SOLVING PARTITION THROUGH IRISH TALKING TO IRISH AND BECAUSE IT CLEARLY MIGHT LEAD TO COMMUNAL STRIFE. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU THINK THERE IS ANY ACTION I CAN TAKE WITH THEM WHICH WOULD HELP OUT CHICHESTER-CLARK. FOR INSTANCE WOULD IT HELP HIS POSITION IF THE TAOISEACH WERE TO ISSUE A MORE EXPLICIT STATEMENT OF CONDEMNATION OF THE IRA VIOLENCE, OR IF THE IRISH WERE TO TAKE MEASURES AGAINST THE IRA IN THE SOUTH? THERE CAN OF COURSE BE NO GUARANTEE THAT HE WOULD DO EITHER. 
2. IF CHICHESTER CLARK’S SITUATION IS SO DESPERATE, WE NEED TO TELL 
THE WHOLE STORY TO LYNCH, WHOSE ROLE COULD BE VERY HELPFUL. THIS IN EFFECT MEANS AUTHORISING ME AT ONCE TO DISCUSS POSITION FRANKLY WITH HIM ON BASIS OF BELFAST TEL UNDER REFERENCE.

PRIME MINISTER Visit ofMr. Faulkner You may find it convenient to have tomorrow the attached copies of:- 
(a) A list of the main topics for discussion, as they emerged from the meeting of the Northern Ireland Committee this morning. 
(b) A list of the topics which, we have just been informed, Mr. Faulkner may wish to raise. 
(c) A first shot at the outline of a communique, together with a draft communique which we have just learned that the Ulster team will be bringing with them. 
As regards (b), most of the items are already being discussed at the official level between the two Governments; and it should suffice - apart - simply to undertake that, when they are submitted for decision, 
from item 5 
United Kingdom Ministers will consider them carefully. The Home Secretary may be able to dispose of a good many of them at his meeting in the afternoon; but we will let you have, before your own meeting, a brief note on the current state of play at the official level on the most important of them. Item 5 - the proposal that a member of the Royal Family might open the Ulster Parliament on its 50th Anniversary this year - 
raises delicate issues, 
in more senses than one! You will presumably wish merely to take delivery of the suggestion and to undertake to have it considered. 
It should not be 
allowed to become public knowledge meanwhile. As regards (c) we may have to adopt parts of the Ulster draft of the 
communique; and in any event our own version may have to be expanded, as I have indicated in square brackets, in order to accommodate references to specific subjects which have featured in the discussions. But I hope that, however much or however little we have to add, we shall stick to the basic structure of our own draft.

MR FAULKNER’S STATEMENT ON TAKING OFFICE Tuesday 23 March 
throughout the entire community. Without that, all else would be futile. Obviously the kernel of our immediate problems is the law and order situation. 
My most important single aim is to restore confidence I am convinced that what we need on this front are not new 
principles but practical results on the ground in the elimination not only of terrorism and sabotage but of riots and disorders. The basic principle must clearly be that the rule of law shall operate in all parts of Northern Ireland, so that the security which goes with the rule of law can be enjoyed by all our citizens. 
It is the responsibility of the Army and the police to put 
that principle into effect. My Administration will give them every support. I will not expect harsh measures or repressive measures. No law-abiding citizen will have anything whatsoever to fear from my Administration. 
I will be looking for efficient measures. When the governments 
at Westminster aid Stormont take decisions on these matters we will certainly insist not only on effective action by the security forces but, and this is equally important, swift and decisive reaction to any trouble which might occur. 
I shall be looking urgently at ways and means of improving the 
present security arrangements, particularly the coordination of Army and police efforts. As to the police, I will certainly not allow the R.U.C. to be used as a political shuttlecock. 
The men have had to endure far too much over the past two years 
or so, with perhaps not enough thanks from the community. I am convince. that their normal role as a civilian police force is the right one, while at the same time it is obvious that whenever they are engaged on dangerous work they must be given the necessary protection. 
As for the part played by the Army, anti-government 
propagandist tend to imply that what the Government or the Unionistminded population are calling for are punitive jackboot tactics. Nothing could be farther from the truth. What I believe the entire law-abiding population of Northern Ireland is looking to the Government to ensure, and what I shall be aiming at, is that lawbreakers and criminals be brought to book and dealt with in the due process of the law receiving punishment appropriate to their cries.

29 March, 1971 You will have seen telegrams Nos. 105, 106 and 
107 from Dublin. For ease of reference I attach copies. No. 106 in particular refers to Mr. Lynch’s useful public statements on developments in the North, which he clearly made as helpful as possible in response to the Prime Minister’s message. We are studying what further steps can be taken to get practical measures carried out by the Irish authorities. 
The U.K. Representative in Belfast, Mr. Burroughs, 
has asked that he be authorised to inform Mr. Faulkner of the Irish communications. You will recall that the message of 17 March from the Prime Minister to Mr. Lynch was known to Major Chichester-Clark; and it has throughout been our practice to keep Stormont informed in broad terms of exchanges between Westminster and Dublin. I should be grateful for your agreement.

(b) The border; how to make it much more difficult to get across undetected; road blocks, barbed wire, manning of customs posts.

NORTHERN IRELAND MINISTERIAL DISPOSITIONS IN THE EVENT OF DIRECT RULE 1. It has in effect been decided that, if the United Kingdom Government 
assumes direct responsibility for Northern Ireland, executive responsibility should rest with a Minister, not with the Governor. Any new arrangements should so far as possible reconcile the following factors:the need to have an allocation of Ministerial responsibility which is politically acceptable at Westminster; the need to ensure that HMG is able to use to the full the Northern Ireland civil service as an instrument of government; the desirability of avoiding arrangements which have, at the outset, too great an appearance of permanence or of being HMG’s long-term solution. 
2. be:- 
(a) a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; or (b) the Home Secretary, supported by another Minister in the Cabinet on the Foreign Office and (on occasion) the Treasury pattern. 
In either event, there would be a good deal of Parliamentary business (e.g. Orders in Council legislating for Northern Ireland) which would have to be handled by a junior Minister - in the separate Northern Ireland Department, or in the Home Office, as the case might be. 
The two possible arrangements for Ministerial responsibility seem to

PRIME MINISTER Intelligence in Northern Ireland You will already have seen Sir Dick White’s report following his visit to Northern Ireland. I think we are all indebted to him

already in hand - and are, for example, urgently considering the additional appointments which he proposed.

25 March, 1971. Northern Ireland You will have seen Dublin telegrams Nos. 101 and 
102 of 23 and 24 March respectively, about Mr. Lynch’s recent helpful statement on Mr. Faulkner’s accession. 
In the latter of these two telegrams H.M. 
Ambassador recommended a private message of appreciation. We recognise there could be problems if we slipped into a too frequent high level dialogue with the Irish, and it is suggested therefore that the requirement could best be met by a general expression of appreciation, passed on by the Ambassador, and quoting the "highest levels". I enclose a draft telegram and would be grateful for your approval.

Thank you for your letter of 16 March about I have certainly not overlooked 
your earlier letter of 24 December, and the points which you made are ones which I have had vry much 
in mind in discussions with the Government of Northern Ireland over recent weeks. I should like to say again - as I did in the House an Monday - that I fully understand your 
deeply felt concern about the present situation. I know of the hard work which you and others have done to sustain the moderate and reforming policy in Northern Ireland and the courage which you have shown.

There is one suggestion which may still be worth The greatest 
problem which any administration faces there is the lack of understanding of the division of powers between the two Governments. 
This, as you know, has tended to 
lay the blame for failures in the security field almost entirely at the feet of the Stormont administration. (I am speaking of the feelings of the people in Ulster.) 
Why not make another attempt to explain where 
responsibility really lies by sending, say, the Minister of State for Defence to take up residence for a week a fortnight or longer as required, in the Province where he would appear to be actually directing matters? 
I can see certain dangers in this and I have not 
discussed it with the Northern Ireland Government, so if you think it worthwhile passing on to the Prime Minister perhaps you would do so in confidence.

The Rt. Hon. Harold Wilson, M.P., Leader of the 
Opposition, came to see the Prime Minister at Chequers on Sunday, 21 March, 1971, at 11.00 a.m. to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister said that Major Chichester-Clark’s 
morale had seemed reasonably high when he visited Chequers five weeks earlier. At that stage he had not been pressing for further action by the Army, beyond an operation to pick up seven members of the I.R.A. who appeared in para-military uniform at the funeral of an I.R.A. man. This operation had been conducted and two of those concerned had been apprehended and convicted. When the Home Secretary went to Northern Ireland on 
5 March, he noticed a deterioration in Major ChichesterClark’s confidence. 
It was clear that the murder of the 
three British soldiers had made a great impact on him. He said himself that it had brought home to the general public the danger under which they all lay. His nerve had probably also been shaken by the subsequent marches, which might have been organised by the Reverend Ian Paisley. Major Chichester-Clark had not proposed internment; indeed he had made it clear that he was opposed to it, though his Right Wing wanted it. There were two substantial objections; the difficulties of finding a place to detain

I have decided to resign because I see no other 
way of bringing home to all concerned the realities of the present constitutional, political and security situation. On Thursday, I indicated to Parliament the results 
of my discussion earlier in the week with British Ministers. I welcomed then, as I do now, the response of the U.K. Government particularly in the matter of troop reinforcements. The situation, however, is simply this: it is 
apparent that public and Parliamentary opinion in Northern Ireland looks to the Northern Ireland Government for measures which can bring the current I.R.A. campaign swiftly to an end. 
I have expressed to 
British Ministers the full force of this opinion and have pressed upon them my view that some further initiative is required. 
While they have agreed to 
take any feasible step open to them to intensify the efforts against the I.R.A., it remains the professional military view - 
and one which indeed I have often 
expressed myself - that it would be misleading to the Northern Ireland community to suggest that we are faced with anything but a long haul, and that such initiatives that can be taken are unlikely to effect a radical improvement in the situation in the short

Northern Ireland I attach separate briefs on the four items for tomorrow’s meeting. 
I think that they carry matters as far as they can be carried on the basis of the four memoranda before Ministers. But both the memoranda and the briefs were, of course, drafted before your discussion with Major Chichester-Clark this afternoon; and you will wish to discuss with your colleagues how far, in the light of that discussion, the proposals in the memoranda constitute action which will be both timely and adequate if things go badly wrong. On this last point I would only add that Harold Black told me, in a private conversation, that:(a) 
He, himself, although an optimist by temperament and sceptical about crises (of which he has now surmounted a good many), was doubtful whether, this time, Major Chichester-Clark would pull it off. He thought that there was a real risk that the Prime Minister might fall either as a result of the Unionist Council meeting on the 29th or as a result of a meeting of his own constituency arty a day or two before the Council. 
(b) 
He regarded Faulkner as the most probable successor to Major Chichester-Clark. But he did not see how Faulkner, given his public comments on Craig, could possibly have Craig in any Government which he might succeed informing. He preferred not to speculate what might happen thereafter. 
(c) 
He had noted that Paisley had recently been more moderate and statesman-like in his utterances. 
But he did not believe that this leopard had really changed its spots. (d) 
His own people - i.e. the staffs of the Government Departments at Stormont - were in good heart and good shape; and they could probably be relied on to cope with whatever might lie ahead.

Northern Ireland Possibility of Assistance from the Irish Republic 
Paragraph 3 of this paper confirms that Mr. Lynch would go to 
some lengths to avoid either a Craig regime or direct rule in Northern Ireland. 
All the measures listed in paragraph 5 of the paper would be 
useful; but the more helpful measures (d and b) are the less likely ones! 2. 
If we think that Mr. Lynch really wants to help, the time to 
approach him secretly would seem to be now. It is no secret that the Ulster Unionist Council is to meet on 29th March and that Major Chichester-Clark’s position will then be threatened. 
not now ripe for an approach, on the lines that:(a) 
(b) 
For both Dublin and London the fall of the Chichester-Clark Administration would be unwelcome. 
Major Chichester-Clark’s political position is gravely weakened by the immunity which the IRA enjoy in Eire and by the apparent freedom of its leadership both to use the country as a safe haven and to publicise in Dublin its hostile activities in Northern Ireland in a way which is not normally compatible with friendly relations between sovereign governments. 
(c) 
It is to the interest of us both, therefore, to make life as difficult as possible for the IRA in Northern Ireland. 
This approach could lead to suggestions on the lines of paragraph 5 of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary’s paper, for implementation before, rather than after, Major Chichester-Clark falls, coupled perhaps with proposals for a more effective (and perhaps co-ordinated) patrolling of the border by both countries, on lines touched on by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary during yesterday’s discussion in the Northern Ireland Committee. 
Is the time 16th March, 1971

against internment. 
Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the paper set out the arguments for and It appears that there are about 400 names on the list 
of potential internees, including not only IRA men but also extreme Protestants. But the Security Forces are not sanguine of being able to take more than 15 to 20 per cent of this total. 
It is conceivable that 
even to apprehend so small a percentage would nevertheless have some deterrent effect upon the remainder. But one cannot help thinking that it would not and that the reprisal effect would be more marked. 2. 
Government of the Irish Republic to reactivate internment powers (paragraph 3), it is thought to be too much to hope that he would be prepared to do so specifically to match an effort on our part (see paragraph 5 of NI(71) 2). 3. 
Although Mr. Lynch sometime ago announced the readiness of the We have been told that Major Chichester-Clark is not pressing 
for these powers and would not do so unless the Security Forces advised him to do so. But what if political pressure causes him to change his mind? The Committee will need not only to consider the weight of the arguments in paragraphs 5 and 6 on their own merits but also to be ready to consider them in the possible context of strong pressure on us to save Major Chichester-Clark’s Government by agreeing to internment. 
In 
other words is internment, with all its disadvantages, preferable to direct rule ?

Ministerial Committee on Northern Ireland Contingency Planning for Direct Rule (NI(71) 3) 
The first important issue is whether the Bill should provide for 
executive power to be exercised by the Governor of Northern Ireland or by a United Kingdom Minister. Whichever is decided, the broad structure in Northern Ireland will be the same: the suspension of the Northern Ireland Parliament and the Minister or Governor governing through the existing machinery of the Northern Ireland Departments. The Bill would have to be enacted at great speed; and at this stage simplicity and the retention of the present administrative machinery is a paramount necessity. 2. 
The advantages of the Governor are that he is an apolitical figure 
and that the authority of a Minister would in a sense be more limited. 3. 
The advantages of the Minister are that, although his authority 
would be more limited, it would be ampler than that of the Governor and that administration through the Governor may be thought to have a certain lack of plausibility. But, if a Minister is decided upon, his powers and responsibilities will have to be worked out carefully, bearing in mind that London will be the seat of power. 4. 
into effect. 
The plans, rightly, do not deal with the occasion for putting them There has been some discussion on whether the election of 
Craig to leadership should of itself be the signal for the execution of the plan or whether that should await some experience of his policies. 
The 
decision may have to await events. But it might help Ministers if the Home Secretary were asked for a paper on the implications of the choice, particularly bearing in mind that Craig might try to force the issue by having a General Election. 5. 
Minister (or Governor) will need a staff in Belfast. 
Considerable civil staff reinforcements will be needed. The (It is contemplated 
that it should be under the United Kingdom Representative and should work with the staff of the Northern Ireland Cabinet Office). The Home Office Department dealing with Northern Ireland will need greatly to be expanded; the Civil Service Department have this in hand, and no doubt the Home Secretary can count on your strong support. There may be a need to send a few senior officers to Belfast to replace Northern Ireland heads of Departments of whose services a conflict of loyalties might deprive us. (But we hope not).

HOME SECRETARY NORTHERN IRELAND - ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT At yesterday’s meeting of the Ministerial Committee I 
undertook to give you my initial views on the idea of establishing a full time battalion in the Ulster Defence Regiment. This proposal has been under discussion between Ministry of Defence and HQ Northern Ireland and we received only yesterday a revised paper on this subject. This is being examined urgently (the Home Office will be brought in) but inevitably I can today only give you a general outline of the proposal and some preliminary reactions to it. 
2. Basically the idea is that some 650 members of the UDR 
would be recruited on a full time basis in a battalion most of which would be located at Lisburn but with one company in the west, probably at Omagh. It would, like the part-time units, be engaged on border and guard duties in the rural areas with the object of releasing regular soldiers. In terms of our force levels in Northern Ireland, the argument in favour of the proposal is that it might enable us to manage with one less regular battalion. 
3. A full-time UDR battalion would, however, constitute a 
new departure for the force. There are already, admittedly, locally recruited members of the UDR who are engaged on a full time basis but these are the permanent staff who undertake what might best be termed housekeeping and administrative duties necessary for the running of the Regiment. The new battalion, however, would be recruited as a full-time operational wing and, as such, it might be held to be a departure from the concept of the part-time volunteer force outlined in the November 1969 White Paper. Legally, I am advised, there would be no difficulty in employing the people in this way provided we called them out for full time service under the terms of Section 2(2) of the Act. But I think we should have to give Parliament a clear statement of our intentions, since we should be making a definite change in the character of the force. 
4. The main issue is whether the costs and benefits of the 
proposal make it worthwhile to proceed in this way. As regards benefits, I have already mentioned one - the relief of our

Northern Ireland Contingency Planning (NI(71) 1) 
The Official Committee examined this paper at their meeting on 
15th March (attended by General Tuzo) and were broadly satisfied with it. Two further steps, however, were taken following that meeting. Arrangements are now being made to earmark individuals to reinforce the intelligence organisation when required; and a Ministry of Defence team is being despatched to examine the accommodation possibilities if a policy of internment is adopted. 2. 
It might be best to confine discussion to the purely military aspects 
and to discuss such matters as legal problems (Items 3 and 4 of the Annex) under the Civil Contingency Planning item on the agenda. 
Military points 
which Ministers may like to discuss on the Ministry of Defence conclusions are:(a) The timeliness and adequacy of the proposed reinforcement (Item 13). 
Is 15 major units enough, as well as being the "maximum practicable"? And how long would it take for the troops to be there, if the order were given tomorrow? (b) The study of security of frontiers (Item 15). The Committee will 
want to know when the study will be finished and perhaps to direct that it should also comment (see the brief on NI(71) 2) on the possible value of assistance from the forces of the Irish Republic. (c) The timing of all the various "planning" references (e. g. Items 16, 
17 and 21). 29th March? Will all these plans be ready to put into effect on or before

MINISTRY OF DEFENCE 12th March, 1971 As I mentioned to you on the telephone this afternoon, 
the Defence Secretary has decided that in view of the special circumstances in Northern Ireland we should not in future send Servicemen who are below the age of 18 to the Province for operational service with the Security Forces there. We shall gradually replace those under 18 who are already in Northern Ireland. 
Since he thought it fairly likely that the Press would 
otherwise continue during the weekend to make a major issue of the young soldiers in Northern Ireland, as was the case this morning, Lord Carrington considered that the decision should be announced this evening, in the terms of the attached statement. The Home Secretary’s office has also been informed of this intention. 
I am sending copies of this letter and the enclosure 
to Graham Angel, Nicholas Barrington, Peter Middleton, Leonard Davies and Brian Norbury.
