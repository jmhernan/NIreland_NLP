Cooking: Cooking is not done by electricity but by [] gas and the use of search lights therefore has no effect on the power available in the cook-hours; but there are electric hotplates in the mess halls and these developed a fault yesterday which was put right today. 3. Bunks: These are standard army issue. 4. Clothing: Internees were allowed to bring with them all the clothing they had in their possession. Those who wish to obtain a change of clothes can do so by having other garments brought in by relations or friends; alternatively if this is not possible clothing is issued to them. 5. Books: They were allowed to take in with them books they alread possessed and further supplies are being provided at Long Kesh as soon as possible. 75 newspapers are being provided free of charge daily."
