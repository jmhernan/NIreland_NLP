Where a breach of the peace is not committed, but the 
conduct of the pickets is intimidatory, they should be arrested only if there is no other way to get them to desist. In these circumstances the power of arrest to be used is SPA Regulation 11, in accordance with the Blue Card. The words to be used are: ""I suspect you of being about to commit (or of committing) acts prejudicial to the peace""."

The suggestion was made at the Ministers’ meeting on 9th February that one possibility might be to entrust law and order to a Governor having effective executive powers; he would be responsible to the United Kingdom Government, but the control would remain a local one. 
The main difficulty is that it seems 
unacceptable that, at any rate for more than a very brief period, responsibility for the main functions involved - control of the police, running the prisons, operating internment policy, all of which raise issues as to the rights and liberty of the subject should be exercised without there being ultimate responsibility to a democratically elected body; and responsibility to the United Kingdom Government would probably in the end turn out to be not very much different than if there were a direct transfer to Westminster."

Moreover, it was not a 
question of regarding a ban on marches as some kind of political offset against internment. The Protestants in Northern Ireland would regard internment as no more than a merited punishment for the violence of the IRA and their Roman Catholic supporters; they would not see it at all as something which required a corresponding gesture on the part of themselves. Since the Government would need full Protestant support for any new initiatives on political reconciliation which they might be able to undertake, it would be foolish to alienate Protestant support by an indiscriminate ban on marches."

As you know, although the main Protestant parades of July 
passed off without giving rise to any serious incidents, there has been a significant worsening in recent weeks in the amount and nature of terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, with frequent bomb attacks on an increasing scale and also the outbreaks of extremely vicious street fighting in Londonderry where there had previously been very little trouble for many months. This activity is clearly the work of the IRA; and the GOC has confirmed that the signs are that this body is getting better organised and more efficient in its methods. Earlier this week the GOC reported to the Defence Secretary, and also to the Home Secretary, that renewed pressure was building up within Mr. Faulkner’s Government for firm action against the IRA; and Mr. Faulkner has himself been in touch with the Home Secretary to suggest that the time may have come to think again about internment."

Neither the I.R.A., nor

Moreover, it was not a 
question of regarding a ban on marches as some kind of political offset against internment. The Protestants in Northern Ireland would regard internment as no more than a merited punishment for the violence of the IRA and their Roman Catholic supporters; they would not see it at all as something which required a corresponding gesture on the part of themselves. Since the Government would need full Protestant support for any new initiatives on political reconciliation which they might be able to undertake, it would be foolish to alienate Protestant support by an indiscriminate ban on marches.

As you know, although the main Protestant parades of July 
passed off without giving rise to any serious incidents, there has been a significant worsening in recent weeks in the amount and nature of terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, with frequent bomb attacks on an increasing scale and also the outbreaks of extremely vicious street fighting in Londonderry where there had previously been very little trouble for many months. This activity is clearly the work of the IRA; and the GOC has confirmed that the signs are that this body is getting better organised and more efficient in its methods. Earlier this week the GOC reported to the Defence Secretary, and also to the Home Secretary, that renewed pressure was building up within Mr. Faulkner’s Government for firm action against the IRA; and Mr. Faulkner has himself been in touch with the Home Secretary to suggest that the time may have come to think again about internment.

Regulation 12 already empowers 
the Minister of Home Affairs to make conditions of residence and reporting to the police and the like as an alternative to internment. 
If we took over internment, we could 
further modify the Regulation (and indeed it is understood that the Northern Ireland Government themselves had the possibility of a provision for conditional release in mind in any revision of the Regulations). 
But if under the 
existing Regulation internment were converted to a residence and reporting condition in the case of individuals it would seem to carry the advantage that the individuals would not cease to be persons judged to be a danger to public safety."

The internment operation has been a considerable success technically 
Those detained include a considerable number of both the Goulding and Brady wings of the IRA. The evidence is that both wings have been much more seriously disrupted than statements from IRA sources suggest, and while they will undoubtedly continue to give trouble, there is reasonable hope that, with increased vigilance at the border, terrorist activity wi11 now be at a lower level than in the weeks before internment."

How long anyone will be interned 
will depend on two factors; namely, the credibility of any undertaking an individual may give as to his future behaviour if he were to be released in advance of any general release, and in the other cases, the restoration of normal law and order in the community.

I think it 
is important to recall the position 
before internment was introduced, which I believe can be shown to have been one in which violence was already escalating very rapidly. 
If so, 
this should be brought but in order to answer the argument that internment has made the security situation worse.

I think one should rewind the House, who will hear a great deal

i think, calls for some details of (a)

the open statements they have made about their activites; and 
their recent demands as a price of calling off their campaign."
