85,IMG_9316,J_Denial,2,"When Mr. Whitelaw lunched today with Cardinal Heenan he 
discovered that the Cardinal had very little idea of the new procedures for detention. 
Cardinal Heenan said that he did not

91,IMG_9317,J_Denial,1,I agree that the Pope’s reference to internment was a disappointing feature of his message. The message suggests a possible misunderstanding of the situation.

We might also provide that hearsay evidence was to be admissible (and this would undoubtedly increase the number of cases in which we might look for a conviction).

that people suffered ill-treatment at the time of arrest or at a Regional Holding Centre - for example, the case of Mr. Cummings who was hooded and bound as a military precaution -, I can only say that it speaks volumes for the discipline and common sense of the many soldiers who were engaged in this large-scale and dangerous operation in which a total of 342 arrests were made that there were so very few cases of this kind and that when they did occur, on no occasion, in the Committee’s view, was ill-treatment deliberate."

No. As the Compton Report makes clear, the allegations that those of Mr. Cummings and Mr. 
Gilmore - did the Committee find that those arrested had suffered a measure of physical ill-treatment at the time of arrest, and this 
was not deliberate. When this is set against the total of 342 arrests which the troops made on 9 August, I can see little reason for changing the Army’s orders about arresting people."

A. In an operation of the kind that was carried out on 9 August 
there were bound to be some cases of mistaken identity. More often than not these could not be sorted out on the snot but once it was established that an arrested man was not the person who was wanted he was released. 
I am not aware of any cases where it has been shown that troops 
arrested people who were not wanted simply because they could not find the person they were looking for."

reduced the risk involved in setting free some of the internees, and increased the Availability of evidence on which others among them could be convicted."
1282,IMG_6574,J_Emergency-Policy,2,"At the first signs of a real improvement the word could be allowed to get around that, while internment as such was certainly not being dispensed with immediately, the way in which it was applied was under reconsideration,"
1283,IMG_6574,J_Emergency-Policy,3,"As regards those already in internment, the obvious way to 
indicate a fresh approach would be to step up, the release of those who, in the improved situation, were regarded as only marginally a threat to security."
1284,IMG_6574,J_Emergency-Policy,4,"As for the hard core of internees who could not safely be released, the hope would of course be to acquire sufficient evidence, in the improved situation, to be able to prosecute most of them."
1285,IMG_6574,J_Emergency-Policy,5,"As regards wanted men who are still at large, the Government 
would certainly not wish to dispense altogether with the option of arresting ringleaders but it could be hinted fairly clearly that, since witnesses were showing greater willingness to come forward, the emphasis would thenceforth be on prosecution rather than internment and that the latter would in invoked, if at all, only for the most dangerous terrorists who were arrested in future."
1286,IMG_6574,J_Emergency-Policy,6,(The public line on this could be very similar to that
1288,IMG_6575,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"used by the Secretary of State on the future of Interrogation; that the Government could not be expected to tie its hands, but would obviously be having full regard to 
- in this case - the improved security situation - and that the Press and public 
must read between the lines of those remarks."
1295,IMG_6609,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"My Lords, moving on from that time to the present, I think it might be helpful if I were first to describe the current security situation - 
since, however much we may 
recognise that there can be no purely military solution, it remains vital to realise that the pace of progress in the political (and for that matter the economic) fields is very largely dictated by the state of security,"
1302,IMG_6633,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"Of course we should prefer to see these people prosecuted and convicted if that were possible; but quite obviously it is not, so long as intimidation remains rife."
1309,IMG_6634,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"And it is not much good arguing that intimidation exists only in our imagination, when only two weeks ago a bus driver who was about to give evidence for the Crown in an important case - 
Mr. Sidney Agnew - was murdered by 
masked gunmen in front of his family."
1310,IMG_6634,J_Emergency-Policy,2,And this was by no means an isolated example; there have been frequent reports to show what the IRA do to people who talk. What further evidence can one possibly need of intimidation?
1311,IMG_6634,J_Emergency-Policy,3,So how can one possibly bring internment to a sudden end against that background? No responsible government could take such an unjustifiable risk with the lives of soldiers and policemen and loyal citizens generally.
1312,IMG_6634,J_Emergency-Policy,4,"What one can however do is to keep the policy of internment under review, so that those internees who are considered no longer to be a threat to security are released without delay, and so that - whenever witnesses are brave enough to come forward 
- the internee in question can be prosecuted."
1316,IMG_6699,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"It will be important to record all such evidence, whether or 
not substantiated, of IRA intimidation: since it will be crucial to the British response to the case being brought by the Irish Government before the Commission on Human Rights at Strasbourg, so far as it is concerned with internment as an alleged violation of Article Five 
- intimidation being the basic reason why the terrorists 
cannot be dealt with through the normal processes of the law."

1374,IMG_6773,J_Emergency-Policy,3,HE WONDERED WHETHER IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO DEVISE A PROGRAMME FOR RELEASE OF INTERNEES WHICH COULD BE STARTED ONCE VIOLENCE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL.
1379,IMG_6778,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"We quite apreciate that the political impact 
would be greater if it could be announced that, along with accelerating the release of those already interned, there would be no further internment orders: but there are important security reasons for not doing this."
1386,IMG_6779,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"Further, the Army’s willingness to see a larger 
number of the present internees released rests on the assumption that it will still be possible to re-arrest any who are found to be engaging in violence again."
1393,IMG_6893,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"A gradual phasing-out of internment (which would probably stop short of the hard core internees until it was reasonably clear that the IRA campaign was at an end), possibly coupled with the institution of some form of quasi-judicial procedure in special courts."

1428,IMG_6955,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"I have received on this issue the clearest possible advice from the Army and Police, which is embodied in the attached Memorandum to the Cabinet here.

1429,IMG_6955,J_Emergency-Policy,2,"As you know, and as paragraph 10(4) of my Memorandum points out, I am attracted to the idea of introducing at an early date a form of legislation to replace the Special Powers, which would come into effect on an appointed day after violence had ended, and would inter alia then place the power of internment in suspense, to be subsequently invoked only on the declaration of a State of Emergency."
1435,IMG_6957,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"I replied that I 
shared the view of the Army that it was vital to get on top of the IRA before making any move in this direction"
1436,IMG_6957,J_Emergency-Policy,2,"It must be added that these are capable of inflicting casualties 
on the security forces and of maintaining limited attacks on civilian targets for some time to come, especially outside Belfast."
1437,IMG_6957,J_Emergency-Policy,3,"The first is the fact, already noted, that the IRA presence has been removed from certain areas and that this is continuing; though it is unfortunately true that those who have most to fear from the IRA are least articulate in pointing to the comparative freedom from intimidation which they are beginning to enjoy."
1442,IMG_6958,J_Emergency-Policy,1,The Joint Security Committee have noted these conclusions and have accepted
1449,IMG_6968,J_Emergency-Policy,1,that security grounds rule out any releases other than through the machinery of the Advisory Committee.
1450,IMG_6968,J_Emergency-Policy,2,"It is difficult to visualize any solid advantages which might outweigh 
these security objections."
1451,IMG_6968,J_Emergency-Policy,3,"As indicated in a separate memorandum, legislation is under consideration

1470,IMG_7053,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"Specifically rejected are:(a) any place in Government for representatives of the minority community as of right;

political initiative should be the appointment of a new Secretary of State in the British Government, to take over from the Home Secretary his present responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs, some indication that the policy of internment is being wound down (so that there is a prospect of increasing releases as and when violence dies down), and probably the transfer of responsibility for law and order from Stormont to Westminster."

(a) 
adequate in substancebearing in mind that internment and security would be only joint functions, with no certainty that the will of the United Kingdom Government would prevail; and that the ""further constitutional changes"" which the Northern Ireland Government envisage would not in fact guarantee the minority an effective share in the government and administration of the Province as of right"
1582,IMG_7246,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"The Advisory Committee on Internment have been reviewing internment cases and recommending release where, because of a change in attitude, there is considered to be no appreciable degree of risk."

1589,IMG_7249,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"If that is agreed, it is important 
not to lose sight of the fact that neither releases from internment nor internment orders themselves are pure acts of policy. 
If an internment order depends on the 
individual concerned being a danger to public security, then his release must imply that that danger is no longer present. 
some new situation arises, ie that he himself re-engages in illegal activity or that the general situation has deteriorated."

category C. internees are all about equal from the point of view of danger to the public safety, then the moment some of them are released the continued detention of the others in category C. is called into question.

they do so, the case for re-interning them is very much stronger."
1597,IMG_7251,J_Emergency-Policy,2,"But if under the

1645,IMG_0032,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"But, however comprehensive the specific powers that 
are available, it will be inherent in the nature of the operation that individual members of the security forces will be faced even more than usual with taking instant decisions on whether and how to act (eg whether to open fire) and it is thought essential, if the security forces are not to be seriously inhibited, that such decisions should be taken without the fear of their legality"
1652,IMG_0036,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"If, as postulated, the operation provided for the arrest not only of

1659,IMG_0040,J_Emergency-Policy,1,A provision (not yet fully worked out) would be desirable to authorise the setting up of special or additional civilian criminal courts or to modify the procedure for the trial of offences in order to prevent undue delay in the administration of justice during the emergency period.

1673,IMG_0175,J_Emergency-Policy,1,The meeting may therefore be prepared to accept the advice of officials backed by the Attorney General; but Ministers will no doubt wish to ask the Attorney to keep under close review the number of private prosecutions and civil actions lest a situation should arise so exceptional as to call for special measures on the lines indicated by the report.
1680,IMG_0159,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"The Security Forces would continue to take action against those who break the law or who engage in terrorist activities. In fact for the Army it would be ""business as usual"" at least until there were real signs of the intention of a ceasefire being translated into fact."
1687,IMG_0160,J_Emergency-Policy,1,Legislation is therefore being prepared and this may include those emergency powers which will still be required if the Government decides to repeal the Special Powers Act.
1694,IMG_5974,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"In connection with a civil action which is being brought 
in the Northern Ireland courts against the RUC and the Ministry of Defence, as a result of the arrests made on 9th August, we consider it necessary to claim Crown Privilege for some of the documents which would otherwise have to be disclosed in the action. Since the claim would be made for reasons of security, it needs the approval not only of the Attorney General (which is being sought concurrently by the Treasury Solicitor) but also of the Prime Minister, before the Secretary of State can sign the necessary certificate."
1701,IMG_6305,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"First, the reason for interment is simply that while a good 
deal is known about active IRA members, the evidence, such as it is, 
would not inimost cases stand up in court. Examples are attached of the kind of information which is known about individuals. Much of it is simply not up to the standards of evidence required in the courts."
1702,IMG_6305,J_Emergency-Policy,2,"Secondly, even if the evidence did stand up, there are obvious and overriding objections to disclosing its nature to the defence or arranging for a confrontation between the security services and the person involved 
- which is the minimum of that is required for the hearing 
to be described as being in any way before a court."
1703,IMG_6305,J_Emergency-Policy,3,Wesshould put individuals in peril; and prejudice the sources of the information.
1704,IMG_6305,J_Emergency-Policy,4,The Attorney General cannot see how any moral accusatorial procedure could work.
1708,IMG_6306,J_Emergency-Policy,1,The Attorney General and Mr Dalton only confirm our view however that the alternative of beinging the men to trial is not the answer.
1715,IMG_7621,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"The policy to be followed oh the making of arrests was worked out and 
agreed with the security forces on Monday."
1722,IMG_7694,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"ensure that instructions are issued to the RUC on the importance of distinguishing between the type of questioning appropriate to a prisoner against whom charges are likely to be brought in court and the type appropriate when the object is simply to secure intelligence. 
(The actual 
conduct of interrogation for intelligence purposes will be discussed later in the meeting.)"
1729,IMG_7697,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"As regards the Directive on Interrogation you asked that the Ministers 
concerned should specifically consider whether they regarded it as suitable for publication if, in extreme circumstances, we felt that we had no alternative but to publish it. 
In so far as considerations of security 
are involved, the JIG have reaffirmed their view that there would be no ultimate objection to publication; and Ministers have been so advised individually."
1736,IMG_7699,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"To legislate 
to prevent those still detained from taking proceedings to challenge any invalidity in an internment order would be to return in effect to the regime of arbitrary imprisonment without trial under cover of a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Acts."
1743,IMG_7700,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"An indemnity which 
prevented those still detained from taking legal proceedings to challenge their detention would be a breach of Article 5 of the Convention and, unlike internment itself, could hardly be justified as a measure of derogation required by the exigencies of the emergency situation."
1750,IMG_7701,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"These considerations suggest that an Indemnity Bill should not be 
introduced unless a pressing need arises on security or other policy grounds."
1751,IMG_7701,J_Emergency-Policy,2,"or a situation night arise in which a spate of civil actions gave rise to serious problems in relation to the disclosure of the identity of those involved in security operations. 
If such a situation arose the natter would need to be reconsidered."
1752,IMG_7701,J_Emergency-Policy,3,"But no need seems to arise at present Unless we are confronted with a 
spate of private prosecutions or civil actions giving rise to security or other possible problems, it would be best to consider whether an Indemnity Act is appropriate when order has been restored, and the work of reconstruction and reconciliation has been started; that would be the most suitable time for the enactment of any Indemnity Act. 
In that 
situation there is a more persuasive case for a once for all enactment which will cover appropriate cases over the whole period of the emergency."
1757,IMG_7727,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"And 
can we be confident that the Official wing would maintain its ""cease fire"" if (as we surely must) we stood firm against IRA participation and any ""amnesty"" or termination of internment that was not warranted by the security situation?"
1764,IMG_7783,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"Third, there are about 80 terrorists, including most of the key ones, against whom we are not in a position to prefer charges of the normal sort partly because they do not themselves indulge over much in specific acts of terrorism, but rather organise them: partly because it is extremely difficult to get any evidence against them which will stand up in a court of law: and partly because the witnesses we might bring against them would all be in danger of their lives."
1765,IMG_7783,J_Emergency-Policy,2,"n sum, we are in the position under the existing law and powers whereby we cannot deal with the key terrorists, even after we have caught them, other than by internment."
1771,IMG_7785,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"It will be possible to charge some with criminal offences under the ordinary law; but others and perhaps the most important of them are beyond the reach of the criminal law partly because witnesses cannot be expected to come forward to give oral evidence in the ordinary way, and partly because the evidence available to connect accused persons with specific offences as opposed to general complicity in terrorism is sometimes tenuous,particularly in the case of the most important provisional IRA leaders."
1778,IMG_7842,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"he meeting discussed the current arrest and interrogation policies against 
the background of a serious level of military casualties, which had already given rise to press enquiries."
1785,IMG_7886,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"MR WHITELAW REITERATED THAT IT WAS HMG’S POLICY TO END INTERNMENT AS SOON AS THE SECURITY SITUATION ALTERED, AND HE EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTIES IN THIS (APART OF COURSE FROM THAT OF THE MORALE OF PART OF THE SECURITY FORCES)."

1799,IMG_7898,J_Emergency-Policy,1,The Secretary of State added that it is still HMG’s policy to phase out internment as soon as the security situation permits; the only point of issue between HMG and the SDLP
1806,IMG_7899,J_Emergency-Policy,1,is on timing.
1813,IMG_7902,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"He thought that the SDLP could maintain their credibility if, after this meeting, they put out a statement on the lines that they had again put their case to the Secretary of State; that they had been told that HMG would keep the position under review; that they were disappointed that more internees had not been let out; and that the Secretary of State had made it clear that it remained HMG policy to phase out internment depending on the security situation."

1834,IMG_7947,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"Both the Secretary of State and Mr Maudling when Home Secretary had repeatedly referred to the need to retain internment for security reasons, implying that when the security situation was satisfactory the en would no longer be held as hostages."
1841,IMG_7950,J_Emergency-Policy,1,Some of those still in internment were dedicated to the most extreme forms of violence.
1848,IMG_7951,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"A statement would be released to the press explaining that the action had been taken in the light of the new situation in which the security forces were dominating the areas where the IRA had operated in the past. He would consider further, in the light of the security situation, what the SDLP had said."
1855,IMG_8005,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"It envisages rather that persons against whom there is insufficient evidence to secure a conviction under the criminal law (including the Special Powers Act provisions) should nevertheless be detained if their conduct has involved them in ""complicity in any degree with terrorism generally"". The ordinary rules of evidence will not be applied and the normal rights of an accused person in the criminal courts will not be available to him.

consider how far the powers conferred under that Act could be dispensed with."
1884,IMG_8052,J_Emergency-Policy,2,"Nevertheless, certain basic problems of countering terrorism 
by the normal processes of law still present difficulties. These include the problem of preventing the intimidation of Witnesses who may be in danger of their lives if they give evidence in court; and of bringing to trial many of those who, although responsible for organising and directing terrorism, take care to avoid so far as possible themselves engaging in terrorist operations. The system of internment cannot be ended without putting something in its place."
1890,IMG_8053,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"The Government reaffirm their determination to improve the security situation in Northern Ireland and to deal with terrorists, including those who, for the reasons indicated earlier, cannot be dealt with through the normal processes of the criminal law."

1905,IMG_8057,J_Emergency-Policy,2,"Meantime, the Government reaffirms its determination to 
improve the security situation in Northern Ireland and to deal with terrorists, including those who, for the reasons indicated earlier, cannot easily be dealt with through the normal processes of the criminal law. 
Pending the report of the commission and of 
the subsequent legislation on it, the Government therefore proposes at an early date to introduce interim legislation under the Special Powers Act to set up a special tribunal to deal with persons accused of terrorist activities by means of a procedure which will preserve the essentials of natural justice, but which will be matched to the special conditions which unfortunately obtain in Northern Ireland. 
This tribunal will be asked to 
consider cases referred to it by the Secretary of State (which will include cases of those presently in internment), to determine the nature of their involvement in terrorist activities, and either to order release or to impose a definite period of detention."
1911,IMG_8058,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"Moreover, these Interim provisions will be

(paragraph 4 of his memorandum) that he cannot go on much longer on the present basis; and the Committee may agree that the long-term political objections to Course II must yield to the immediate requirements of security."
1932,IMG_8063,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"If this were acceptable in terms 
of security, it would represent a more definite move in the right direction and a more constructive earnest of the Government’s intentions than the essentially negative presentation adopted by the draft statement, particularly in the sentence at the end of the third paragraph."
1939,IMG_8108,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"But it will undoubtedly be politically controversial to introduce judicial processes different from those of the normal courts (although the Secretary of State deploys the counter arguments in paragraph 5 of the Annex to GEN 79(72) 19); and the Attorney General, who may well be"
1946,IMG_8109,J_Emergency-Policy,1,"supported by the Lord Chancellor, is likely to emphasise the difficulty of associating judges with the kind of court described in paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to GEN 79(72) 17."
1947,IMG_8109,J_Emergency-Policy,2,"As regards the ""hard core"" who cannot be released, the Secretary of State proposes that, pending the creation of the special courts, the individuals concerned should continue to be detained under Regulation 11, subject to review by a ""special interim body""."

4228,IMG_7226,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"The categories for this phasing out will be agreed by the Joint Security Committee, which will be augmented by a United Kingdom Minister, who will be joint chairman of the Committee with the Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs; each of these joint chairmen will have a right of veto; 
The formal authority 
in connection with internment, whether for purposes of release or future internment, will continue to rest with the Northern Ireland Minister for Home Affairs; and the representative of the United Kingdom Government will be associated with him in the decisions on individual cases."

4242,IMG_7246,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"The Advisory Committee on Internment have been reviewing internment cases and recommending release where, because of a change in attitude, there is considered to be no appreciable degree of risk."
4249,IMG_7251,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"Regulation 12 already empowers 
the Minister of Home Affairs to make conditions of residence and reporting to the police and the like as an alternative to internment. 
If we took over internment, we could 
further modify the Regulation (and indeed it is understood that the Northern Ireland Government themselves had the possibility of a provision for conditional release in mind in any revision of the Regulations). 
But if under the 
existing Regulation internment were converted to a residence and reporting condition in the case of individuals it would seem to carry the advantage that the individuals would not cease to be persons judged to be a danger to public safety."

Ireland is establishing immediately a procedure to review each case personally."
4263,IMG_7290,J_Legal_Procedure,1,As I promised I have begun to review personally the cases of the 728 people still interned under the Special Powers Act.
4270,IMG_7291,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"In addition to the internees, 26 men who were detained under Regulation 11 of the Special Powers Act have been released today."
4277,IMG_7508,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"The arrest of eight men last night, four of whom were on a ’wanted’ list, 
raises the question in what circumstances such arrests should be made. Three of the men are thought to be senior officers of the Belfast Provisionals. The question is which people should be arrested and for what purposes; criminal charges, questioning under the Special Powers Act, or in rare cases detention or internment. The Northern Ireland Office will arrange for the subject to be considered by the Joint Security Committee in Northern Ireland."
4284,IMG_0032,J_Legal_Procedure,1,Most of the powers which the security forces are expected to recuire for the implementation of this plan are already available under the Special Powers Regulations.
4291,IMG_0040,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"A number of legal powers, in addition to the existing powers under 
the Northern Ireland special powers legislation, would be required to be conferred to enable the Armed Forces to carry out efficiently the role allotted to them in the new emergency situation."
4292,IMG_0040,J_Legal_Procedure,2,A provision (not yet fully worked out) would be desirable to authorise the setting up of special or additional civilian criminal courts or to modify the procedure for the trial of offences in order to prevent undue delay in the administration of justice during the emergency period.
4298,IMG_0175,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"Officials point out that the question of 
indemnity only arises when the wide powers conferred under the Special Powers Acts are exceeded; that there are obvious objections to the enactment of a general indemnity before order has been restored and all detainees released; and that any form of indemnity which appreciably abridges existing domestic remedies in respect of the breaches of the Human Rights Convention alleged by the Government of the Republic would undermine our case against the admissibility of the allegations before the Commission at Strasbourg"

4326,IMG_0160,J_Legal_Procedure,1,Lord Diplock has presented the report of his Commission on legal procedures to deal with terrorist activities and the Government has announced its intention to implement his recommendations.
4327,IMG_0160,J_Legal_Procedure,2,Legislation is therefore being prepared and this may include those emergency powers which will still be required if the Government decides to repeal the Special Powers Act.
4328,IMG_0160,J_Legal_Procedure,3,"The Commission recognised that there was a continuing need for detention by the executive, but they proposed, amongst other things, various changes in court procedures which will be of considerable assistance to the Security Forces."

He has, in fact, released every internee whose release the Committee has recommended."
4340,IMG_5974,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"Since that decision, all the other original arrests have either (as has happened in most cases) been overtaken by internment orders, or 
the arrested 
persons have been released. And, of course, the more recent arrests made under the Special Powers Act have been carried out in what the courts held to be the correct manner."

The Advisory Committee has been making good headway and to date has reviewed 99 cases; of these they have recommended release for 10 men and continued internment for 83 with consideration deferred for the remaining 6. Of the 10 cases recommended for release 7 men have actually been sent home and release has been directed in one other case; 2 cases are at present under my consideration.

4382,IMG_6045,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"You asked why Judge Brown’s Advisory Committee on 
Internment Appeals seemed to have come to a standstill. In fact, their work is continuing and the figures in the note which you saw (implying no increase in the number of cases considered over the past week) were incorrect. 64 cases have now been considered. 7 have been released (including 2 released today). They have decided not to release 48 and 9 cases are still pending. But the number of cases considered will continue to grow. The Committee say that the main limitation on their speed of working is the time taken by solicitors to prepare cases for submission to them."
4389,IMG_6049,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"In order to avoid the impression that there is any unnecessary

Initial discussions with the Northern Ireland Government, conducted at the end of last week, indicated that they were likely to accept the need for changes both in the legal forms relating to internment (e.g. in the direction of informing the internee of the grounds for interning him) and in the administrative treatment of those in internment (e.g. in the direction of segregating the hard-"

be asked to carry on dealing with complaints from persons arrested with a view to internment. This, together with the arrangements which were being made for a Board of Visitors to hear complaints of people once they were received into prison, should fill the gap which had been criticised."
4417,IMG_6262,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"The Home Secretary said that much of the criticism in the recent debate 
had centred on procedures for internment. If these could be modified it would be easier to retain support for the principle of internment itself. Mr. Faulkner said that this was under active consideration."
4418,IMG_6262,J_Legal_Procedure,2,"He had it in mind that an internee might be told in writing of the allegation against him: the statement would be on the lines that he was a member of an unlawful association, or actively involved in the recent campaign of violence."
4424,IMG_6305,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"This is also the view of Mr Dalton, He said that the evidence put before the Advisory Committee by Special Branch was adequate to enable the Committee to reach a judgment, but that it would not convince a court."

Several of those whose arrests on 9th August, 1971, were judged invalid on purely technical grounds were immediately re-arrested under a valid formula."
4473,IMG_7697,J_Legal_Procedure,1,"If so, the new Directive should be issued without further delay; and in the case of Northern Ireland it should be accompanied, as the Attorney General has suggested, by a specific reminder about the domestic law on the subject in the Six Counties."

4495,IMG_7785,J_Legal_Procedure,2,"The most promising possibility is to create a system 
of special courts whose function would not be to convict accused persons of criminal offences, but to judge whether they were guilty of certain specified conduct and commit them to ""preventive detention"" if they were. The Act making this provision (as to the necessity of an Act see below) could be of 6 months duration renewable by Order in Council."

A special court would consist of a judge of the Supreme Court sitting with any other judge of the Supreme Court or a county court judge or a resident magistrate.
4510,IMG_7787,J_Legal_Procedure,3,The court would be obliged to inform the accused at least of the general tenor of the evidence against him and to hear him or his counsel in his defence.

HM Government made clear that it was their objective to the system of internment under the Special Powers Act as

the subsequent legislation on it, the Government therefore proposes at an early date to introduce interim legislation under the Special Powers Act to set up a special tribunal to deal with persons accused of terrorist activities by means of a procedure which will preserve the essentials of natural justice, but which will be matched to the special conditions which unfortunately obtain in Northern Ireland."

consider cases referred to it by the Secretary of State (which will include cases of those presently in internment), to determine the nature of their involvement in terrorist activities, and either to order release or to impose a definite period of detention."
4592,IMG_8108,J_Legal_Procedure,1,Proposal (ii) admittedly reverses the normal onus of proof - i. e. it is incumbent on the defendant to establish his innocence instead of on the prosecution to establish his guilt. But this seems inherent in the nature of the case.
4593,IMG_8108,J_Legal_Procedure,2,In favour of the proposal to introduce special courts or tribunals (which is also discussed in Appendix 1 to GEN 79(72) 17) it can be argued that we should in principle be substituting a judicial process for the executive machinery which at present governs internment and detention.

7637,IMG_0211,J_Political-Strategic,1,"This, 
however, must be on the basis that all marches would be banned indefinitely; even if the Government of Northern Ireland’s powers in this respect were of only limited duration, they would have to be periodically renewed."
7638,IMG_0211,J_Political-Strategic,2,It would also be essential that the policy should be seen to be impartial in its application; and it would presumably be desirable for this purpose that those interned should include a certain number of Protestants.

which would be thought to be directed against one faction and must accordingly be matched by some political action, in the form of a ban on marches, which would represent its counterpart in relation to the other faction."
7645,IMG_0212,J_Political-Strategic,2,"Moreover, it was not a 
question of regarding a ban on marches as some kind of political offset against internment. The Protestants in Northern Ireland would regard internment as no more than a merited punishment for the violence of the IRA and their Roman Catholic supporters; they would not see it at all as something which required a corresponding gesture on the part of themselves. Since the Government would need full Protestant support for any new initiatives on political reconciliation which they might be able to undertake, it would be foolish to alienate Protestant support by an indiscriminate ban on marches."
7646,IMG_0212,J_Political-Strategic,3,In further discussion British Ministers re-emphasised that internment would represent a major political decision which must be matched by some corresponding act of discipline against the other faction.
7651,IMG_0213,J_Political-Strategic,1,"But in so far as Mr Faulkner took them into his confidence, he must make it wholly clear to them that the British Cabinet would not acquiesce in internment unless marches were banned."

7693,IMG_0255,J_Political-Strategic,1,"As you know, although the main Protestant parades of July 
passed off without giving rise to any serious incidents, there has been a significant worsening in recent weeks in the amount and nature of terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, with frequent bomb attacks on an increasing scale and also the outbreaks of extremely vicious street fighting in Londonderry where there had previously been very little trouble for many months. This activity is clearly the work of the IRA; and the GOC has confirmed that the signs are that this body is getting better organised and more efficient in its methods. Earlier this week the GOC reported to the Defence Secretary, and also to the Home Secretary, that renewed pressure was building up within Mr. Faulkner’s Government for firm action against the IRA; and Mr. Faulkner has himself been in touch with the Home Secretary to suggest that the time may have come to think again about internment."

central factor in the Catholic’cmmunity’s willingness or wnwillingnese to o-operate, it would be both feasible and essential

7805,IMG_6574,J_Terrorism,1,"As regards wanted men who are still at large, the Government 
would certainly not wish to dispense altogether with the option of arresting ringleaders but it could be hinted fairly clearly that, since witnesses were showing greater willingness to come forward, the emphasis would thenceforth be on prosecution rather than internment and that the latter would in invoked, if at all, only for the most dangerous terrorists who were arrested in future."
7812,IMG_6576,J_Terrorism,1,"If Ministers in London agree that it would be right, in a period of much-reduced terrorist activity, to ease up on security measures generally and internment in particular, they will wish to consider how they could best carry the Northern Ireland Government with them in thus varyingthe tactics

co-operation of the Northern Ireland authorities would be essential if the new approach were to achieve its object of generating further de-escalation, especially where internment is concerned."
7819,IMG_6577,J_Terrorism,1,"As you know, there are immediate problems in providing 
sufficient accommodation for internees and detainees in Northern Ireland to keep pace with the number of terrorists on whom detention and internment orders are being served."
7826,IMG_6609,J_Terrorism,1,"We took note then my Lords of the effect which internment had already begun to have, in denying to dangerous men the freedom of movement which they had previously enjoyed, and in greatly increasing the flow of intelligence about further terrorists and their activities."
7827,IMG_6609,J_Terrorism,2,"And we recognised then that, despite these improvements, it would be most unsafe to attempt to forecast how long it would take before terrorism could be brought to a halt."
7833,IMG_6634,J_Terrorism,1,And this was by no means an isolated example; there have been frequent reports to show what the IRA do to people who talk. What further evidence can one possibly need of intimidation?
7834,IMG_6634,J_Terrorism,2,So how can one possibly bring internment to a sudden end against that background? No responsible government could take such an unjustifiable risk with the lives of soldiers and policemen and loyal citizens generally.
7840,IMG_6699,J_Terrorism,1,"It will be important to record all such evidence, whether or 
not substantiated, of IRA intimidation: since it will be crucial to the British response to the case being brought by the Irish Government before the Commission on Human Rights at Strasbourg, so far as it is concerned with internment as an alleged violation of Article Five 
- intimidation being the basic reason why the terrorists 
cannot be dealt with through the normal processes of the law."

Since the Government would need full Protestant support for any new initiatives on political reconciliation which they might be able to undertake, it would be foolish to alienate Protestant support by an indiscriminate ban on marches."

This activity is clearly the work of the IRA; and the GOC has confirmed that the signs are that this body is getting better organised and more efficient in its methods. Earlier this week the GOC reported to the Defence Secretary, and also to the Home Secretary, that renewed pressure was building up within Mr. Faulkner’s Government for firm action against the IRA; and Mr. Faulkner has himself been in touch with the Home Secretary to suggest that the time may have come to think again about internment."

Those detained include a considerable number of both the Goulding and Brady wings of the IRA.

Neither the I.R.A., nor

If major acts of terrorism took place after the ending of internment his position would be impossible.

9163,IMG_7900,J_Utilitarian-Deterrence,1,The Secretary of State said that he noted this point but felt that it would not be possible; if a date were issued the Provisional IRA would increase their violence to try and ensure that the deadline was not kept to.

Those detained include a considerable number of both the Goulding and Brady wings of the IRA.

the open statements they have made about their activites; and 
their recent demands as a price of calling off their campaign."
